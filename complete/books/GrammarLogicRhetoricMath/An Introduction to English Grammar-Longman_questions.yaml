    The number of exercises has been increased, and the exercises now appear at the
    end of the relevant chapter, rather than in a section of their own. The exercises are
    intended to help students understand the text and give them practice in applying
    the grammar. Some of the exercises introduce topics that are not dealt with expli-
    citly in the text. These are generally essay-style exercises, in which students are
    encouraged to explore linguistic topics on their own, using the new Further Read-
    ing section as a starting point. Many of the exercises were compiled by Professor
    Charles F. Meyer (University of Massachusetts-Boston).

    I will be using the word grammar in this book to refer to the set of rules that
    allow us to combine words in our language into larger units. Another term for
    grammar in this sense is syntax.

    Some combinations of words are possible in English and others are not. As a
    speaker of English, you can judge that "Home computers are now much cheaper" is a
    possible English sentence whereas "Home computers now much are cheaper" is not,
    because you know that "much" is wrongly positioned in the second example. Your
    ability to recognize such distinctions is evidence that in some sense you know the
    rules of grammar even if you have never studied any grammar. Similarly, you
    operate the rules whenever you speak or write (you can put words in the right
    order) and whenever you interpret what others say (you know that "Susan likes Tom"
    means something quite different from "Tom likes Susan"). But knowing the rules
    in evaluative and operational senses does not mean that you can say what the
    rules are.

    You acquire a working knowledge of your native language simply through being
    exposed to it from early childhood: nobody taught you, for example, where to posi-
    tion much. You study grammar, however, if you want to be able to analyse your
    language. The analytic grammar makes explicit the knowledge of the rules with
    which you operate when you use the language. There is a clear difference between
    the operational grammar and the analytic grammar. After all, many languages have
    never been analysed and some have been analysed only relatively recently. People
    were speaking and writing English long before the first English grammars appeared
    at the end of the sixteenth century.

    1.2 Grammar and other aspects of language

    Linguistic communications are channelled mainly through our senses of sound and
    sight. Grammar is the central component of language. It mediates between the
    system of sounds or of written symbols, on the one hand, and the system of
    meaning, on the other. Phonology is the usual term for the sound system in the
    language: the distinctive sound units and the ways which they may be combined.
    Orthography parallels phonology in that it deals with the writing system in
    the language: the distinctive written symbols and their possible combinations.
    Semantics is concerned with the system of meanings in the language: the mean-
    ings of words and the combinatory meanings of larger units.

    Phonology

    Semantics

    <—+ Grammar -

    Orthography

    Three other aspects of language description are often distinguished: phonetics,
    morphology, and pragmatics. Phonetics deals with the physical characteristics of
    the sounds in the language and how the sounds are produced. Sounds and letters
    combine to form words or parts of words. Morphology refers to the set of rules
    that describe the structure of words. The word computer, for example, consists of
    two parts: the base compute (used separately as a verb) and the suffix -er (found in
    other nouns derived from verbs, e.g. blender). Pragmatics is concerned with the
    use of particular utterances within particular situations. For example, Will you join
    our group? is a question that, depending on the speaker's intention, is either a
    request for information or a request for action.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.

    For descriptive purposes, it is convenient to deal with the components of
    language separately, but because of the central place of grammar in the language
    system, it is sometimes necessary to refer to the other components when we
    discuss the grammar.

    1.3 Grammars of English

    There are many grammars of English, that is to say books describing English
    grammar. They differ in how much of the grammar they cover and in how they set
    out the rules. There are also some differences in the categorization and termin-
    ology they use. Nevertheless, most categories and terms are widely shared, deriving
    from a long tradition of grammatical description.

    The grammatical analysis in this book follows the approach found in A Compre-
    hensive Grammar of the English Language by Randolph Quirk, Sidney Greenbaum,
    Geoffrey Leech, and Jan Svartvik. First published in 1985, that is a reference work
    on contemporary English grammar that contains nearly 1800 pages. Future refer-
    ence works of this scope are likely to be even longer. Despite the immense amount
    of research on contemporary English in the last few decades, many grammatical
    phenomena have yet to be discovered and described.

    1.4 National varieties

    English is the first language of over 300 million people. Most of them live in the
    United States of America, which has about 230 million native speakers of English,
    Rules and Variation

    and the United Kingdom, with about 54 million. Other countries with large
    numbers of English native speakers that also constitute the majority of the popula-
    tion are Canada (about 16 million), Australia (about 19 million), the Irish Republic
    (about 3.8 million), and New Zealand (about 3.9 million). Some countries have
    concentrations of English native speakers, though they do not constitute the majority
    of the population; for example, South Africa has about 1.6 million native English
    speakers apart from about 8.5 million bilingual speakers of English. While recog-
    nizing that these people all speak English, we can distinguish the national varieties
    they use as American English, British English, Canadian English, and so on.

    English is a second language for over 300 million people who speak another
    language as their native tongue but also use English in communicating with their
    compatriots. For example, the first language for about 30 per cent of Canadians is
    French and for millions of Americans it is Spanish. English is also the second
    language in countries where only a small minority speak it as their tongue but
    where it is the official language or joint official language for government business.
    Among these countries is India, where it is estimated that about 21 million people
    speak English fluently as their second language (though these constitute only about
    3 per cent of India's vast population). Other countries where English is the official
    or joint official language include Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, the Philippines, Puerto
    Rico (where about 1.3 million inhabitants are bilingual in Spanish and English),
    Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Since the English in each of these
    countries has certain distinctive features, it is reasonable to refer to such national
    varieties as, for example, Indian English or Nigerian English.

    Finally, English is studied as the primary foreign language in most other coun-
    tries. One estimate is that over 150 million children are currently studying
    English as a foreign language in primary or secondary schools. Its popularity lies
    in its value as an international language. A knowledge of English is perceived in
    most parts of the world as essential for international communication in commerce
    and tourism, in economic and military aid, and in scientific and technological
    literature.

    1.5 Standard and non-standard English

    In addition to differences between national varieties of English, there are differ-
    ences within each national variety. Each has a number of dialects. In countries
    where the majority speak English as their first language one dialect is used nation-
    ally for official purposes. It is called Standard English.

    Standard English is the national dialect that generally appears in print. It is
    taught in schools, and students are expected to use it in their essays. It is the norm
    for dictionaries and grammars. We expect to find it in official printed communica-
    tions, such as letters from government officials, solicitors, and accountants. We
    expect to hear it in national news broadcasts and documentary programmes on
    radio or television.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.

    Within each national variety the standard dialect is relatively homogeneous
    in grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and punctuation. Pronunciation is a different
    matter, since there is no equivalent standard accent (type of pronunciation). For
    each national variety there are regional accents, related to a geographical area, and
    social accents, related to the educational, socio-economic, and ethnic backgrounds
    of the speakers. In British English, Received Pronunciation (RP) is a non-regional
    social accent associated with public school education but it is not regarded as a
    standard accent to be learned in schools throughout the country. It is spoken by
    about 3 per cent of the population in Britain.

    Standard English has prestige because people connect it with education and
    with higher-income groups. It is not intrinsically better than other dialects, though
    many believe it is. One of its major advantages is that it has developed a range of
    styles to suit different kinds of uses of the language, particularly in writing.

    Non-standard dialects tend to be restricted to people from a particular region or
    from a particular social group or to social groups within a region. Many people
    speak more than one dialect, perhaps using different dialects at home and at work.

    1.6 Variation according to use

    Language also varies according to context and communicative purpose. For ex-
    ample, newspapers, cookery books, scientific papers, emails, poetry, and fiction all
    have distinctive language features. Newspapers have a distinctive layout, headlines
    are often highly compressed (Banks warned on student loans), cookery books tend
    to use many imperatives (Mix the ingredients), scientific papers use many passive
    constructions (A colourless gas is produced). These varieties are known as registers,
    that is, varieties of language associated with specific uses and communicative
    purposes.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.

    Some variation depends on the medium, that is, the channel of communication.
    There is a major distinction between spoken and written language. Conversation,
    the most common type of speech, involves immediate interchange between the
    participants, who convey their reactions either in words or through facial expres-
    sions and bodily movements. There is more spontaneity in conversation than in
    writing; self-correction occurs in the flow of conversation, whereas it is eliminated
    through editing in writing. Writing needs to be more explicit, since obscurities and
    misunderstandings cannot be removed immediately. People feel more committed
    to what they write because of the potential permanence of the written communica-
    tion. The differences in the nature of the media is reflected in the greater concision
    that is possible in writing and in the greater care that writers take over their choice
    of words.

    Language also varies according to the attitude of the speaker or writer towards
    the listener or reader, towards the topic, and towards the purpose of communi-
    cation. We can select from features that range from the most formal to the most
    informal. For instance, comprehend and strive are more formal than their respective
    equivalents, understand and try. Similarly, This is the student to whom I gave the
    message is more formal than Thus is the student I gave the message to.

    Grammatical variation across spoken and written registers is a central theme
    of the Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English by Douglas Biber et al.
    (1999). In Chapter 10 we examine the grammatical features of a range of English
    registers, including conversations, sports commentaries, emails, and literary texts.

    1.7 Descriptive rules and prescriptive rules

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Communication Medium Differences**\n\nCompare and contrast the characteristics of spoken language and written language based on the text''s description of their distinct features.\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least three key differences between spoken and written language as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: For each difference, explain how it influences the way language is used in different mediums.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example of how a sentence might be structured differently in spoken versus written language to reflect these differences.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate the two mediums and demonstrate an understanding of how their characteristics affect communication.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Grammatical Registers**\n\nExamine the examples provided in the text to explain how grammatical variation reflects different communication registers.\n- **Part A**: Compare the formal and informal versions of the sentences: "comprehend and strive" vs. "understand and try"; "This is the student to whom I gave the message" vs. "Thus is the student I gave the message to."\n- **Part B**: Discuss how these variations in grammar contribute to the speaker''s or writer''s attitude towards the listener or reader.\n- **Part C**: Based on the reference to Biber et al.''s Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English, explain how the text''s discussion of registers aligns with or differs from their findings.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of grammatical variation and its role in communication registers.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Descriptive vs. Prescriptive Rules**\n\nThe text mentions descriptive rules and prescriptive rules in the context of language. Consider the following statements: \n- "The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson."\n- "The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson."\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain the difference between descriptive and prescriptive rules using examples from the text.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the two statements above to determine whether they are examples of descriptive or prescriptive rules. Justify your answer based on the text''s explanation of these concepts.\n- **Part C**: Construct a scenario where a descriptive rule might be used in language teaching, and explain how it differs from using a prescriptive rule.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly define the two types of rules and demonstrate an understanding of their application in language analysis and teaching.'

- prompt: |-
    At the beginning of this chapter I said that the rules of grammar state which combinations of words are possible in the language and which are not. My example of an impossible sentence in English was Home computers now much are cheaper. The rule that disallows that sentence is a descriptive rule, a rule that describes how people use their language. The validity of this descriptive rule depends on whether it is true that Home computers are now much cheaper is a possible English sentence and Home computers now much are cheaper is an impossible English sentence. The evidence to validate this rule is drawn from the knowledge that speakers of English have of their language as well as from samples of their actual use of the language. Of course the descriptive rule must be accurately formulated to make the valid distinctions.

    Sometimes people speaking the same dialect disagree in their evaluation of particular sentences. For example, some speakers of standard British English find acceptable I demand that she gives her reasons; others prefer or require a different form of the verb in the that-clause, either that she give her reasons or that she should give her reasons.

    A number of differences in the use of standard British English have acquired social importance. Some speakers of the standard dialect consider that certain usages mark their user as uneducated. Rules that specify which usages should be adopted or avoided are called prescriptive rules. Examples of prescriptive rules are:

    e Don't use the as a conjunction, as in He speaks like his father does.
    e Don't use between you and I.

    e Don't split an infinitive, as in to actually feel.

    e Don't end a sentence with a preposition.

    Speakers of the standard dialect tend to pay greater attention to prescriptive rules when they are on their best behaviour, in particular when they are writing in a formal style.

    1.8 Why study grammar?

    The study of language is a part of general knowledge. We study the complex working of the human body to understand ourselves; the same reason should attract us to studying the marvellous complexity of human language.

    Everybody has attitudes towards the English language and its varieties, and has opinions on specific features. These attitudes and opinions affect relationships

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Descriptive and Prescriptive Grammar Rules**\n\nExplain the distinction between descriptive and prescriptive grammar rules using examples from the text.\n- **Step 1**: Define each term with clear, concise language based on the text.\n- **Step 2**: Provide a specific example of each type of rule from the text (e.g., the ''Home computers now much are cheaper'' example for descriptive rules).\n- **Step 3**: Analyze why the validity of a prescriptive rule depends on social context, using examples from the text about British English usage.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly differentiate the two rule types and demonstrate an understanding of their social implications.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Grammar Rules in Language Use**\n\nThe text discusses how prescriptive rules can lead to social judgments about language use. Consider the example of ''I demand that she gives her reasons'' vs. ''I demand that she give her reasons''.\n- **Part A**: Explain why some speakers of British English find the first sentence unacceptable, referencing the prescriptive rule about verb form in that-clauses.\n- **Part B**: Evaluate whether this prescriptive rule is actually a ''rule of the language'' or merely an opinion. Support your answer with evidence from the text about descriptive rules and speaker variability.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how prescriptive rules might influence social attitudes toward language use, using examples from the text about ''uneducated'' usages.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both descriptive and prescriptive perspectives, showing an understanding of the tension between language use and social norms.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Grammar Knowledge**\n\nUsing the text''s definitions and examples, construct a scenario where prescriptive rules about grammar would lead to different interpretations of a sentence.\n- **Part A**: Create a sentence that is grammatically correct under one prescriptive rule but not under another.\n- **Part B**: Explain the reasoning behind each prescriptive rule, using examples from the text (e.g., ''Don''t split an infinitive'').\n- **Part C**: Analyze how the social importance of these rules might affect a person''s perception of themselves or others based on their language use.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your scenario must demonstrate an understanding of how different rules can lead to conflicting interpretations and the social implications of grammar usage.'

    with other people. If you understand the nature of language, you will realize the
    grounds for your linguistic prejudices and perhaps moderate them; you will also
    more clearly assess linguistic issues of public concern, such as worries about the
    state of the language or what to do about the teaching of immigrants. Studying the
    English language has a more obvious practical application: it can help you to use
    the language more effectively.

    In the study of language, grammar occupies a central position. But there is also
    a practical reason to emphasize the study of grammar. It is easy to learn to use
    dictionaries by yourself to find the pronunciation, spelling, or meanings of words,
    but it is difficult to consult grammar books without a considerable knowledge of
    grammar.

    There are several applications of grammatical study: (1) A recognition of gram-
    matical structures is often essential for punctuation; (2) A study of one's native
    grammar is helpful when one studies the grammar of a foreign language; (3) A
    knowledge of grammar is a help in the interpretation of literary as well as nonliterary
    texts, since the interpretation of a passage sometimes depends crucially on gram-
    matical analysis; (4) A study of the grammatical resources of English is useful in
    composition: in particular, it can help you to evaluate the choices available to you
    when you come to revise an earlier written draft.

    This book provides a survey of the grammar of standard British English, with sets
    of exercises at the end of each major section. It also includes applications to punc-
    tuation, usage problems, writing style, and the analysis of a range of linguistic registers.
    It ends with an appendix on spelling, and a glossary of terms used in the book.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Grammar''s Practical Role**\n\nUsing the text, explain how grammar contributes to effective language use in three distinct ways. Your answer must reference at least two of the applications listed in the passage (e.g., punctuation, literary interpretation) and provide a real-world example for each.\n- **Example 1**: Relate grammar to punctuation by explaining how grammatical structures influence the placement of commas.\n- **Example 2**: Connect grammar to literary interpretation by discussing how grammatical analysis can clarify ambiguities in complex texts.\n- **Example 3**: Describe how grammar aids in composition by evaluating the clarity of written drafts.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of grammar''s role and provide specific examples without referencing the text directly.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Grammar Learning Challenges**\n\nThe text states that it is difficult to consult grammar books without considerable knowledge of grammar. Explain how this creates a paradox in learning grammar, and propose two strategies to resolve it.\n- **Strategy 1**: Suggest a method for building grammar knowledge incrementally, using the text''s emphasis on practical applications.\n- **Strategy 2**: Propose a way to use real-world language exposure (e.g., reading, conversation) as a tool for understanding grammar.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must address the paradox and provide actionable strategies that align with the text''s argument about grammar''s practical role.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Thinking on Grammar and Language Use**\n\nThe text mentions that studying grammar helps assess linguistic issues of public concern, such as the state of the language or teaching immigrants. Critically evaluate this claim by: (1) Identifying two specific linguistic issues that grammar can inform, and (2) Discussing how grammatical analysis can influence policy or education.\n- **Issue 1**: Explain how grammar study can address concerns about language degradation or standardization.\n- **Issue 2**: Describe how understanding grammar can improve the teaching of English to non-native speakers.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must link grammar study to real-world linguistic issues and demonstrate an understanding of how grammatical knowledge impacts language policy and education.'

    Conditional clauses sometimes begin with an auxiliary and have no conjunction, as in Had I known, I would have telephoned you.

    The preposition but should be followed by an objective pronoun, as in nobody

    The most common way of expressing future meaning is with will.

    Adverbs such as very modify adjectives (e.g. very good) and other adverbs
    (e.g. very carefully).

    When you are writing formally, use the subjective pronoun after the verb be,

    The Grammar

    The Sentence

    2.1 What is a sentence?

    Grammar deals with the rules for combining words into larger units. The largest
    unit that is described in grammar is normally the sentence. However, defining a
    'sentence' is notoriously difficult, for the reasons we'll now discuss.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Grammar Rules and Usage\n\nCompose a grammatically correct sentence that incorporates the following elements:\n- A conditional clause beginning with ''Had I known'' (as in the example: ''Had I known, I would have telephoned you'')\n- An objective pronoun following the preposition ''but'' (as in ''nobody but me'')\n- A future meaning expressed with the verb ''will''\n- An adverb modifying an adjective (''very good'') and another adverb modifying a verb (''very carefully'')\n- A formal sentence using the subjective pronoun after the verb ''be'' (as in ''It was he who told me...'')\n\n**Task**: Ensure that all elements are integrated into a coherent, well-structured sentence. Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the specific grammar rules provided in the text, including the use of conditional clauses, prepositions with objective pronouns, future tense markers, and formal subject-verb agreement.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must be correct grammatically, and you must explicitly reference at least three distinct grammar rules from the text in your explanation.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Critical Analysis of Language Variation\n\nUsing the topics listed in Exercise 1.5 (e.g., ''Sexist language'', ''Euphemism'', ''Clichés''), construct a 200-word essay that analyzes the function and impact of language variation in English.\n- **Part A**: Define ''sexist language'' and provide a contemporary example from everyday usage\n- **Part B**: Explain how ''euphemism'' can be both effective and problematic in communication\n- **Part C**: Discuss the role of ''clichés'' in shaping public perception and their potential limitations\n\n**Task**: Your essay must integrate at least three of the listed topics, demonstrating an understanding of their linguistic characteristics and societal implications.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your essay must be coherent, well-structured, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the concepts from the text without relying on external references.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Logical Reasoning with Grammatical Structures\n\nConsider the following two sentences:\n1. It was he who told me the news.\n2. It was him who told me the news.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the first sentence is grammatically correct in formal writing, while the second is not. Reference the rule about using subjective pronouns after the verb ''be''\n- **Part B**: Construct a similar sentence using the conditional clause structure from the text (e.g., ''Had I known...'') and ensure it adheres to the grammatical rules provided\n- **Part C**: Analyze the difference between ''very good'' and ''very carefully'', explaining how adverbs modify different parts of speech based on the text''s explanation\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of grammatical structures, including pronoun usage, conditional clauses, and adverb modification as outlined in the text.'

    It is sometimes said that a sentence expresses a complete thought. This is a
    notional definition: it defines a term by the notion or idea it conveys. The diffi-
    culty with this definition lies in fixing what is meant by a ‘complete thought'.
    There are notices, for example, that seem to be complete in themselves but are not
    generally regarded as sentences: Exit, Danger, 50 mph speed limit.

    On the other hand, there are sentences that clearly consist of more than one
    thought. Here is one relatively simple example:

    This week marks the 300th anniversary of the publication of Sir Isaac
    Newton's Philosophiae Naturals Principia Mathematica, a fundamental
    work for the whole of modern science and a key influence on the philosophy
    of the European Enlightenment.

    How many ‘complete thoughts' are there in this sentence? We should at least
    recognize that the part after the comma introduces two additional points about
    Newton's book: (1) that it is a fundamental work for the whole of modern science,
    and (2) that it was a key influence on the philosophy of the European Enlighten-
    ment. Yet this example would be acknowledged by all as a single sentence, and it is
    written as a single sentence.

    We can try another approach by defining a sentence as a string of words begin-
    ning with a capital (upper case) letter and ending with a full stop (period). This is
    a formal definition: it defines a term by the form or shape of what the term refers
    to. We can at once see that as it stands this definition is inadequate, since (1) many
    sentences end with a question mark or an exclamation mark, and (2) capital letters
    are used for names, and full stops are often used in abbreviations. Even if we
    amend the definition to take account of these objections, we still find strings
    of words in newspaper headlines, titles, and notices that everyone would recognize
    as sentences even though they do not end with a full stop, a question mark, or an
    exclamation mark:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Complete Thoughts in a Sentence**\n\nConsider the sentence: \"This week marks the 300th anniversary of the publication of Sir Isaac Newton''s Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, a fundamental work for the whole of modern science and a key influence on the philosophy of the European Enlightenment.\"\n- **Part A**: Identify how many complete thoughts are expressed in this sentence based on the text''s discussion of ''complete thought.'' Justify your answer by analyzing the structure and content of the sentence.\n- **Part B**: Compare this with the example given in the text: \"Trees May Be a Source of Pollution\". How does the structure and purpose of this sentence relate to the concept of a ''complete thought''?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how sentences can be composed of multiple complete thoughts while still being considered a single sentence, as explained in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluating Sentence Structure Definitions**\n\nThe text presents two different approaches to defining a sentence: one based on content (complete thought) and another based on form (capital letter and full stop).\n- **Part A**: Critique the formal definition of a sentence as a string of words beginning with a capital letter and ending with a full stop. What are the limitations of this definition according to the text?\n- **Part B**: Analyze the example from the text: \"An Introduction to English Grammar\". How does this title challenge the formal definition of a sentence?\n- **Part C**: Propose an alternative definition that incorporates both content and form considerations. Explain how this definition would address the limitations of the formal definition while maintaining clarity.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate both content-based and form-based analyses, as discussed in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Applying Sentence Analysis to Real-World Examples**\n\nUse the text''s discussion of complete thoughts and sentence definitions to analyze the following examples:\n1. \"Do not enter\" (a notice)\n2. \"An Irish Airman Foresees his Death\" (a title)\n3. \"Trees May Be a Source of Pollution\" (a headline)\n- **Part A**: For each example, determine whether it qualifies as a sentence based on the text''s definitions.\n- **Part B**: Explain how each example demonstrates a different aspect of the text''s discussion on complete thoughts and sentence definitions.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s analysis helps in understanding the broader concept of language and communication.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate an understanding of the text''s key concepts and their application to these examples.'

    But the most serious objection is that the definition is directed only towards
    orthographic sentences; that is, sentences that appear in the written language.
    Spoken sentences, of course, do not have capital letters and full stops.

    It is in fact far more difficult to determine the limits of sentences in natural con-
    versation, to say where sentences begin and end. That is so partly because people
    may change direction as they speak and partly because they tend to make heavy use
    of connectors such as and, but, so, and then. Here is a typical example of a speaker
    who strings sentences together with and. The symbol <,> denotes a pause.

    I'd been working away this week trying to clear up <,> the backlog of
    mail caused by me being three weeks away <,> and I thought I was doing
    marvellously <,> and at about <,> six o'clock last night <,> I was sorting
    through <,> stuff on the desk and I discovered a fat pile of stuff <,> all
    carefully opened and documented by Sally that I hadn't even seen

    How many orthographic sentences correspond to the speaker's story? There is
    no one correct answer. In writing it we have a choice: we could punctuate it as one
    sentence or we could split it into two or more sentences, each of the later sentences
    beginning with and.

    Grammarians are not unduly worried about the difficulties in defining the sen-
    tence. Their approach to the question is formal because they are interested in
    grammatical form. Like many people who are not grammarians, they are generally
    confident of recognizing sentences, and they specify the possible patterns for the
    sentences. Combinations of words that conform to those patterns are then gram-
    matical sentences.

    2.2 Irregular sentences and non-sentences

    Sentences that conform to the major patterns (cf. 3.13) are regular sentences, and
    they are the type that will generally concern us in this book. Sentences that do not
    conform to the major patterns are irregular sentences.

    If I ask you to write down the first sentences that come into your mind, you are
    likely to produce regular sentences. Here are some regular sentences in various
    major patterns:

    David and Helen have three children.

    The liquid smelled spicy to Justin.

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Analyzing Sentence Boundaries in Spoken Discourse\n\nConsider the following spoken dialogue: \n\n"I''d been working away this week trying to clear up <,> the backlog of mail caused by me being three weeks away <,> and I thought I was doing marvellously <,> and at about <,> six o''clock last night <,> I was sorting through <,> stuff on the desk and I discovered a fat pile of stuff <,> all carefully opened and documented by Sally that I hadn''t even seen.\"\n\n**Task**: Determine how many orthographic sentences are represented in this spoken account. Explain your reasoning, and discuss the ambiguity in defining sentence boundaries in natural speech.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of the distinction between spoken and written sentences, as well as the role of punctuation in defining orthographic sentences.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Classifying Sentences Based on Grammar and Structure\n\nExplain the difference between regular sentences and irregular sentences as defined in the text. Provide two examples of each, citing specific grammatical patterns from the text.\n\n**Task**: \n- **Part A**: Define regular sentences and irregular sentences using the text''s terminology.\n- **Part B**: Give two examples of regular sentences, citing their grammatical patterns (e.g., subject-verb agreement).\n- **Part C**: Provide two examples of irregular sentences, explaining why they do not conform to the major patterns.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s definitions and demonstrate an understanding of grammatical structure.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Evaluating Grammatical Recognition and Formal Analysis\n\nThe text states that grammarians focus on formal patterns rather than the difficulties in defining sentences. Consider the following two statements: \n\n1. "Grammarians are not unduly worried about the difficulties in defining the sentence."\n2. "Like many people who are not grammarians, they are generally confident of recognizing sentences."\n\n**Task**: \n- **Part A**: Explain why grammarians might not be unduly worried about defining sentences, based on their formal approach.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the contrast between grammarians'' confidence and non-grammarians'' potential uncertainty in recognizing sentences.\n- **Part C**: Provide an example of a sentence that is grammatically correct but might be ambiguously understood by non-grammarians.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s perspective on grammatical form and recognition, demonstrating an understanding of both formal analysis and practical interpretation.'

    About a million visitors come to our city every summer.

    The Sentence 15

    Most irregular sentences are fragmentary sentences. These leave out words that
    we can easily supply, usually from the preceding verbal context. Here is a typical
    example in an exchange between two speakers:

    A: Where did you put the letter?
    B: In the top drawer.

    We interpret B's reply as I put the letter in the top drawer, and that reconstructed
    sentence would be regular. Similarly, the newspaper headline Washington abuzz
    over missing intern corresponds to the regular Washington is abuzz over a missing
    intern. Fragmentary sentences can therefore be viewed as directly derivable in their
    interpretation from regular sentences.

    Finally, we often say or write things that are not grammatical sentences. These
    non-sentences may simply be mistakes. But they may also be perfectly normal,
    although they cannot be analysed grammatically as sentences. Normal non-
    sentences include such common expressions as Hello!; Yes; No; So long!, Thanks!,
    Cheers!; and they include many headlines, headings, titles, labels and notices:

    Traffic Chaos (newspaper headline)

    On the Nature of the Model (section heading in book)
    The Captain and the Kings (title of book)

    Naming of Parts (title of poem)

    Pure Lemon Juice

    No Smoking

    In the next chapter we will be looking at the patterns of regular sentences, but first
    I have a few more general things to say about sentences.

    2.3 Simple and multiple sentences

    Here are two sentences placed next to each other:

    [1] The inquiry left in its wake a number of casualties. I was one of them.

    I can combine the two sentences in [1] merely by putting and between them:

    [2] The inquiry left in its wake a number of casualties, and I was one of them.
    I can also combine them by putting a connecting word in front of the first sentence:
    [3] When the inquiry left in its wake a number of casualties, I was one of them.

    I can make a small change in the second sentence:

    [4] The inquiry left in its wake a number of casualties, I being one of them.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Types and Interpretation**\n\nConsider the newspaper headline: ''Washington abuzz over missing intern'' from the text.\n- **Part A**: Explain how this fragmentary sentence can be interpreted as a complete, regular sentence. Use the example provided in the text (Washington is abuzz over a missing intern) to support your reasoning.\n- **Part B**: Compare the interpretation of fragmentary sentences in spoken language (e.g., ''Where did you put the letter? B: In the top drawer.'') with that in written language (e.g., newspaper headlines).\n- **Part C**: Create your own fragmentary sentence, similar to the headline example, and show how it can be interpreted as a complete sentence.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how fragmentary sentences are derived from regular ones and their use in different contexts.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Non-Sentences and Their Functions**\n\nExamine the expressions: ''Hello!'', ''Yes'', ''So long!'', and ''Cheers!'' as listed in the text.\n- **Part A**: Explain why these are considered non-sentences and not grammatical sentences. Use the text''s definition of non-sentences as ''things that are not grammatical sentences'' to justify your answer.\n- **Part B**: Compare the function of non-sentences in everyday conversation (e.g., ''Yes'', ''No'') with their function in written formats like newspaper headlines and book titles.\n- **Part C**: Create a non-sentence that could be used in a different context (e.g., a movie title or a label on a product) and explain its purpose.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between grammatical sentences and non-sentences as defined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Integration of Sentence Structure and Coherence**\n\nConsider the following sentences from the text: [1] The inquiry left in its wake a number of casualties. I was one of them.\n- **Part A**: Explain how these two sentences can be combined into a single, coherent sentence using ''and'' as shown in [2].\n- **Part B**: Discuss the difference between combining sentences with a conjunction (e.g., ''and'') versus using a subordinating conjunction (e.g., ''When'' in [3]).\n- **Part C**: Modify the sentence [4] to make it a complete, grammatical sentence by adjusting punctuation or word order.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of sentence structure, coherence, and the use of conjunctions in English grammar.'

    A sentence or a sentence-like construction contained within a sentence is called
    a clause. Constructions like J being one of them in [4] resemble sentences in that
    they can be analysed to a large extent in similar ways (cf. 6.8). The sentences in [2],
    [3], and [4] therefore all consist of two clauses. (Strictly speaking, the separate
    sentences in [1] are also clauses, but since they have only one clause each, it is
    convenient to refer to them just as sentences.)

    A sentence that does not contain another clause within it is a simple sentence.
    If it contains one or more clauses, it is a multiple sentence.

    Here are some more examples of multiple sentences with connecting words:

    You can't insist that your children love each other.

    The building was emptied before the bomb-disposal squad was called.

    When we returned three hours later, no wolves were in sight.

    1. Declaratives (or declarative sentences)
    She was attracted to an open-air job.
    The new proposals have galvanized the normally disparate community into a
    potent fighting force.

    2. Interrogatives (or interrogative sentences)
    Do you have internet access at home?
    Where will you be going for your holiday?

    3. Imperatives (or imperative sentences)
    Open the door for me.
    Take a seat.

    4. Exclamatives (or exclamative sentences)

    How well you look!
    What a good friend you are!

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Classification of Sentence Types**\n\nClassify the following sentences as declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamative based on their structure and function:\n1. "The new proposals have galvanized the normally disparate community into a potent fighting force."\n2. "Where will you be going for your holiday?"\n3. "Take a seat, please."\n4. "What a good friend you are!"\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly identify the type of each sentence and justify your classification using the definitions provided in the text. You must reference the four major types of sentences described (declaratives, interrogatives, imperatives, exclamatives) and explain why each sentence fits into its designated category.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Multiple Sentences**\n\nExamine the following sentences and identify the type of sentence (simple or multiple) they are, as well as the number of clauses each contains:\n1. "You can''t insist that your children love each other."\n2. "When we returned three hours later, no wolves were in sight."\n3. "My father always hoped that I would become a doctor and that must have been why he took me along when he visited his patients."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must specify for each sentence whether it is simple or multiple, and the number of clauses. You must also explain how the presence or absence of connecting words affects the classification, as described in the text. You must refer to the definitions of simple and multiple sentences provided in the text, as well as the role of clauses within these structures.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structure**\n\nConstruct a sentence that demonstrates each of the four major types of sentences (declarative, interrogative, imperative, exclamative) using the given words: "The sun is shining", "Please help me", "How beautiful!", and "Did you finish your homework?"\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include one example of each sentence type, using the provided words. For each sentence, you must explain how it fits into its designated category based on the text''s definitions. You must also analyze how the sentence structure and function align with the characteristics of each type, ensuring that your examples are both grammatically correct and semantically appropriate.  '

    We will be discussing these sentence types and their uses in a later chapter
    (cf. 6.1-5). Declaratives are the basic type and I will therefore generally be using
    them for illustrative purposes.

    2.5 Positive and negative sentences

    Sentences are either positive or negative. If an auxiliary ('helping') verb is
    present, we can usually change a positive sentence into a negative sentence by
    inserting not or n't after the auxiliary. In the following examples, the auxiliaries are
    has, is, and can:

    Positive: | Nancy has been working here for over a year.
    Negative: Nancy has not been working here for over a year.

    Positive: | Dan is paying for the meal.
    Negative: Dan isn't paying for the meal.

    Positive: | I can tell the difference.
    Negative: | I can't tell the difference.

    The rules for inserting not and n't are somewhat complicated. I will return to them
    later (cf. 3.3f).

    A sentence may be negative because of some other negative word:

    She never had a secretary.
    Nobody talked to us.
    This is such an ordinary painting.

    Most sentences are positive, and I will therefore generally be using positive
    sentences for my examples.

    2.6 Active and passive sentences

    Sentences are either active or passive. We can often choose whether to make a
    sentence active or passive (cf. 4.15). The choice involves differences in position
    and differences in the form of the verb:

    Active: | Charles Dickens wrote many novels.
    Passive: Many novels were written by Charles Dickens.

    Charles Dickens and many novels are at opposite ends of the two sentences. In the
    passive sentence by comes before Charles Dickens, and the active wrote corresponds
    to the longer were written.

    Here are two further examples of pairs of active and passive sentences:

    Active: | Manchester United beat Liverpool at Old Trafford.
    Passive: Liverpool were beaten by Manchester United at Old Trafford.

    Active: | The Rambert Dance Company won the country's largest arts
    prize, the Prudential Award.

    Passive: The country's largest arts prize, the Prudential Award, was
    won by the Rambert Dance Company.

    Actives are far more numerous than passives. Their relative frequency varies with
    register. For example, passives tend to be heavily used in formal scientific writing.

- prompt: |-
    [1] A heavy snowfall has blocked the mountain passes.

    There are various ways of analysing this. One way is to say that the sentence
    contains three units:

    A heavy snowfall
    has blocked
    the mountain passes

    We cannot simply arrange the units in any way that we like. For example, [1a] below
    is not an English sentence:

    [la] Has blocked the mountain passes a heavy snowfall.

    Sentence [1] has a structure in that there are rules that decide the units that can
    co-occur in the sentence and the order in which they can occur.

    The three units in [1] are phrases. Phrases also have a structure. We cannot
    rearrange the internal order of the three phrases in [1]. These are not English
    phrases: heavy snowfall a, blocked has, the passes mountain.

    A heavy snowfall and the mountain passes are noun phrases (cf. 4.2) and has
    blocked is a verb phrase (cf. 4.11). We characterize them as these types of phrases
    because of their structure: in the noun phrases a noun is the main word, while in
    the verb phrase a verb is the main word. That kind of characterization describes
    the type of structure for each of the three units.

    We can also look at the three units from a different point of view; their func-
    tion, or how they are used in a particular sentence. For example, in [1] 4 heavy
    snowfall is the subject of the sentence and the mountain passes is the direct object
    of the sentence (cf. 3.5—7):
    The Parts of the Simple Sentence 21
    [1] A heavy snowfall has blocked the mountain passes.

    However, in [2] below a heavy snowfall is the direct object and in [3] the mountain
    passes is the subject:

    [2] They encountered a heavy snowfall.
    [3] The mountain passes are now open.

    We therefore see that identical phrases may have different functions in different
    sentences.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Phrase Structure and Function**\n\nAnalyze the sentence [1] ''A heavy snowfall has blocked the mountain passes'' by identifying:\n- **Part A**: The three units (phrases) and their types (noun phrase, verb phrase).\n- **Part B**: The grammatical functions of each unit (subject, object, etc.).\n- **Part C**: Explain why rearranging the units within the sentence cannot produce a grammatically correct English sentence. Use the text''s discussion on phrase structure and co-occurrence rules to justify your answer.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text''s definitions of noun and verb phrases, as well as the rules governing phrase order in English sentences.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Functional Flexibility of Phrases**\n\nCompare the functions of the noun phrase ''a heavy snowfall'' in sentences [1], [2], and [3]:\n- **Part A**: Identify the grammatical role (subject, object) in each sentence.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the same phrase can function differently based on context, citing the text''s discussion on sentence structure and functional roles.\n- **Part C**: Create an original example using a different phrase (e.g., ''the approaching storm'') that demonstrates this flexibility. Justify your example using the text''s principles of phrase function and sentence structure.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how phrase function varies across sentences and the logical reasoning behind this variation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Analysis of Phrase Co-occurrence**\n\nExamine the sentence [1] and explain why certain phrase combinations are grammatically valid while others are not:\n- **Part A**: List two examples of valid phrase combinations from the text and explain why they are correct.\n- **Part B**: Construct an example of an invalid phrase combination (e.g., ''blocked has the mountain passes a heavy snowfall'') and explain why it violates the rules of English grammar.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of these co-occurrence rules for understanding sentence structure. How do they reflect the underlying principles of English grammar as discussed in the text?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of phrase structure, co-occurrence rules, and grammatical validity as presented in the text.'

- prompt: |-
    Turning back to [1], we can combine the descriptions by structure and function.
    A heavy snowfall is a noun phrase functioning as subject, and the mountain passes 1s
    a noun phrase functioning as direct object. In this chapter we will be examining
    the function of the phrases, not their structure. In the next section, we will take a
    preliminary look at the functions of the parts of a sentence.

    3.2 Subject, predicate, verb

    It is traditional to divide the sentence into two main constituents: the subject and
    the predicate. The predicate consists of the verb and any other elements of the
    sentence apart from the subject:

    subject predicate

    I learned all this much later.

    The chef is a young man with broad experience of the
    world.

    The fate of the land parallels the fate of the culture.

    The most important constituent of the predicate is the verb. Indeed, it is the most
    important constituent in the sentence, since regular sentences may consist of only
    a verb: imperatives such as Help! and Look! The verb of the sentence may consist
    of more than one word: could have been imagining. The main verb in this verb
    phrase comes last: imagining. The verbs that come before the main verb are
    auxiliary verbs (‘helping verbs'), or simply auxiliaries: could have been.

    I have been following traditional practice in using the word verb in two senses:

    1. Like the subject, the verb is a constituent of sentence structure. In [1] the verb
    of the sentence is stroked and in [2] it is has been working:

    [1] Anthony stroked his beard.
    [2] Ellen has been working all day.

    2. A verb is a word, just as a noun is a word. In this sense, [2] contains three
    verbs: the auxiliaries has and been and the main verb working. The three verbs
    in [2] form a unit, the unit being a verb phrase (cf. 4.11).

    3.3 Operator

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structure and Function**\n\nAnalyze the sentence ''A heavy snowfall is a noun phrase functioning as subject, and the mountain passes are a noun phrase functioning as direct object.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the subject and predicate of each clause.\n- **Step 2**: Explain the function of the noun phrases in the sentence, referencing the text''s emphasis on ''function over structure.''\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the text focuses on functions rather than structures when examining sentence constituents.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the distinction between structure and function, as outlined in the text.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Verb Phrases**\n\nExamine the verb phrase ''could have been imagining'' from the text.\n- **Part A**: Determine the main verb and auxiliary verbs in this phrase, using the text''s definitions of ''auxiliary verbs'' (helping verbs).\n- **Part B**: Compare the verb phrase in [1] (''Anthony stroked his beard'') with [2] (''Ellen has been working all day''). Explain how the text differentiates between a single verb and a verb phrase.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of the text''s two definitions of ''verb'' (as a sentence constituent and as a word).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both definitions of ''verb'' and demonstrate understanding of how verb phrases function in sentences.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Reasoning on Sentence Constituents**\n\nConstruct a sentence that includes both a subject and predicate, using the text''s terminology.\n- **Part A**: Identify the subject and predicate of your sentence, using the text''s definitions.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the verb phrase in your sentence functions, referencing the text''s discussion on auxiliary verbs and main verbs.\n- **Part C**: Justify why the text emphasizes studying functions over structures when examining sentence constituents.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s key concepts and show creative application of its terminology.'

- prompt: |-
    In section 3.2 I divided the sentence into two parts: the subject and the predicate.
    I then pointed to the verb as the most important constituent of the predicate.
    We can now identify an element in the verb that has important functions in the
    sentence: the operator. Another way of analysing the sentence is to say that it
    consists of three constituents: the subject, the operator, and the rest of the predicate.
    As a first approximation, I will say that the operator is the first or only auxiliary
    in the verb of the sentence. In [1] the verb is could have been imagining:

    [1] You could have been imagining tt.

    The operator is could, the first auxiliary. In [2] the verb is can get:
    [2] Karen can get to the heart of a problem.

    The operator is can, the only auxiliary.

    The operator plays an essential role in the formation of certain sentence structures:

    1. We form most types of questions by interchanging the positions of the subject
    and the operator:

    [1] You could have been imagining it.
    [la] Could you have been imagining it?

    This is known as subject-operator inversion.

    2. We form negative sentences by putting zor after the operator. In informal
    style, mot is often contracted to "'t, and in writing v't is attached to the
    operator; some operators have very different positive and negative forms (e.g.

    will in [4] and won't in [4a]):

    [3] Barbara and Charles are getting married in April.

    [3a] Barbara and Charles { ar met | getting married in April.
    [4] Nancy will be staying with us.

    will not

    [4a] ancy { won't } be staying with us

    3. Operators can carry the stress in speech to convey certain kinds of emphasis:

    [5] A: Finish your homework.
    B: I HAVE finished it.

    [6] A: Iam afraid to tell my parents.
    B: You MUST tell them.

    4. Operators are used in various kinds of reduced clauses to substitute for the
    predicate:
    The Parts of the Simple Sentence 23

    [7] A: Are you leaving?

    B: Yes, I am.
    [8] Karen and Tom haven't seen the video, but Jill das.
    [9] [ll take one if you will.

    3.4 Do, Be, Have

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Subject-Operator Inversion**\n\nUsing the concept of subject-operator inversion explained in the text, rewrite the sentence ''The teacher is explaining the lesson'' into a question.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the subject and operator in the original sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the rule of subject-operator inversion to form a question.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your answer by referencing the text''s explanation of how this inversion is used to form questions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your question must be grammatically correct and explicitly reference the operator''s role in sentence structure as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Negation and Operator Forms**\n\nConsider the sentence ''Nancy will be staying with us.''\n- **Part A**: According to the text, what is the operator in this sentence?\n- **Part B**: Create a negative version of the sentence using the negation rule described in the text.\n- **Part C**: Explain why the operator ''will'' has a different negative form (''won''t'') compared to other operators like ''be'' (e.g., ''isn''t'' vs. ''am not'').\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of how operators function in both positive and negative sentence structures as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Operator Stress and Reduced Clauses**\n\nThe text discusses how operators can carry stress in speech to convey emphasis and are used in reduced clauses.\n- **Part A**: Explain how stress on the operator in sentence [5] (''I HAVE finished it'') emphasizes the completion of the task.\n- **Part B**: Analyze sentence [9] (''ll take one if you will'') and identify how the operator ''will'' functions in this reduced clause.\n- **Part C**: Construct a reduced clause using the operator ''have'' that conveys a conditional meaning, similar to sentence [9].\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s explanation of operator stress and reduced clauses to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of their grammatical roles.'

- prompt: |-
    In 3.3 I identified the operator as the first or only auxiliary. But many sentences
    have no auxiliary, as in [1]:

    [1] Terry works for a public authority.

    Here there is only the main verb works. If we want to form the structures specified
    in 3.3, we have to introduce the dummy operator do with the appropriate

    endings (do, does, did):

    [la] Does Terry work for a public authority?
    [1b] Terry doesn't work for a public authority.
    [1c] Terry does work for a public authority, and her sister does too.

    The auxiliary do in these sentences is a dummy operator because it is introduced to
    perform the functions of an operator in the absence of ‘true' operators such as can
    and will.

    There are two operators that are not auxiliaries. The verb be is used as an
    operator even when it is the main verb, provided that it is the only verb:

    [2] It was an awful system.
    [2a] Was it an awful system?

    Under the same condition, the main verb ave is optionally used as an operator:

    [3] Nora Aas just one daughter.
    [3a] Has Nora just one daughter?

    But with /ave there is a choice. We can introduce the dummy operator as with
    other verbs (Does Nora have just one daughter?) or substitute get as the main verb
    (Has Nora got just one daughter?).

    3.5 Subject and verb

    Regular sentences consist of a subject and a predicate, and the predicate contains
    at least a verb (cf. 3.2). Here are some sentences consisting of just the subject and
    the verb:
    24

    An Introduction to English Grammar

    A door opened.

    The sun is setting.

    The baby was crying.

    You must leave.

    Many of us have protested.
    They have been drinking.

    Sentences usually contain more than just the subject and the verb. Here are
    several examples, with the subject (S) and the verb (V) italicized and labelled:

    is black boots (S) had (V) pointed toes and fancy stitching.
    It (S) rained (V) every day of our vacation.

    Sometimes, a word or phrase comes between the subject and the verb:
    They (S) often stay (V) with us at weekends.

    Or there is an interruption between parts of the verb:
    We (S) can (V) never thank (V) this country enough.

    The easiest way to identify the subject in a declarative sentence is to turn this
    sentence into a yes—no question (one expecting the answer yes or no). The operator
    (op) and the subject change places:

    [1] The baby (S) has (op) been crying.

    [1a] Has (op) the baby (S) been crying?

    [2] Every kind of medical equipment (S) was (op) in short supply.

    [2a] Was (op) every kind of medical equipment (S) in short supply?

    [3] Eventually the managing director (S) intervened in the dispute.

    [3a] Did (op) the managing director (S) eventually intervene in the dispute?

    It may be necessary to turn other types of sentences into declarative sentences to
    identify the subject for this test and the next test. For example, the subject in [1a]
    is that part of the sentence that changes place with the operator when the question
    is turned into a declarative sentence.
    The Parts of the Simple Sentence

    Another way of identifying the subject of a declarative sentence is by asking
    a question introduced by who or what followed by the verb (without subject—
    operator inversion). The subject is the constituent that who or what questions:

    [4] Mr Bush (S) talked (V) by telephone with President Jiang Zemin of China.
    [4a] Who (S) talked (V) by telephone with President Jiang Zemin of China?

    — Mr Bush.
    [5] Tourism (S) has become (V) the fastest growing industry in our country.
    [5a] What (S) has become (V) the fastest growing industry in our country?

    — Tourism.

    We can identify the verb of the sentence because it changes its form or contains
    auxiliaries to express differences in time (for example, past and present) or attitude
    (for example, possibility, permission, and obligation). Here are some examples
    with the verb predict:

    We could use any of these forms of predict as the verb in this sentence:

    He predicted (V) another world recession.

    3.6 Subject

    Many grammatical rules refer to the subject. Here are some examples, including
    several that I have mentioned earlier:

    1. There are rules for the position of the subject. The subject normally comes
    before the verb in declaratives, but in questions it comes after the operator:

    [1] They (S) accepted (V) full responsibility.
    [la] Did (op) they (S) accept (V) full responsibility?

    The subject comes before the verb even in questions if who or what or an
    interrogative phrase such as which person is the subject:

    [lb] Who (S) accepted (V) full responsibility?
    2. The subject is normally absent in imperatives:
    Help (V) me with the luggage.

    3. Most verbs in the present have a distinctive form ending in -s when the
    subject is singular and refers to something or someone other than the speaker
    or the person or persons being addressed:

    The older child (singular S) feeds (singular V) the younger ones.

    The older children (plural S) feed (plural V) the younger ones.

    The senator (singular S) has (singular V) a clear moral position on racial
    equality.

    The senators (plural S) have (plural V) a clear moral position on racial
    equality.

    4. Some pronouns (words like I, you, she, he, they) have a distinctive form when
    they function as subject of the sentence or of clauses in the sentence:

    She (S) knows me well.
    I (S) know her well, and they (S) know her well too.

    5. The subject determines the form of reflexive pronouns (those ending in
    -self, such as herself, ourselves, themselves) that appear in the same clause:

    I (S) hurt myself badly.

    The child cried when he (S) hurt himself badly.
    You (S) can look at yoursel/fin the mirror.

    She (S) can look at herself in the mirror.

    6. When we turn an active sentence into a passive sentence (cf. 2.6) we change
    the subjects:

The term ‘transitive' comes from the notion that a person (represented by\nthe subject of the sentence) performs an action that affects some person or thing:\nthere is a ‘transition' of the action from the one to the other. Indeed, the direct\nobject (dO) typically refers to a person or thing directly affected by the action\ndescribed in the sentence:\n\nHelen received my email (dO).\n\nThey ate all the strawberries (dO).\n\nI dusted the bookshelves in my bedroom (dQ).\nAnthony stroked /us beard (dO).\n\nOne way of identifying the direct object in a declarative sentence is by asking a\nquestion introduced by who or what followed by the operator and the subject.

The direct object normally comes after the verb (but cf. 3.11).\nCarter has been photographing (V) light bulbs (dO) lately.\n\n2. Some pronouns have a distinctive form when they function as direct object\n\n(cf. 3.6 (4)):\n\nShe phoned us (dO) earlier this evening.\nWe phoned her (dO) earlier this evening.\n\nThe text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson."

Construct a sentence using ''them'' as a direct object, and explain why this pronoun is appropriate in that context.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion on pronoun forms and transitive verbs, demonstrating logical reasoning about their grammatical roles.'

- prompt: |-
    3. If the subject and direct object refer to the same person or thing, the direct
    object is a reflexive pronoun (cf. 3.6(5)):

    The children hid themselves.

    4. When we turn an active sentence into a passive sentence, the direct object of
    the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence:

    Active: The tests revealed traces of anthrax (dO).
    Passive: Traces of anthrax (S) were revealed by the tests.

    In this section I have discussed one basic sentence structure:
    SVO: — subject + (transitive) verb + (direct) object

    3.8 Linking verbs and subject complement

    If a verb requires a subject complement (sC) to complete the sentence, the verb is
    a linking verb. The subject complement (underlined in the examples that follow)
    typically identifies or characterizes the person or thing denoted by the subject:

    [1] Sandra is my mother's name,
    [2] Your room must be the one next to mine.
    [3] The upstairs tenant seemed a reliable person.

    [4] A university is a community of scholars.

    28

    An Introduction to English Grammar

    [5] The receptionist seemed very tired.

    [6] You should be more careful.
    [7] The distinction became quite clear.
    [8] The corridor is too narrow.

    The most common linking verb is be. Other common linking verbs (with examples
    of subject complements in parentheses) include appear (the best plan), become (my
    neighbour), seem (obvious), feel (foolish), get (ready), look (cheerful), sound (strange).
    Subject complements are typically noun phrases (cf. 4.2), as in [1]-{4] above, or
    adjective phrases (cf. 4.21), as in [5]-[8] above.

    We have now looked at two basic sentence structures:

    (3.7) SVO: subject + (transitive) verb + (direct) object
    (3.8) SVC: subject + (linking) verb + (subject) complement

    3.9 Intransitive verbs and adverbials

    If a main verb does not require another element to complete it, the verb is
    intransitive:

    [1] I (S) agree (V).

    [2] No cure (S) exists (V).

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Sentence Structures\n\nConsider the following sentences: \n\n1. The children hid themselves. \n2. Traces of anthrax were revealed by the tests. \n3. Sandra is my mother''s name. \n4. The corridor is too narrow.\n\n**Task**: Analyze each sentence to determine which of the basic structures it follows (SVO, SVC, or passive voice). For each sentence, explain your reasoning by referencing the grammatical rules provided in the text (e.g., ''Sentence 2 is a passive voice construction because...'').\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must explicitly identify the structure for each sentence and justify it using at least two specific rules from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Linking Verbs and Subject Complements\n\nConstruct a sentence using the linking verb ''seem'' that correctly incorporates a subject complement. Your sentence must: \n- Include at least one noun phrase and one adjective phrase as subject complements (as shown in examples 5-8 of the text). \n- Demonstrate an understanding of how linking verbs function to describe or characterize the subject.\n\n**Task**: \n- First, choose a subject (e.g., ''The results''). \n- Then, select a noun phrase and an adjective phrase that logically describe the subject. \n- Construct two sentences: one with a noun phrase as the complement, and one with an adjective phrase. \n- Explain how each sentence adheres to the rules of linking verbs as outlined in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentences must be grammatically correct and clearly demonstrate the use of linking verbs to characterize the subject.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Intransitive Verbs and Adverbials\n\nAnalyze the following sentences to determine if the main verb is intransitive and identify any adverbials: \n\n1. I agree. \n2. No cure exists. \n3. The tests revealed traces of anthrax.\n\n**Task**: For each sentence, answer the following: \n- Is the main verb intransitive? Explain your reasoning using the definition provided in the text. \n- If it is transitive, identify the direct object. \n- If there are adverbials, list them and explain their function (e.g., ''too narrow'' in sentence 4).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must clearly differentiate between intransitive and transitive verbs, and correctly identify any adverbials present in the sentences.'

- prompt: "[3] They (S) are lying (V).\n\n[4] The protestors (S) were demonstrating (V).\n\nWe have now seen three basic sentence structures:\n\n(3.7) SVO: subject + (transitive) verb + (direct) object  \n(3.8) SVC: — subject + (linking) verb + (subject) complement  \n(3.9) SV: subject + (intransitive) verb  \n\nThe structures are basic because we can always add optional elements to them.  \nThese optional elements are adverbials. Adverbials (A) convey a range of information about the situation depicted in the basic structure (cf. 3.14). In [la] below, the adverbial noisily depicts the manner of the action, and the adverbial outside the White House indicates the place of the action:\n\n[la] The protestors were demonstrating noisily (A) outside the White House (A).\n\nAs [la] indicates, a sentence may have more than one adverbial.  \nIn [2a] entirely is an intensifier of agree, conveying the intensity of the agreeing:\n\n[2a] I entirely (A) agree.\n\nThe Parts of the Simple Sentence 29  \nIn [3a] unfortunately supplies the writer's comment:  \n[3a] Unfortunately (A), no cure exists.\n\nIn [4a] therefore points to a logical connection between the two sentences.

Therefore (A) they are lying.\n\nThe sentences [la]—[4a] with adverbials have the basic structure SV, which we  \nalso see in the parallel sentences [1]-[4] without adverbials.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structures and Adverbials**\n\nConstruct a sentence that includes both an SVO and an SVC structure, using the adverbial ''however'' in both instances. Ensure that the sentence demonstrates how adverbials can modify different parts of the sentence and convey contrasting information.\n- **Part A**: Write the sentence.\n- **Part B**: Identify the basic structure of each clause (SVO, SVC, or SV) and explain how the adverbial ''however'' functions in each.\n- **Part C**: Justify why the use of the same adverbial in different clauses is acceptable despite its contrasting meaning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of sentence structures and the role of adverbials in modifying different components of a sentence.'

- prompt: |-
    We should be careful to distinguish adverbials from adverbs (cf. 5.15). The
    adverbial, like the subject, is a sentence constituent; the adverb, like the noun, is a
    word.

    3.10 Adverbial complement

    I explained in section 3.9 that adverbials are optional elements in sentence struc-
    ture. However, some elements that convey the same information as adverbials are
    obligatory because the main verb is not complete without them. Such obligatory
    elements are adverbial complements (aC).

    Contrast [1] with [1a]:

    [1] The protestors were demonstrating outside the White House (A).
    [la] The protestors were outside the White House (aC).

    In [1] the sentence is complete without the adverbial, but in [la] the sentence is
    not complete without the adverbial complement.
    Typically, adverbial complements refer to space, that is, location or direction:

    The city lies 225 miles north of Guatemala City (aC).

    The nearest inhabitants are a five-day mule trip away (aC).
    George is getting into his wife's car (aC).

    This road goes to Madison (aC).

    30 =An Introduction to English Grammar
    Adverbial complements may convey other meanings:

    Their work is in the early stages (aC).
    The show will last for three hours (aC).
    The children were with their mother (aC).
    These letters are for Cindy (aC).

    We can now add a fourth basic sentence structure to our set:

    (3.7) SVO: subject + (transitive) verb + (direct) object

    (3.8) SVC: subject + (linking) verb + (subject) complement
    (3.9) SV: subject + (intransitive) verb

    (3.10) SVA: subject + verb + adverbial (complement)

    The most common verb in the SVA structure is Je.

    3.11 Direct object and indirect object

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Adverbial Complement Function**\n\nCompare the sentences [1] and [la] from the text: ''\nThe protestors were demonstrating outside the White House (A).\n[la] The protestors were outside the White House (aC).\n\n**Task**: Explain how the adverbial complement in [la] is essential to the sentence''s completion, while the adverbial in [1] is optional.\n- **Step 1**: Define the difference between an adverbial and an adverbial complement based on the text.\n- **Step 2**: Apply this distinction to both sentences, providing examples from the text.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the adverbial complement is necessary for [la] but not for [1], using grammatical terminology from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between adverbials and adverbial complements, referencing the text''s examples.\n\n'

- prompt: |-
    We have seen that a transitive verb requires a direct object to complete the sentence (cf. 3.7). Some transitive verbs can have two objects: an indirect object followed by a direct object. The indirect object (iO) refers to a person indirectly affected by the action described in the sentence. The person generally receives something or benefits from something:

    [1] Ruth gave my son (iO) a birthday present (dO).

    [2] I can show you (iO) my diploma (dO).

    [3] My friends will save her (iO) a seat (dO).

    [4] You may ask the speaker (iO) another question (dO).

    The indirect object is usually equivalent to a phrase introduced by to or for, but that phrase normally comes after the direct object. Sentences [1a]—[4a] parallel

    [1a-4a]:

    [la] Ruth gave a birthday present to my son.

    [2a] I can show my diploma to you.

    [3a] My friends will save a seat for her.

    [4a] You may ask another question of the speaker.

    The structures in [1]—[4] and those in [la]-[4a] differ somewhat in their use, since there is a general tendency for the more important information to come at the end (cf. 9.2). For example, if the son has already been mentioned, but not the birthday present, we would expect [1] to be used rather than [la], though in speech we can indicate the focus of information by giving it prominence in our intonation.

    The Parts of the Simple Sentence

    We can question the indirect object in a way similar to the questioning of the direct object:

    [1b] Who (iO) did Ruth give a birthday present to?

    The grammatical rules that refer to the direct object (cf. 3.7) also refer to the indirect object:

    1. The indirect object comes after the verb:
    Ruth gave my son (iO) a birthday present (dO).

    Notice that the indirect object comes before the direct object.
    2. Some pronouns have a distinctive form when they function as indirect object:

    I paid her (iO) the full amount.
    She paid me (iO) the full amount.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Sentence Structure with Indirect Objects**\n\nConsider the sentence: *The teacher gave the students a quiz.*\n- **Part A**: Identify the direct object (dO) and indirect object (iO) in this sentence.\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the sentence using the structure where the indirect object phrase comes after the direct object, as in [1a] above.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the placement of the indirect object affects the emphasis in speech, using examples from [1] and [1a].\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly identify the objects, demonstrate correct sentence restructuring, and link placement to spoken emphasis as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Grammatical Rules and Pronoun Forms**\n\nCompare the sentences: *I paid her the full amount* and *She paid me the full amount*.\n- **Part A**: Identify the indirect object in each sentence and explain why these pronouns (her, me) are used as indirect objects.\n- **Part B**: Construct a sentence where the indirect object is a noun, not a pronoun.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the grammatical rules for indirect objects (as described in the text) relate to the concept of ''focus of information'' mentioned in [9.2].\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clarify the role of pronouns, provide an original example, and connect grammar to information focus.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Sentence Construction**\n\nUsing the rules provided in the text, construct a sentence that includes both an indirect object and a direct object.\n- **Part A**: Identify the indirect object and direct object in your sentence.\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the sentence using the ''to'' structure, as in [1a].\n- **Part C**: Analyze how the placement of the indirect object in your original sentence affects the interpretation of the sentence compared to its rewritten version.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of both structures, identify the objects, and explain their interpretive differences based on text information.'

- prompt: |-
    3. If the subject and indirect object refer to the same person, the indirect object is generally a reflexive pronoun (cf. 3.6(5)):

    The managing director paid herself (iO) a huge salary.

    4. When we turn an active sentence into a passive sentence, the indirect object of the active sentence can become the subject of the passive sentence:

    The principal granted Tony (iO) an interview.
    Tony (S) was granted an interview.

    The direct object can also become the subject, but in that case the indirect object (if retained) is generally represented by a phrase introduced by to or for:

    An interview was granted to Tony.

    We can now add a fifth basic sentence structure:

    (3.7) SVO: subject + (transitive) verb + (direct) object

    (3.8) SVC: subject + (linking) verb + (subject) complement

    (3.9) SV: subject + (intransitive) verb

    (3.10) SVA: subject + verb + adverbial (complement)

    (3.11) SVOO: subject + (transitive) verb + (indirect) object + (direct) object

    3.12 Direct object and object complement

    In 3.11 we have seen examples of transitive verbs that require two constituents: an indirect object and a direct object. In this section I introduce the two remaining structures, each of which consists of a subject, a transitive verb, a direct object, and a complement. In both structures the complement is related to the direct object.

    32 An Introduction to English Grammar

    In the first structure, the direct object is followed by an object complement (oC):

    [1] His jokes made the audience (dO) uneasy (oC).
    [2] I declared the meeting (dO) open (oC).

    [3] The heat has turned the milk (dO) sour (oC).
    [4] They elected her (dO) their leader (oC).

    This SVOC structure parallels the SVC structure (cf. 3.8), but in the first structure the complement is related to the direct object and in the second it is related to the subject. Compare [1]—[4] with [la]}-[4a]:

    The meanings of the sentence elements

    sentence elements are grammatical, not semantic, categories. However, they
    are associated with certain meanings. In this section I will illustrate some typical
    meanings.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structures**\n\nUsing the sentence structures provided in the text, construct a grammatically correct sentence that fits the following pattern: SVOO (subject + transitive verb + direct object + adverbial complement).\n- **Step 1**: Choose a subject (S) that is a common noun or pronoun.\n- **Step 2**: Select a transitive verb (V) that is commonly used with an adverbial complement.\n- **Step 3**: Identify a direct object (dO) that is a concrete noun.\n- **Step 4**: Add an adverbial complement (aC) that modifies the verb.\n- **Step 5**: Justify your choice of sentence structure by referencing the examples provided in the text (e.g., ''The example "You can put your coat in my bedroom" demonstrates...'').\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must be grammatically correct and follow the specified structure. You must explicitly reference at least one example from the text to support your reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Sentence Meaning**\n\nCompare the following two sentences using the meanings of sentence elements as discussed in the text:\n1. The children are growing hungry.\n2. The children are eating hamburgers.\n- **Part A**: Analyze the semantic implications of each sentence using the text''s explanation of subject (S), verb (V), and complement (C) meanings.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the first sentence ("The children are growing hungry") is considered a SVC structure, while the second ("The children are eating hamburgers") is an SVO structure.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the text''s distinction between grammatical categories (SVC vs. SVO) and semantic meanings influences understanding of sentence structure in English.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate the text''s discussion on grammatical categories and their semantic implications. You must provide a clear comparison between the two sentences based on both grammatical structure and meaning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Grammar Rules**\n\nCreate a sentence that demonstrates the use of the SVOC structure (subject + transitive verb + direct object + object complement) as described in the text. Your sentence must:\n- **Part A**: Use a subject (S) that is a personal pronoun.\n- **Part B**: Include a transitive verb (V) that is commonly used with an object complement.\n- **Part C**: Add a direct object (dO) that is a concrete noun.\n- **Part D**: Include an object complement (oC) that modifies the direct object.\n- **Part E**: Justify your sentence''s structure by referencing the example provided in the text (e.g., ''The example "You have made me very happy" illustrates...'').\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must be grammatically correct and follow the specified structure. You must explicitly reference at least one example from the text to support your reasoning.'

- prompt: "agentive  \nIn sentences with a transitive or intransitive verb, the subject typically has an  \nagentive role: the person that performs the action:  \n\nMartha has switched on the television.  \nCaroline is calling.  \n\nidentified  \nThe identified role is typical of structures with a linking verb:  \n\nJeremy was my best friend.  \nDoris is my sister-in-law.  \n\ncharacterized  \nThe characterized role is also typical of structures with a linking verb:  \n\nThis brand of coffee tastes better.  \nPaul is an excellent student.  \n\naffected  \n\nWith intransitive verbs the subject frequently has the affected role: the person  \nor thing directly affected by the action, but not intentionally performing the  \naction:  \n\nThey are drowning.  \nThe water has boiled.  \n\nor  \nSometimes there is no participant.

They refer to something that happens:  \n\nHer books se// well.  \nWe talked about you last night.  \nYour ball has broken my window.  \nI listened to her respectfully.  \n\nDynamic verbs, but not stative verbs, occur quite normally with the -img form  \n(cf. 4.12, 4.14):  \n\nHer books are selling well.  \nWe were talking about you last night.  \nThey have been playing in the yard.  \nShe is /ooking at us.  \n\nWhen stative verbs are used with the -img form, they have been transformed into  \ndynamic verbs:  \n\nTheir children are beimg noisy.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Verb Tense and Form**\n\nConvert the following sentences into present perfect tense, ensuring your answers adhere to the rules of verb form and grammatical roles as described in the text:\n1. She sleeps soundly every night.\n2. The sun rises in the east.\n3. He is looking at us.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: For each sentence, identify the grammatical role of the subject and the direct object (if any).\n- **Part B**: Explain how the -img form transforms a stative verb into a dynamic verb, using one of your converted sentences as an example.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of using the present perfect tense in sentences where the action is ongoing, such as ''The water has boiled''.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answers must demonstrate mastery of verb tense conversion and the distinction between stative and dynamic verbs as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Analytical Reasoning with Grammatical Structures**\n\nConsider the sentences ''Caroline is calling'' and ''They are drowning''.\n- **Part A**: Determine the grammatical role of ''calling'' and ''drowning'' in these sentences, explaining whether they are *intransitive* or *transitive* verbs.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the use of ''is'' in these two sentences with the use of ''has'' in ''The water has boiled''. How does this affect the interpretation of the subject''s role?\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence that uses an *identified* role with a linking verb and another sentence that uses an *affected* role with an intransitive verb. Justify your choices based on the text''s definitions of grammatical roles.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of grammatical roles and verb types as described in the text, demonstrating clear analytical reasoning and application of the definitions provided.'

    He's written an account of his travels.
    I'm knitting a sweater for myself.

    3. eventive
    The direct object may refer to an event. The eventive object generally con-
    tains a noun that is derived from a verb. In typical use, the noun carries the
    main part of the meaning that is normally carried by the verb, and is preceded
    by a verb of general meaning, such as do, have, or make:

    They were having a quarrel. (cf: They were quarrelling.)
    I have made my choice. (cf: I have chosen.)

    Indirect object

    The indirect object typically has a recipient role: the person that is indirectly
    involved in the action, generally the person receiving something or intended to
    receive something, or benefiting in some way:

    They paid me the full amount.
    He bought Sandra a bunch of flowers.
    David has been showing Andrew his computer printout.

    Subject complement and object complement

    The complement typically has the role of attribute. It attributes an identification
    or characterization to the subject — if it is a subject complement (sC) — or the direct
    object — if it is an object complement (oC):

    sC: Susan is my accountant.

    sC: Ronald became a paid agitator.

    oC: I have made David my assistant.

    oC: The sun has turned our curtains yellow.

    Adverbial

    Adverbials have a wide range of meanings, some of which apply to adverbial
    complements (cf. 3.10, 3.12). Here are some typical examples:

    1. space

    My school is south of the river. (position in space)
    She has gone to the bank. (direction)
    The Parts of the Simple Sentence

    time

    They're staying with us for a few weeks. (duration)
    We come here quite often. (frequency)

    than one adverbial.

    Opossums frequently appear to be dead.

    Sometimes they merely pretend to be dead.

    In that way they avoid attacks by predators.

    Often they simply are dead.

    Few opossums remain alive far into the second year.

    According to one biologist, two-year-old opossums show the symptoms of
    advanced old age.

    Over many centuries, opossums have died at early ages because of accidents
    and predators.

    As a result, natural selection ends especially early in opossums' lives.

    Bad mutations accumulate in older opossums.

    The natural-selection theory apparently explains their short lives.

In Chapter 3 we were mainly concerned with their function in the sentence, and we distinguished functional elements such as subject and direct object. In this chapter we are mainly concerned with the internal structure of the elements. For the simple sentence, this means the structure of the various phrases that can function in the sentence as subject, verb, etc.  \n\nThere are five types of phrases:  \n\n1. noun phrase a peaceful result  \n(main word: noun result)  \n2. verb phrase must have been dreaming  \n(main word: verb dreaming)  \n3. adjective phrase very pleasant  \n(main word: adjective pleasant)  \n4. adverb phrase very carefully  \n(main word: adverb carefully)  \n5. prepositional phrase in the shade  \n(main word: preposition in the shade)  \n\nIn grammar, the technical term \"phrase\" is used even if there is only one word — the main word alone; for example, both very pleasant and pleasant are adjective phrases. This may seem strange at first, since in everyday use the word \"phrase\" applies to a sequence of at least two words. There is a good reason for the wider use of the term in grammar. Many rules that apply to an adjective phrase apply also to an adjective. For example, the same rules apply to the positions of very pleasant and pleasant in these sentences:  \n\npleasant  \nIt was a pleasant occasion.  \nvery pleasant\n\nThe text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson."

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Comparative Phrase Structure Analysis**\n\nCompare the phrase types of **very pleasant** and **pleasant** as described in the text.\n- **Part A**: Explain how both are classified as adjective phrases according to the text''s definition of phrase types.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the difference in their function within a sentence, using the examples provided (e.g., ''It was a pleasant occasion'' vs. ''The very pleasant occasion'').\n- **Part C**: Analyze how the presence of an adverb (very) affects the phrase type and its role in modifying the adjective.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must directly reference the text''s explanation of phrase types and demonstrate an understanding of how adverbs modify phrases.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Sentence Construction with Phrase Types**\n\nCreate a sentence that includes an **agentive subject**, a **dynamic verb**, and a **prepositional phrase**, following the structure described in Exercise 3.22, specifically item 3: **Agentive subject + dynamic verb + recipient indirect object + affected direct object + space adverbial**.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the phrase types required for each part of the sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Construct a grammatically correct sentence that integrates all elements, using appropriate word order and function.\n- **Step 3**: Justify the choice of each phrase type based on their definitions in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must correctly incorporate all required phrase types and clearly explain how each part functions according to the text''s definitions.'

    The Structures of Phrases

    Instead of specifying each time 'adjective phrase or adjective' it is simpler to
    specify 'adjective phrase' and thereby include adjectives.

    In the sections that follow we will be looking at the structures of the five types of
    phrases, but I will make several general points now. First, a phrase may contain
    another phrase within it. Or, to put it another way, one phrase may be embedded
    within another phrase.

    [1] We had some very pleasant times in Florida.
    [2] They were standing in the shade of a large oak tree.

    In [1] the noun phrase some very pleasant times has the adjective phrase very
    pleasant embedded between some and times. In [2] the prepositional phrase consists
    of the preposition zm and the noun phrase the shade of a large oak tree; in the noun
    phrase another prepositional phrase (of a large oak tree) is embedded as a modifier
    of shade and that phrase contains the noun phrase a large oak tree. A clause (cf. 2.3)
    may also be embedded in a phrase:

    [3] The school that I attend is quite small.

    In [3] the clause that I attend is embedded in the noun phrase the school that I
    attend.

    A second point is that phrases are defined by their structure, but they are also
    characterized by their potential functions. For example, a noun phrase may func-
    tion (among other possibilities) as a subject, direct object, or indirect object.

    Third, there is an inevitable circularity in talking about phrases and words: a
    noun is a word that can be the main word in a noun phrase, and a noun phrase is
    a phrase whose main word is a noun.

    We will be examining classes of words more closely in the next chapter, but the
    classes must enter into the discussions of phrases in this chapter. The examples
    should be a sufficient indication of the types of words that are involved.

    THE NOUN PHRASE

    4.2 The structure of the noun phrase

    The main word in a noun phrase is a noun or a pronoun. There are a number of
    subclasses of nouns and pronouns, but I will postpone discussion of subclasses
    until we come to look at word classes (cf. 5.4, 5.17).

    48 An Introduction to English Grammar

    (determiners) (pre-modifiers) noun (post-modifiers)

    Determiners (words like the, a, those, some) introduce noun phrases. Modifiers are
    units that are dependent on the main word and can be omitted. Modifiers that
    come before the noun are pre-modifiers, and those that come after the noun are
    post-modifiers. Here are examples of possible structures of noun phrases:

    noun books

    determiner + noun those books
    pre-modifier + noun new books

    determiner + pre-modifier + noun some long books

    noun + post-modifier books on astronomy
    determiner + noun + post-modifier some books on astronomy

    pre-modifier + noun + post-modifier popular books on astronomy
    determiner + pre-modifier + noun +
    post-modifier some popular books on astronomy

    All these examples can fit into the blank in this sentence:
    I occasionally read ...............00008

    4.3 Determiners
    There are three classes of determiners (cf. 5.26—30):

    1. pre-determiners, e.g. all, both, half
    2. central determiners, e.g. a(n), the, those
    3. post-determiners, e.g. other, two, first

    Here are two examples with determiners from each class:
    all these other works
    both our two daughters

    4.4 Modifiers

    The noun phrase may have more than one pre-modifier or post-modifier:
    a long hot summer

    acute, life-threatening diseases
    a nasty gash on lus chin which needed medical attention

    There are two post-modifiers in the last example because each separately modifies
    gash: a nasty gash on his chin; a nasty gash which needed medical attention. The
    modifier may itself be modified (cf. 4.21):

    The Structures of Phrases

    a comfortably coo/ room
    the investigation of crimes against children

    A modifier may also be discontinuous, one part coming before the noun and the
    other part after it:

    the easiest children to teach

    Compare:

    the children (who are) easiest to teach

    4.5 Relative clauses

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Noun Phrase Structures**\n\nConstruct a noun phrase that fits into the blank in this sentence: ''I occasionally read ...............'' using all three classes of determiners (pre-determiner, central determinant, and post-determiner) as shown in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Choose a pre-determiner, central determiner, and post-determiner from the examples provided in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Arrange them according to the structure: [pre-determiner] + [central determiner] + [post-determiner] + noun.\n- **Step 3**: Justify the choice of each determiner class and explain how it contributes to the meaning of the noun phrase.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your constructed phrase must include all three determiner classes and demonstrate an understanding of their roles in noun phrase construction.'

    One very common type of post-modifier is the relative clause:
    He had a nasty gash which needed medical attention.

    The relative clause is embedded in the noun phrase. As an independent sentence it
    might be:

    [1] The gash needed medical attention.

    We might think of the embedding as a process that takes place in stages. The first
    stage puts the sentence close to the noun it will be modifying:

    [la] He had a nasty gash. The gash needed medical attention.

    You will notice that the two sentences share nouns (gash) that refer to the same
    thing. The next stage changes the noun phrase into a relative pronoun (cf. 5.24) —
    here which:

    [1b] He had a nasty gash which needed medical attention.

    The relative pronoun which functions as subject in the relative clause just as The

    gash functions as subject in [la].
    Here is another example:

    [2] The woman is an engineering student. The woman was sitting next to you.
    [2a] The woman (The woman was sitting next to you) is an engineering student.
    [2b] The woman who was sitting next to you is an engineering student.

    In both [1b] and [2b] the relative pronoun can be replaced by relative that:

    49
    50

    An Introduction to English Grammar

    [1c] He had a nasty gash that needed medical attention.
    [2c] The woman that was sitting next to you is an engineering student.

    For the choice of relative pronouns, see 5.24.

    4.6 Appositive clauses
    Another type of clause that is often embedded in a noun phrase is the appositive

    clause. It is introduced by the conjunction that:

    the assumption that people act out of self-interest
    the fact that she rejected his offer of marriage

    the realization that miracles don't happen

    the news that agreement has been reached

    The conjunction that in appositive clauses differs from the relative that (cf. 4.5)
    because the conjunction does not have a function within its clause. The appositive

    clause can be a sentence without that:

    [1] You must have heard the news that agreement has been reached.
    [la] Agreement has been reached.

    In contrast, the relative clause cannot be a sentence without the relative that:

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Relative Clause Structures**\n\nCompare the relative clauses in [1b] and [2b] with their corresponding that-clauses [1c] and [2c].\n- **Step 1**: Explain how the relative pronoun ''which'' functions in [1b] and ''who'' in [2b], referencing the role of relative pronouns as subjects.\n- **Step 2**: Demonstrate the equivalence between ''which'' and ''that'' by rephrasing [1b] into [1c], emphasizing the grammatical relationship between the clauses.\n- **Step 3**: Contrast ''that'' in appositive clauses (e.g., [1]) with ''that'' in relative clauses (e.g., [2c]), highlighting the functional difference between the two uses of ''that''.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly link the grammatical roles of relative pronouns and conjunctions based on the text provided.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Appositive Clause Functions**\n\nExamine the appositive clauses in the examples provided (e.g., ''the assumption that people act out of self-interest'').\n- **Part A**: Identify the grammatical function of the conjunction ''that'' in these appositive clauses, contrasting it with its role in relative clauses.\n- **Part B**: Construct an original appositive clause using the structure ''the [noun] that [verb phrase]'', ensuring it correctly uses ''that'' without a subject or object.\n- **Part C**: Explain why the appositive clause ''the news that agreement has been reached'' can stand alone as a sentence, while the relative clause ''The woman that was sitting next to you is an engineering student'' cannot.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the structural and functional differences between appositive clauses and relative clauses.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Clause Types**\n\nGiven the examples of relative and appositive clauses, analyze the following statement: ''The man who is wearing a red shirt is my brother.''\n- **Part A**: Determine whether ''who'' functions as a relative pronoun or the conjunction ''that'' in an appositive clause. Justify your answer using the text''s explanation of relative pronoun roles.\n- **Part B**: Construct a similar sentence using an appositive clause structure, ensuring it correctly uses ''that'' without a subject or object.\n- **Part C**: Explain the logical distinction between a relative clause (e.g., ''the man who is wearing...'') and an independent appositive clause (e.g., ''the assumption that...''), referencing the text''s description of how appositive clauses differ from relative clauses.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the grammatical functions of clause types as described in the text.'

- prompt: |-
    [2] He had a nasty gash that needed medical attention.
    [2a] *Needed medical attention.

    We can convert the noun phrase containing the appositive clause into a sentence
    by inserting a form of the verb de before the clause:

    [3] the assumption that people act out of self-interest.
    [3a] The assumption zs that people act out of self-interest.

    4.7 Apposition

    Apposition is a relationship between two noun phrases which have identical
    reference:

    Bono, the lead singer with U2, also took part.

    As with the appositive clause, we can show that the lead singer with U2 is in
    apposition to Bono by converting the two phrases into a sentence:

    Bono is the lead singer with U2.
    The Structures of Phrases

    Here are some more examples of noun phrases in apposition:

    our Political Correspondent, Eleanor Goodman

    vitamin B,,, a complex cobalt-containing molecule

    the witness, a burly man with heavy stubble

    the rattlesnake, a venomous animal capable of causing death in human beings

    Apposition is sometimes signalled by expressions such as namely and that 1s to say:
    You can read the story in the first book of the Bible, namely Genesis.

    4.8 Coordination

    We can coordinate (‘link') noun phrases with and or or:

    all the senators and some of their aides
    law schools or medical schools
    my sister, her husband, avd their three children

    We can also coordinate parts of a noun phrase. Coordinated modifiers may apply
    as a unit:

    wholesome and tasty food [food that is both wholesome and tasty]

    a calm and reassuring gesture [a gesture that is both calm and reassuring]

    an appetizer of blackberries and raspberries [an appetizer that consists of
    both blackberries and raspberries]

    Or they may apply separately:

    chemical and biological weapons [chemical weapons and biological weapons]

    electric and magnetic fields [electric fields and magnetic fields]

    large or small classes [large classes or small classes]

    houses along the coast and on the lower hills [houses along the coast and
    houses on the lower hills]

    A determiner may serve two or more nouns or modified nouns:

    his wife and two sons [his wife and his two sons]

    some friends and close acquaintances [some friends and some close
    acquaintances]

    It is sometimes possible to interpret coordination of parts of phrases in more
    than one way:

    4.9 Noun phrase complexity

    Noun phrases can display considerable structural complexity. It is easy to embed
    in them appositional structures, clauses, and linked noun phrases. Both the subject
    and the direct object in [1] are complex noun phrases:

    [1] Wordsworth's several reactions to tourism's threat to treasured precincts ex-
    hibit tendencies we can also observe in many nineteenth- and twentieth-century
    records.

    [James Buzard, The Beaten Track, p. 30. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993]

    Here are two other examples of complex noun phrases functioning as subject of the
    sentences:

    [2] A full-blown financial collapse of the kind last seen in the 1930s is not out of
    the question.

    [3] Tron resolve in the fight against internationalism terrorism and determined
    leadership on the budget and the economy could make Mr Bush the president
    no one ever really thought he could be.

    In [4] the complex noun phrase is subject complement and in [5] it is a direct

    object:

    [4] Taxonomy is a practical science used to distinguish, name, and arrange plants
    and other organisms in a logical way.

    [5] Daniel Blumenthal gives performances of the two concertante pieces which

    convincingly combine Ravelian delicacy of articulation mith genuine feeling for
    the jazz-based idiom.

    For all verbs except be, there are two forms for the present: the -s form and the
    base form. The -s form is used for the third person singular, that is with he, she, it,
    and singular noun phrases as subject:

    He plays football every day.
    The road seems narrower.

    The base form is used for all other subjects: I, you, we, they, and plural noun
    phrases as subject:

    I play football every day.
    The roads seem narrower.

    Be has three forms for the present tense, which are distinct from the base form be:
    am — first person singular
    is — third person singular

    are — others

    For all verbs except be, there is only one past form:

    55

    56

    An Introduction to English Grammar

    He (or They) played football yesterday.
    The road (or roads) seemed narrower.

    Be has two forms for the past:

    was — first and third person singular
    were — others

    The two tenses are related to distinctions in time, but they do not correspond
    precisely to the difference between present and past in the real world. The present
    tense generally refers to a time that includes the time of speaking but usually
    extends backward and forward in time:

    Three and five make eight.
    We live in Sydney.

    I work in the steel industry.
    They are my neighbours.

    Sometimes the present refers to an event that is simultaneous with the time of
    speaking:

    Here comes your sister.
    I nominate Robert.

    4.14 Aspect

    Aspect is a grammatical category referring to the way that the time of a situation is
    viewed by the speaker or writer; the aspect is indicated by a combination of auxiliary
    and verb form. Verbs have two aspects: the perfect aspect and the progressive aspect.

    The perfect of a verb combines a form of the auxiliary have with the -ed par-
    ticiple of that verb. The auxiliary has two present tense forms (has, have) and one
    past form (had). For example, the present perfect of close is has closed or have
    closed and the past perfect is had closed:

    I have closed the shop for the day.
    The shop has closed for the day.
    The police had closed the shop months ago.

    The present perfect refers to a situation set in some indefinite period that leads
    to the present. The situation may be a state of affairs that extends to the present:

    Or it may be an event or set of events that is viewed as possibly recurring:

    We have discussed your problems.
    I have phoned him every day since he fell ill.
    He has read only newspapers until now.

    The past perfect refers to a situation earlier than another situation set in the past:
    We had heard a lot about her before we ever met her.

    In many contexts, the present perfect and the past perfect can be replaced by
    the past.

    The progressive combines a form of the auxiliary be with the -ing participle. The
    present progressive and the past progressive are illustrated below:

    You are neglecting your work.

    I am resting just now.

    The children were fighting all morning.
    We were waiting for you in the lobby.

    The progressive indicates that the situation is in progress. It may therefore also
    imply that it lasts for only a limited period and that it is not ended. Contrast J
    read a novel last night (which implies that I finished it) with J was reading a novel
    last night.

    4.15 Voice

    Verbs have two voices: active and passive. The active is the voice that is used
    most commonly. The active and passive have different verb phrases in that the
    passive has an additional auxiliary: a form of the auxiliary be followed by an -ed
    participle. Here are examples of corresponding active and passive verb phrases:

    Active Passive

    loves is loved

    sold was sold

    is fighting is being fought

    has reconstructed has been reconstructed
    will proclaim will be proclaimed

    may have asserted may have been asserted

    should be purifying should be being purified

    The passive is a way of phrasing the sentence so that the subject does not refer
    to the person or thing responsible (directly or indirectly) for the action. The

    57

    58

    An Introduction to English Grammar

    passive therefore differs from the corresponding active not only in the forms of the
    verb phrases but also in the positions of certain noun phrases. The direct object
    (dO) or the indirect object (IO) of the active sentence becomes the subject (S) of
    the corresponding passive sentence, and the subject (if retained) appears after the
    verb in a by-phrase:

    Active: A team of detectives (S) is investigating the crime (dO)

    Passive: The crime (S) is being investigated by a team of detectives.

    Active: The new management (S) has offered employees (iO) a better deal.

    Passive: Employees (S) have been offered a better deal by the new management.

    Active: Three bullets (S) penetrated /us heart (dO).

    Passive: His heart (S) was penetrated by three bullets.

    Active: Scientists (S) predicted the location, extent, and strength of the earthquake (dO) with unprecedented accuracy.

    Passive: The location, extent, and strength of the earthquake (S) were predicted by scientists with unprecedented accuracy.

    Generally the passive sentence does not contain the by-phrase:

    Britain's reservations on these points were duly noted.
    Most of the buildings were destroyed.
    The decision has already been taken.

    The most common reason for using the passive is to avoid referring to the person performing the action. That may be because the identity of the person is not known or because it is felt to be unnecessary to identify the person (perhaps because it is irrelevant or obvious) or it is felt to be tactless to do so:

    He was immediately admitted to the hospital.
    The refrigerator door has not been properly closed.

    Some -ed participle forms may be used as adjectives. In the following sentences the -ed forms are adjectives, not passive participles:

    She was annoyed with them.
    I am worried about Edward.
    My teachers are pleased with my progress.

    These sentences look like passive sentences, but the -ed words are adjectives if one or more of these possibilities apply:

    1. if they can be modified by very (for example, very annoyed);
    2. if they can occur with a linking verb other than be (for example, became worried);
    3. if they can be linked with another adjective (for example, angry and worried).

    The -ed participle form is obviously an adjective in Many seats were unsold when I rang the ticket office because there is no verb unsell.

    4.16 Expressing future time

    In 4.13 I stated that verbs have only two tenses: present and past. How then do we refer to future time?

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Passive Voice Structure\n\nRewrite the following active sentences in passive voice, ensuring that the by-phrase is included where appropriate and that the sentence structure adheres to the rules of passive voice as outlined in the text:\n1. The new management has offered employees a better deal.\n2. Three bullets penetrated our heart.\n3. Scientists predicted the location, extent, and strength of the earthquake with unprecedented accuracy.\n\n**Task**: For each sentence, identify the subject (S), object (iO), and the action verb. Then, apply the passive structure by reordering these components and including the by-phrase where necessary. Justify your transformation using the text''s explanation of passive voice and its use in avoiding direct reference to the agent.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your responses must correctly transform each active sentence into passive voice and demonstrate an understanding of when to include the by-phrase based on the text''s examples.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Differentiation of -ed Participle Forms\n\nClassify the underlined -ed forms in the following sentences as either passive participles or adjectives, providing clear justification for each classification based on the text''s criteria:\n1. She was annoyed with them.\n2. I am worried about Edward.\n3. My teachers are pleased with my progress.\n4. Many seats were unsold when I rang the ticket office.\n\n**Task**: For each sentence, apply at least one of the four criteria provided in the text (e.g., whether the -ed form can be modified by very, used with a linking verb other than be, linked with another adjective, or is clearly an adjective in context). Explain why each -ed form is classified as an adjective rather than a passive participle.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your classifications must align with the text''s definitions and demonstrate a clear understanding of the distinguishing features between passive participles and adjectives.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Future Time and Passive Voice Integration\n\nConstruct a sentence that uses both future time expressions and passive voice, following the text''s explanation of how verbs can express future time. Your sentence must also incorporate at least one of the examples provided in the text for passive voice usage (e.g., ''Britain''s reservations on these points were duly noted'').\n\n**Task**: First, identify a future action that would typically be expressed in the active voice. Then, convert it into passive voice while incorporating a future time marker (e.g., ''will be'', ''are going to be''). Ensure that the sentence reflects the text''s explanation of when passive voice is used to avoid referring to the agent.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must correctly use passive voice with a future time expression and demonstrate an understanding of the purpose behind using passive voice in this context.'

    There are only two tenses in the sense that these are the two distinctions that we
    make through the forms of the verbs. However, there are various ways of express-
    ing future time. One way is through the simple present tense:

    My sister arrives tomorrow.

    The most common way is by combining mi// (or the contraction '//) with the
    base form:

    My sister will arrive tomorrow.
    Pil talk to you next week.

    Many speakers in England also use sha// instead of wi// when the subject is J or we:
    I shall make a note of your request.
    Two other common ways are the use of be going to and the present progressive:

    I'm going to study during the vacation.
    We're playing your team next week.
    4.17. The sequence of auxiliaries

    In 4.11 I referred to the four types of auxiliaries. Here again is the diagram
    representing the sequence:

    auxiliary 1 auxiliary 2 auxiliary 3 auxiliary 4 main verb

    If we choose to use auxiliaries, they must appear in the following sequence:

    [1] modal auxiliary, such as can, may, will (cf. 5.31)
    [2] perfect auxiliary have
    [3] progressive auxiliary be
    [4] passive auxiliary be

    These four uses of the auxiliaries specify the form of the verb that follows:

    [1] modal, followed by base form: may phone

    [2] perfect have, followed by -ed participle: have phoned
    [3] progressive be, followed by -ing participle: is phoning
    [4] passive be, followed by -ed participle: was phoned

    Gaps in the sequence are of course normal:

    [1] + [3]: will be phoning (modal + progressive)
    [2] + [4]: has been phoned (perfect + passive)

    [2] + [3]: has been phoning (perfect + progressive)
    [1] + [4]: can be phoned (modal + passive)

    The sequence does not take account of the dummy operator do (cf. 3.4), which is
    introduced when there would otherwise not be an auxiliary in the verb phrase.
    In this function, do is therefore the only auxiliary present. It is followed by the
    base form:

    I did phone.

    Did you phone?

    I did not phone.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Tense and Auxiliary Use**\n\nConsider the sentence: "I will be phoning you tomorrow."\n- **Part A**: Identify the tense and auxiliary structure used in this sentence.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the sequence of auxiliaries (modal + progressive) in this sentence reflects the rules outlined in 4.17 of the text.\n- **Part C**: Compare this structure with the simple present tense used in "My sister arrives tomorrow." Discuss how the choice of tense affects the speaker''s intention regarding future time.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the sequence of auxiliaries and the distinction between simple present and future tenses as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Auxiliary Sequences**\n\nExamine the sentence: "She has been phoned by the manager."\n- **Part A**: Identify the sequence of auxiliaries used in this sentence.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the perfect + passive (has been phoned) structure aligns with the rules in 4.17 regarding auxiliary sequences.\n- **Part C**: Compare this structure with the progressive (is phoning) and perfect (has phoned) forms. Discuss how different auxiliary combinations modify the meaning of the verb.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of how auxiliary sequences affect the meaning and form of verbs as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Verb Forms**\n\nConsider the sentence: "I did not phone."\n- **Part A**: Identify the tense and auxiliary structure used in this sentence.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the use of ''did'' as a dummy operator (cf. 3.4) modifies the verb phrase according to the rules in the text.\n- **Part C**: Compare this structure with the modal + perfect (can have phoned) and modal + passive (can be phoned) forms. Discuss how the presence or absence of ''did'' changes the interpretation of the action described.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the function of ''did'' as a dummy operator and how it interacts with auxiliary sequences as outlined in the text.'

    Martha phoned, and I did too.

    There are also phrasal auxiliaries, which are intermediate between auxiliaries and main verbs. Here are some examples:

    Sandra is going to apply for the job.

    I had better eat now.

    My parents are about to leave.

    We have got to speak to her.

    He may be able to help us.

    Jennifer is supposed to phone us today.

    Only the first word in a phrasal auxiliary is a true auxiliary, since only that word functions as an operator, for example in forming questions (cf. 3.3):

    Is Sandra going to apply for the job?
    Had I better eat now?
    Is Jennifer supposed to phone us today?

    The Structures of Phrases
    The phrasal auxiliaries may come together to make a long string of verbs:

    We seem to be going to have to keep on paying the full fee.
    They are likely to be about to manage to start working on our project.

    4.18 Finite and non-finite verb phrases

    Verb phrases are either finite or non-finite. A finite verb is a verb that carries a contrast in tense between present and past, and may also be marked for person and number. In a finite verb phrase the first or only verb is finite, and the other verbs (if any) are non-finite. In a non-finite verb phrase all the verbs are non-finite. Play and played are finite verbs in these sentences:

    [1] We play football every day.
    [2] We played in a football match last week.

    Play is in the present tense in [1] and played is in the past tense in [2]. In [3] plays is the third person singular form of the present:

    [3] She plays hockey.

    On the other hand, in [4] will is the finite verb (the past of will is would), whereas play is non-finite:

    [4] We will play football later today.
    Similarly, in [5] have is the finite verb and played is non-finite:
    [5] We have played football every day this week.

    All the verb phrases in [1]-[5] are finite verb phrases because they begin with a finite verb.
    The following are the non-finite verb forms:

    [3] My boss insists that I be on time.
    [4] I move that the meeting de adjourned.

    In verbs other than be, the present subjunctive has a distinctive form only in the
    third person singular: the base form, which contrasts with the indicative form
    ending in -s. In other singular persons and in plurals, the base form is the same as
    the present tense form. Contrast [1] with [la]:

    [la] We demand that they take the witness stand.

    For all persons the negative sentence need not have an operator (cf. 3.31):

    [1b] We demand that he/they not take the witness stand.
    [4a] I move that the meeting not be adjourned.

    In the contexts exemplified in [1]}-|4] we commonly use should followed by the
    base form, instead of the subjunctive:

    [1c] We demand that he should take the witness stand.
    [3a] My boss insists that I should be on time.

    Another possibility, when the verb is not de, is the indicative:
    [1d] We demand that he takes the witness stand.
    2. certain set expressions:

    Long /ive the Republic!
    Be that as it may,...

    The past subjunctive were is used chiefly to convey that the speaker is not sure
    that the situation will happen or is happening:

    [5] If he were to be appointed, I would leave.

    [6] If they were in the city, they would contact us.
    [7] I wish you were here.

    [8] I wish I were somewhere hotter than here.

    Were is also the past indicative form, so that the subjunctive and indicative are
    identical except where was is required as a past indicative — in the first and third
    persons singular (J was, he was). Were therefore is a distinctive form as subjunctive
    only in [5] and [8]. In fact, except in formal style, indicative mas is commonly used
    in place of the past subjunctive in the first and third persons singular:
    [5a] If he was to be appointed, I would leave.
    [8a] I wish I was somewhere hotter than here.

- prompt: "Multi-word verbs are combinations of a verb and one or more other words. They  \nare called multi-word verbs because in certain respects they behave as a single verb.\n\nThe most frequent types of multi-word verbs consist of a verb followed by one  \nor more particles (words that do not change their form) such as at, away, by, and  \nfor. The three major types of these combinations are:\n\nphrasal verbs, e.g. give in, blow up  \nprepositional verbs, e.g. look after, approve of  \nphrasal-prepositional verbs, e.g. look down on, catch up with\n\nThere are sometimes one-word verbs that are similar in meaning to the multi-  \nword verbs. The one-word verbs are more formal:\n\nphrasal verb give in — surrender  \nprepositional verb look after — tend  \nphrasal prepositional verb put up with — tolerate\n\nPhrasal verbs and prepositional verbs are a combination of a verb and one  \nparticle, whereas phrasal-prepositional verbs have two particles. A preposi-  \ntional verb requires an object to complete the sentence:\n\n[1] Peter is looking after his elderly parents.\n\nA transitive phrasal verb also requires an object:\n\n[2] All the students have handed in their essays.\n\nAn intransitive phrasal verb does not require an object:\n\n[3] I give up.\n\nWe can distinguish transitive phrasal verbs from prepositional verbs by testing  \nwhether the particle can come before the object as well as after the object.

    Further examples of intransitive phrasal verbs are in [4]-[6] and transitive
    phrasal verbs in [7]-[9]:

    [4] The discussions went on for a long time.

    [5] They stood up when she entered the room.

    [6] The excitement has died down.

    [7] I can't make out your handwriting.

    [9] Cornelia has finally brought out her new book.

    [9a] Cornelia has finally brought her new book out.

    There are three types of prepositional verbs. The first type is followed by a
    prepositional object, which differs from direct and indirect objects in that a
    preposition introduces it:

    [10] My aunt is looking after my brothers.
    [11] The principal called for references.
    [12] Heavy smoking leads to cancer.

    Like other objects, prepositional objects can be questioned by who or what:

    [10a] Who is your aunt looking after?
    — My brothers.

    [12a] What does heavy smoking lead to?
    — Cancer.

    And they can often be made the subject of a corresponding passive sentence:

    [11a] References were called for.

    65
    66 An Introduction to English Grammar

    The second type of prepositional verb has two objects: a direct object and a pre-
    positional object. The direct object comes before the particle, and the prepositional
    object follows the particle:

    [13] He blamed the accident on the weather.

    [14] You may order a drink for me.

    [15] I have explained the procedure to the children.
    [16] They were making fun of you.

    [17] I have just caught sight of them.

    In some cases the direct object is part of an idiomatic unit, as in make fun of [16]
    and catch sight of [17].

    The third type of prepositional verb also has two objects, but the first is an
    indirect object:

    They told us about your success.
    She forgave me for my rude remark.
    I congratulated her on her promotion.

- prompt: |-
    The indirect object refers to a person who typically has the recipient role (cf. 3.14).
    The preposition in all three types of prepositional verbs ordinarily cannot be
    moved from its position. But if the style is formal, in certain structures such as
    questions and relative clauses it may move with the object to the front. For
    example, the prepositional object in [13] is normally questioned like this:

    [13a] | What did he blame the accident on?
    But we could also place on in front, in a more formal style:
    [13b] | On what did he blame the accident?
    Finally, there are two types of phrasal-prepositional verbs, which have two
    particles (an adverb followed by a preposition). The first type has just the preposi-

    tional object:

    I have been catching up on my reading.
    They look down on their neighbours.

    The second type has a direct object and a prepositional object:

    I have put his problem down to inexperience.
    We put him up for election.

    The Structures of Phrases 67

    THE ADJECTIVE PHRASE

    4.21 The structure of the adjective phrase

    The main word in an adjective phrase is an adjective. The structure of the typical
    adjective phrase may be represented in the following way, where the parentheses
    indicate elements of the structure that may be absent:

    (pre-modifiers) adjective (post-modifiers)

    Modifiers qualify in some respect what is denoted by the adjective, and they are
    optional. The pre-modifier comes before the adjective and the post-modifier comes
    after it.

    Some post-modifiers complete what is implied in the meaning of the adjective.
    For example, if we say Tom is afraid we intend this to mean that Tom is filled with
    fear in some respect. The post-modifier specifies in what respect:

    of spiders.

    for his job.

    to say anything.

    that no one will believe him.

    [1] Tom is afraid

    A few adjectives (at least in certain senses) must have a post-modifier:

    [2] Mary is fond of children.
    [3] I am aware that he is abroad.
    [4] The contract is subject to approval by my committee.

    Some adjectives that take obligatory post-modifiers resemble verbs in their meaning:

    [la] Tom fears that no one will believe him.

    68 An Introduction to English Grammar

    4.22. Functions of adjective phrases
    These are the main possible functions of adjective phrases:

    1. pre-modifier in a noun phrase
    He was a ta// man, dressed in a blue suit.
    2. subject complement
    The photographs were quite professional.
    3. object complement
    My parents made me aware of my filial responsibilities.
    4. post-modifier in a noun phrase
    The OS/2 makes good use of the memory available.

    Indefinite pronouns, such as somebody, require the adjective phrase to follow them:

    You should choose somebody older.
    I bought something quite expensive today.

    There are also some set expressions (mostly legal or official designations) where
    the adjective follows the noun:

    heir apparent attorney general
    court martial notary public

    Here are some more examples of adjective phrases as post-modifiers of noun
    phrases:

    the earliest time possible
    in years past

    the people responsible
    the weapons involved

    Central adjectives are adjectives that can fulfil all the four possible functions
    listed above. There are also some adjectives that can be only pre-modifiers and
    others that cannot be pre-modifiers (cf. 5.13).

    Adjectives can be partially converted into nouns and then like nouns can func-
    tion as heads of noun phrases. Typically, such phrases refer to well-established
    classes of persons, such as the disabled, the poor, the sick, the unemployed, the young.
    Nationality adjectives are commonly used in this way, too: the British, the English,
    the French, the Irish. These noun phrases are plural, even though the adjectives do
    not have a plural ending:

    The sick require immediate attention.
    The British are coming.
    The Structures of Phrases

    Some adjectives, particularly superlatives (cf. 5.14), function as heads of noun
    phrases that are abstract. These noun phrases are singular:

    The best 1s yet to come.
    The latest 1s that our team is winning.

    THE PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE

    4.25 The structure of the prepositional phrase

    The prepositional phrase is a structure with two parts:

    preposition complement

    The prepositional complement is typically a noun phrase, but it may also be a
    nominal relative clause (cf. 6.9) or an -ing clause (cf. 6.8). Both the nominal relative
    clause and the -ing clause have a range of functions similar to that of a noun
    phrase.

    1. complement as noun phrase
    through the window

    The Structures of Phrases

    2. complement as nominal relative clause

    from what I heard (‘from that which I heard')
    3. complement as -ing clause

    after speaking to you

    As its name suggests, the preposition (‘preceding position') normally comes before
    the prepositional complement. There are several exceptions, however, where the
    complement is moved and the preposition is left stranded by itself. The stranding
    is obligatory when the complement is transformed into the subject of the sentence:

    Your case will soon be attended to.
    This ball is for you to play with.
    The picture is worth looking at.

    In questions and relative clauses the prepositional complement may be a pronoun
    or adverb that is fronted. In that case, the preposition is normally stranded:

    Who are you waiting for?

    Where are you coming from?

    I am the person (that) you are waiting for. [In relative clauses the pronoun
    may be omitted. ]

    In formal style the preposition is fronted with its complement:

    For whom are you waiting?
    From where are you coming?
    I am the person for whom you are waiting.

    4.26 Functions of prepositional phrases

    Prepositional phrases have three main functions:

    1. post-modifier of a noun

    I took several courses in history.

    The local council is subsidizing the installation of energy-saving devices.
    2. post-modifier of an adjective

    We were not aware of his drinking problem.
    I was happy with my marks last term.

    3. adverbial

    After the storm, the sky brightened.
    In my opinion, people behave differently from crowds.

    Fire is not used in microwave cooking.

    Electromagnetic energy agitates the water molecules in the food.

    The agitation produces sufficient heat for cooking.

    The electronic tube that produces microwave energy is called a magnetron.
    The magnetron was in use a decade before the birth of the microwave oven.
    Two scientists invented it during World War II.

    The magnetron was essential to Britain's radar defences.

    The application of microwaves to the heating of food resulted from an accident.
    An engineer was testing a magnetron tube.

    He reached into his pocket for a chocolate bar.

    The chocolate had melted.

    He had not felt any heat.

    The chocolate had been near radiation from the tube.

    Later experiments showed that heat from microwaves could cook food.
    The food was cooked from the inside.

    The V-2 was a big step towards a spaceliner.
    It could reach space.

    But there was still a major breakthrough to be made: reaching orbit.

    The main obstacle to this was the amount of fuel required.

    Most of the work from the engine was used to accelerate the V-2 to high
    speed.

    To reach orbit an object must accelerate to a speed of about 17,500 miles per
    hour (called satellite speed or orbital velocity) in a horizontal direction.

    It is far easier to launch a spacecraft to reach satellite height than satellite
    speed.

    If you threw a ball upwards from the ground at 4000 miles per hour, it would
    reach a maximum height of 100 miles before falling back to Earth about six
    minutes later.

    This is less than a quarter of the speed needed to sustain a satellite in orbit.
    It requires less than one-sixteenth of the energy (which is proportional to the
    speed squared).

    In order to reach orbit a V-2 would have to be filled with propellant up to as
    much as 98 per cent of its take-off weight.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Grammatical Structures**\n\nAnalyze the sentence: "The V-2 was a big step towards a spaceliner."\n- **Part A**: Identify the main verb and its tense.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the passive voice is used in this sentence and what information it conveys about the V-2''s historical significance.\n- **Part C**: Compare this passive construction to the active voice (e.g., "A big step towards a spaceliner was the V-2"). Discuss the implications of using passive versus active voice in technical writing.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must connect grammatical structures to the meaning conveyed in the sentence, and you must provide a clear comparison between passive and active voice.\n'

    Disposing of nuclear waste is a problem that has recently gained much attention.
    Authorities are having difficulties finding locations where nuclear waste can be
    disposed of safely.

    There is always the danger of the waste leaking very gradually from the
    containers in which it is stored.

    Because of this danger, many people have protested quite vehemently against
    the dumping of any waste in their communities.

    In the past, authorities have not responded quickly enough to problems at
    nuclear waste sites.

    As a result, people react somewhat suspiciously to claims that nuclear waste
    sites are safe.

    The problem of nuclear waste has caused many nuclear power plants to
    remain closed indefinitely.

    Authorities fear that this situation will very soon result in a power shortage.

    Word Classes

    5.1 Open and closed classes

    Word classes such as noun, verb, adjective, etc., are traditionally called parts of
    speech. There is not a fixed number of word classes. We can set up as many classes
    and subclasses as we need for our analysis. The more detailed our analysis, the
    more classes and subclasses we need.

    Word classes can be divided into open classes and closed classes. Open
    classes are readily open to new words; closed classes are limited classes that rarely
    admit new words. For example, it is easy to create new nouns, but not new
    pronouns.

    Listed below, with examples, are the classes that we will be examining in this
    chapter. They will be further divided into subclasses.

    Open classes

    noun Paul, paper, speech, play
    adjective young, cheerful, dark, round
    main verb talk, become, like, play
    adverb carefully, firmly, confidentially

    Closed classes

    pronoun she, somebody, one, who, that
    determiner a, the, that, each, some

    auxiliary (verb) can, may, will, have, be, do
    conjunction and, that, in order that, if, though
    preposition of, at, to, in spite of

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Phrase Structures**\n\nConstruct a sentence that follows the phrase structure: **prepositional phrase + noun phrase + verb phrase + adverb phrase**.\n- **Step 1**: Identify a prepositional phrase (e.g., "in the morning").\n- **Step 2**: Add a noun phrase (e.g., "the meeting").\n- **Step 3**: Include a verb phrase (e.g., "is happening").\n- **Step 4**: Insert an adverb phrase (e.g., "quickly").\n- **Step 5**: Combine all parts into a grammatically correct sentence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must strictly follow the specified structure and demonstrate understanding of each phrase type as defined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Classification of Word Classes**\n\nClassify the following words into open or closed classes, and identify at least one subclass for each.\n1. "play"\n2. "like"\n3. "although"\n4. "one"\n5. "can"\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Use the definitions of open and closed classes from the text to justify your classifications.\n- **Part B**: For each open class word, identify a relevant subclass (e.g., "main verb" for "play").\n- **Part C**: For each closed class word, specify the subclass (e.g., "pronoun" for "one").\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must align with the text''s classification system and demonstrate a clear understanding of the distinction between open and closed classes.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Grammar Concepts**\n\nThe text discusses open and closed classes of words. Consider the following statements:\n1. "New adjectives can easily be added to a sentence, but pronouns are not commonly added."\n2. "Auxiliary verbs like ''do'' and ''be'' are rarely changed, while main verbs like ''talk'' and ''like'' can vary."\n3. "Prepositions such as ''in'' and ''at'' have limited new words added to them."\n- **Part A**: Identify which statement best exemplifies the concept of open and closed classes.\n- **Part B**: Explain why ''do'' is considered a closed class word, referencing the text''s definition of auxiliary verbs.\n- **Part C**: Construct an example that illustrates how a new word can be added to an open class (e.g., ''sustainability'' as a noun).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s definitions and demonstrate reasoning based on the characteristics of open and closed classes.'

- prompt: |-
    There are also some more minor classes, such as the numerals (one, twenty-three,
    first) and the interjections (oh, ah, ouch). And there are some words that do not fit
    anywhere and should be treated individually, such as the negative not and the
    infinitive marker fo (as in fo say).

    The conjunction 'or' and the preposition in spite of are complex words
    even though each is written as three separate words.

    Word Classes

    5.2 Word classes and word uses

    In 5.1 some words are listed in more than one class. For instance, pay is both a
    noun and a verb; hat is a pronoun, a determiner, and a conjunction. Many more
    examples could be given of multiple membership of word classes. We can identify
    the class of some words by their form, as we will see in later sections of this
    chapter. But very often we can tell the class of a word only from its use in a con-
    text. Reply is a noun in:

    [1] I expect a reply before the end of the month.
    It is a verb in:
    [2] You should reply before the end of the month.

    It is particularly easy to convert nouns to verbs and to convert verbs to nouns.

    Reply in [1] and [2] represents two different words that share the same form.
    They are two different words, though related in meaning; they are entered as
    separate words in dictionaries (‘lexicons').

    If words happen to share the same form and are not related in meaning at all,
    they are homonyms; examples are peer (‘person belonging to the same group in
    age and status') and peer (‘look searchingly'), or peep (‘make a feeble shrill sound')
    and peep (‘look cautiously'). We can make further distinctions if we wish to empha-
    size identity in pronunciation or identity in spelling. If homonyms share the same
    sound but perhaps differ in spelling, they are homophones; examples are weigh
    and may or none and nun. On the other hand, if they share the same spelling but
    perhaps differ in pronunciation, they are homographs; examples are rom (‘line of
    objects') and row (‘quarrel').

    A word may have more than one grammatical form. The noun play has the singular play and the plural plays; the verb pay has the base form pay and the past played. It is common to use word for the grammatical form, so we can say that the past of the word see is saw and we can also say that the word sam is spelled with a final 's'. Sometimes there is neutralization in form: rather than having the distinctions found in most words, some words have only one neutral form. For example, the verb cut represents at least three grammatical forms:

    present tense I always cut my steak with this kind of knife.
    past tense I cut my finger earlier today.
    past participle I have cut my finger.

    The examples of word classes in 5.1 are 'lexical' words (listed as main entries in dictionaries), but they include any associated grammatical forms.

    We recognize the class of a word by its use in context. Some words have suffixes (endings added to words to form new words) that help to signal the class they belong to. These suffixes are not necessarily sufficient. For example, -ly is a typical suffix for adverbs (slowly, proudly), but we also find this suffix in adjectives: cowardly, homely, manly. And we can sometimes convert words from one class to another even though they have suffixes that are typical of their original class: an engineer, to engineer; a hopeful candidate, a hopeful.

    NOUNS

    5.3 Noun suffixes

    A noun is a word that can be the only or main word in a noun phrase (cf. 4.2). We cannot identify all nouns merely by their form, but certain suffixes can be added to verbs or adjectives to make nouns. Here are a few typical noun suffixes with words that exemplify them:

    -tion (and variants) education, relation, invasion, revision
    -er, -or camper, speaker, actor, supervisor
    -ism optimism, socialism, terrorism

    -ily mentality, normality, reality, sanity
    -ment environment, equipment, government
    -ness happiness, compactness, darkness

    Some suffixes were part of the words when they were borrowed from other languages: doctor, eternity, courage.

    5.4 Noun classes

    Nouns are common or proper. Proper nouns are the names of specific people,
    places, or occasions, and they usually begin with a capital letter: Shakespeare,
    Chicago, January, Christmas, Ramadan. Names may consist of more than one word:
    The Hague, The New York Times, Heathrow Airport, Captain Andrews, Mount
    Everest. Proper nouns are sometimes converted into common nouns: the Thompsons
    I know; the proper noun Thompson cannot ordinarily be made plural, but here the
    Thompsons means ‘the people in the family with the name Thompson'.
    Common nouns are nouns that are not names, such as capital in:

    The capital of the Netherlands is The Hague.

    Common nouns can be subclassified in two ways:

    1. type of referent: concrete or abstract
    2. grammatical form: count or non-count

    Word Classes 89

    Concrete nouns refer to people, places, or things: girl, kitchen, car. Abstract
    nouns refer to qualities, states, or actions: humour, belief; honesty. Some nouns may
    be either concrete or abstract, depending on their meaning:

    concrete Thomas can kick a football 50 yards.
    abstract Thomas often plays football on Saturdays.

    Count nouns refer to entities that are viewed as countable. Count nouns there-
    fore have both a singular and a plural form and they can be accompanied by
    determiners that refer to distinctions in number:

    a ten
    one student many > students
    every those

    Non-count nouns refer to entities that are viewed as an indivisible mass that
    cannot be counted; for example, information, furniture, software. Non-count nouns
    are treated as singular and can be accompanied only by determiners that do not
    refer to distinctions in number:

    much
    your > information
    that

    There is a general tendency for abstract nouns to be non-count.

    Determiners such as the and your can go with both count and non-count nouns.
    Others can go only with singular count nouns (a) or only with plural count nouns
    (those).

    Some nouns may be either count or non-count, depending on their meaning:

    There is not enough /ight in here. (non-count)
    We need another couple of lights. (count)
    Sandra does not have much difficulty with science. (non-count)
    Benjamin is having great difficulties with arithmetic. (count)

    Nouns that are ordinarily non-count can be converted into count nouns with two types of special use:

    1. When the count noun refers to different kinds:
    The shop has a large selection of cheeses.
    2. When the count noun refers to units that are obvious in the situation.

    I'll have two coffees, please. (‘two cups of coffee')

    90 An Introduction to English Grammar

    5.5 Number

    Count nouns make a distinction between singular and plural. The regular plural ends
    in -s. This inflection (grammatical suffix), however, is pronounced in one of three
    ways, depending on the sound immediately before it. Contrast these three sets:

    1. buses, bushes, churches, pages, diseases, garages
    2. sums, machines, days, toes
    3. tanks, patients, shocks, notes

    The plural inflection is pronounced as a separate syllable — spelled -es — when it
    follows any of the sounds that appear in the singulars of the words listed in (1); in
    the case of diseases and garages, a final -e is already present in the singular, so only
    an -s needs to be added in the plural. When -s is added to form the plurals oes in
    (2) and notes in (3), the -es is not pronounced as a separate syllable. There are also
    some other exceptions to the usual -s spelling. (See also A.4 in the Appendix.)
    There are a few irregular plurals that reflect older English forms:

    man — men mouse — mice

    woman — women louse — lice

    foot — feet brother — brethren (in special senses)
    goose — geese child — children

    tooth — teeth ox — oxen

    There are a large number of classes of other irregular plurals, many of them
    having foreign plurals (e.g. stimulus — stimult; curriculum — curricula; crisis — crises).

    5.6 Gender

    Relatively few nouns are distinguished in gender, but there are some male nouns
    and female nouns; for example:

    father — mother widower — widow
    boy — girl bridegroom — bride
    host — hostess bull — cow

    hero — heroine lion — lioness

    Important distinctions in gender, however, apply to the third-person singular
    pronouns he, she, and it (cf. 5.18).

    When "He or she refers to a noun, the sex of the specific person or animal is made manifest (but see 8.6):

    The student was absent today because she attended an interview for a job.

    5.7 Case

    Nouns make a distinction in case: a distinction that is based on the grammatical function of the noun. Nouns have two cases: the common case and the genitive case. The common case is the one that is used ordinarily. The genitive case generally indicates that the noun is dependent on the noun that follows it; this case often corresponds to a structure with of:

    Jane's reactions — the reactions of Jane
    For regular nouns the genitive is indicated in writing by an apostrophe plus s (student's) in the singular and by an apostrophe following the plural -s inflection in the plural (students'):

    singular plural
    common case the student the students
    genitive case the student's essay the students' essays

    In speech, three of these forms are pronounced identically.
    Irregular nouns, however, distinguish all four forms in speech as well as in writing:
    singular plural
    common case the child the children
    genitive case the child's toy the children's toys

    The same genitive inflection ('s) is attached to both the singular and the plural.
    On the rules for placing the apostrophe after words ending in -s, see 9.13.

    5.8 Dependent and independent genitives

    Genitives may be dependent or independent. The dependent genitive functions like a possessive determiner (cf. 5.19). Compare:

    the student's essay (dependent genitive)
    his essay (possessive determiner)

    The independent genitive is not dependent on a following noun. The noun may be omitted because it can be understood from the context:

    Your ideas are more acceptable than Sandra's. ("Sandra's ideas')
    David's comments are like Peter's. ((Peter's comments')

    But the independent genitive is also used to refer to places:

    The party is at Alan's tonight.
    She's gone to the hatrdresser's.

    92 An Introduction to English Grammar
    Finally, the independent genitive may combine with the of structure:

    a friend of Martha's
    a suggestion of Norman's

A friend of Martha''s.\n- **Part A**: Classify each sentence as using a dependent or independent genitive, and explain your reasoning.\n- **Part B**: In the second sentence (with the misspelled ''hatrdresser''), determine whether the genitive form is correctly used. Justify your answer based on the text''s explanation of genitive usage.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the independent genitive can combine with the ''of'' structure, using examples from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts of dependent and independent genitives, as well as the relationship between genitive forms and ''of'' structures.'

- prompt: |-
    The independent genitive in the of-structure differs from the normal genitive in its
    meaning: Martha's friend means ‘the friend that Martha has' (the speaker assumes
    that the hearer knows the identity of the friend), whereas a friend of Martha's
    means ‘one of the friends that Martha has'.

    MAIN VERBS

    5.9 Verb suffixes

    A main verb (or, more simply, a verb) is a word that can be the main word in a
    verb phrase and is often the only verb (cf. 4.11). Certain suffixes are added to
    nouns or adjectives to make main verbs. Here are a few common verb suffixes with
    words that exemplify them:

    -ate, -iate chlorinate, originate, differentiate
    -en darken, hasten, sadden

    -ify, -fy codify, falsify, beautify

    -ise, -ize apologise, publicise, rationalize

    Like nouns, very many verbs have no suffixes: write, walk, reveal, understand.
    Many of the suffixes that characterize verbs served that function in Latin or
    French, and so we have words in English that were already suffixed when they
    were borrowed from these languages: signify, realize.

    5.10 Regular and irregular verbs

    I earlier (4.12) distinguished five forms of verbs. In all regular verbs (such as laugh)
    and in many irregular verbs (such as fear) forms 4 and 5 below are identical. In one
    set of irregular verbs (e.g. cut) forms 1, 4, and 5 are identical. The full set of five
    forms appears in the irregular verb speak.

    1. base form: laugh hear cut speak

    2. -s form: laughs hears cuts speaks
    3. -ing participle: laughing hearing cutting speaking
    4. past form: laughed heard cut spoke

    5. -ed participle: laughed heard cut spoken

    The highly irregular verb be has eight forms (cf. 4.12).

    There are over 250 irregular verbs in English. Apart from the verb de, the -s form
    and the -zmg participle can be predicted for all verbs from the base form. We
    therefore need list only three forms to show irregularities: the base, past, and -ed
    participle. These three forms are known as the principal parts of the verb. If we
    leave aside the verb be, we can group the irregular verbs into seven classes accord-
    ing to whether or not three features apply to their principal parts: (a) the past and
    -ed participles are identical; (b) the base vowel is the same in the other two
    principal parts; (c) the past and -ed participle have inflectional endings. If an
    irregular verb has inflectional endings, these may be irregular; for example, kept
    from keep or spoken from speak.

    Table 5.1 sets out in columns the three features and shows whether they apply
    (‘+') or not (‘—') to each of the seven classes of irregular verbs. The ‘+' for class II
    indicates that some verbs in the class do not have the specified feature. The ‘'/2' for
    class IV indicates that the verbs have an inflectional ending in the participle
    (spoken) but not in the past (spoke).

    I give further examples of irregular verbs in each of the classes.

    Class I bend bent bent earn earnt earnt
    build built built learn learnt learnt
    have had had smell smelt smelt
    make made made spoil spoilt sporlt

    Those in the second column also have regular variants: earn, earned, earned.

    Class II mow mowed mown shear sheared shorn
    show showed shown swell swelled swollen

    The past is formed regularly, but the participle has an -v inflection. Those in the

    second column have a different vowel in the participle, hence ‘+' in the table. All
    the verbs have regular variants for the participle: mow, mowed, mowed.

    Word Classes

    ADJECTIVES

    5.12 Adjective suffixes

    An adjective is a word that can be the only or main word in an adjective phrase
    (cf. 4.21). A large number of suffixes are added to nouns and verbs to make
    adjectives. Here are the most common suffixes and words that exemplify them:

    -able, -ible disposable, suitable, fashionable, audible
    -al, -1al normal, cynical, racial, editorial

    -ed wooded, boarded, wretched, crooked

    -ful hopeful, playful, careful, forgetful

    16 romantic, atmospheric, heroic, atomic

    -1cal lustorical, political, paradoxical, economical
    -ish amateurish, darkish, foolish, childish

    -1ve, -alive defective, communicative, attractive, affirmative
    -less tactless, hopeless, harmless, restless

    -OuS, —COUS, -10US famous, virtuous, erroneous, spacious

    -y tasty, handy, wealthy, windy

    The suffix -ed is often used to form adjectives from noun phrases: blue-eyed,
    long-haired, goodnatured, open-minded.

    Like nouns and verbs, many adjectives have no suffixes: sad, young, happy, true.
    Some suffixes were part of the words when they were borrowed into English:
    sensitive, virtuous.

    5.13. Adjective classes

    We can divide adjectives into three classes according to their function. Used alone
    or with one or more modifiers, an adjective can be:

    1. pre-modifier of a noun
    2. subject complement
    3. object complement

    Adjectives are attributive (attributing a quality to what is denoted by a noun)
    when they are being used as pre-modifiers. They are predicative (part of the
    predicate) when they are being used as complements.

    Central adjectives can be used in all three functions:

    1. It was a comfortable ride. attributive
    2. The ride was comfortable. predicative
    3. I made the bed comfortable. predicative

    Other examples of central adjectives include: clever, brave, calm, hungry, noisy.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Adjective Suffixes and Functions**\n\nExamine the adjectives in the following sentences and identify their class (pre-modifier, subject complement, or object complement), as well as the suffixes used (if any):\n1. The *fashionable* dress was very stylish.\n2. She appeared *young* and *harmless*.\n3. He made the car *comfortable*.\n\n**Task**:\n- For each sentence, determine the function of the adjective and list any suffixes present.\n- Explain why *comfortable* can function as both a pre-modifier and a subject complement (as in "The *comfortable* car was noisy.").\n- Compare the suffixes of *fashionable* and *harmless* to highlight how they reflect different semantic roles.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of both adjective suffixes and their grammatical functions, as detailed in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Adjective Suffixes**\n\nConsider the following adjectives and their suffixes: *sensitive*, *virtuous*, *tactless*, *harmless*, and *romantic*.\n- **Part A**: Classify each adjective as either a "borrowed" word (with suffixes part of the original meaning) or a "derived" adjective (with suffixes added for modification). Justify your classification using the text''s explanation of suffixes.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the suffix *-ous* in *virtuous* and *famous* contributes to the meaning of these adjectives. Use examples from the text to support your reasoning.\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument that *-ed* suffix adjectives (e.g., *wretched*, *crooked*) are more likely to be used as pre-modifiers than as subject complements. Use the text''s discussion of adjective functions to back your claim.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s analysis of adjective suffixes and their grammatical roles.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving with Adjective Classes**\n\nThe text discusses three classes of adjectives: pre-modifiers, subject complements, and object complements. Imagine a scenario where a character in a story is described using adjectives from all three classes.\n- **Part A**: Write a sentence that includes an adjective as a pre-modifier, a subject complement, and an object complement.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the sentence you created to show how each adjective functions according to the text''s classification.\n- **Part C**: Modify the sentence to include a centralized adjective (like *comfortable* or *brave*) that can function in all three classes. Explain the flexibility this provides in narrative description.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate creative application of the text''s adjective classes and their functional distinctions.'

Explain why each example fits its designated classification, referencing specific rules from the text (e.g., ''Predicative adjectives must be followed by a post-modifier...'').\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentences must be grammatically correct and clearly demonstrate the application of the text''s grammar rules.'

- prompt: |-
    The superlatives in (1b) and (3b) are required when the comparison involves more than two units or sets of units.

    Higher degrees of comparison are expressed either through the inflections -er and -est or through the pre-modifiers more and most:

    absolute comparative superlative
    inflection polite politer poltest
    pre-modifier polite more polite most polite

    Some very common adjectives have irregular inflections:

    absolute comparative superlative
    good better best

    bad worse worst

    far farther/ further farthest/ furthest

    Words of one syllable generally take inflections: older, oldest, purer, purest. Many
    words of two syllables can usually take either form: politer, politest or more polite, most
    polite, noisier, noisiest or more noisy, most noisy. Words with more than two syllables
    take the pre-modifiers: more important, most important; more expensive, most expensive.

    ADVERBS

    5.15 Adverb suffixes
    An adverb is a word that can be the only or main word in an adverb phrase (cf.
    4.23). The suffix -ly is commonly added to adjectives to make adverbs:
    calmly, frankly, lightly, madly, quietly, tearfully
    If the adjective ends in -ic, the suffix is usually -ically:

    economically, geographically, heroically, romantically

    The exception is publicly.
    The suffix -wise is added to nouns to make adverbs:

    clockwise, lengthwise, moneywise, weatherwise

    Like the other word classes, many adverbs have no suffixes. These include, in
    particular, most time adverbs (now, today, yesterday, tomorrow), space adverbs
    (here, there, outside, inside), and 'linking adverbs' (therefore, however).

    Like adjectives, adverbs are typically gradable and can therefore be modified by
    intensifiers and take comparison (cf. 5.14): quite calmly, very calmly, less calmly,
    most calmly. Most adverbs that take comparison require the pre-modifiers more and
    most. Those adverbs that have the same form as adjectives have the inflections (e.g.
    late — later — latest). The following adverbs have irregular inflections; the first three
    are identical with those for adjectives:

    well better best

    badly worse worst

    far farther/ further farthest/ furthest
    little less least

    much more most

    PRONOUNS

    5.17 Pronoun classes

    Pronouns are essentially special types of nouns and are the main word in a noun
    phrase or (more usually) the only word in a noun phrase. They fall into a number
    of classes, here listed with examples:

    Word Classes

    1. personal pronouns I, you, we, they

    2. possessive pronouns my, mine, your, yours
    3. reflexive pronouns myself, yourself

    4. demonstrative pronouns this, these, that, those
    5. reciprocal pronouns each other, one another
    6. interrogative pronouns who, what, which

    7. relative pronouns which, who, that

    8. indefinite pronouns some, none

    The first three classes are related in that they make distinctions in person (first,
    second, third), gender (masculine, feminine, and non-personal), and number
    (singular and plural). Most of them also share at least some resemblance in their
    sound and in their appearance (you, yours, yourself).

    Pronouns generally substitute for a noun phrase:

    I went around the hospital with Dr Thomas. He was highly intelligent,
    austere, and warm all at the same time. He could perceive almost instantly whether a problem was a serious one or not.

    The two instances of He refer back to an antecedent (something that came
    before), in this instance Dr Thomas. The pronouns are used to avoid repeating the
    noun phrase Dr Thomas. One, however, replaces the noun head problem (and
    therefore is literally a pronoun rather than a substitute for a noun phrase). Here is
    another example of pronoun substitution:

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Adverb Modification and Comparison**\n\nUsing the information provided about adverbs in the text, create a sentence that demonstrates the use of intensifiers and comparison forms for an adverb. For example, if you choose ''calmly'', construct a sentence like: "She spoke *very calmly* and *more calmly* than her sister."\n- **Step 1**: Select an adverb from the list provided (calmly, well, badly, far, little, much).\n- **Step 2**: Apply intensifiers (very, quite) and comparison forms (more, most, less, least) to the adverb.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the chosen adverb''s inflection pattern (e.g., ''well'' → ''better'' → ''best'') aligns with the text''s explanation of adverb inflections.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must include at least two intensifiers and one comparison form, and your explanation must reference the text''s discussion of adverb inflection patterns.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Pronoun Classes**\n\nIdentify the pronoun class for each of the following sentences and explain your reasoning based on the text''s classification system:\n1. "I went around the hospital with Dr Thomas."\n2. "He could perceive almost instantly whether a problem was a serious one or not."\n3. "One, however, replaces the noun head problem (and therefore is literally a pronoun rather than a substitute for a noun phrase)."\n- **Part A**: For each sentence, determine the pronoun class (e.g., personal, possessive, demonstrative).\n- **Part B**: Explain how the pronoun functions in terms of substitution or reference to an antecedent, as described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly align each pronoun with its class and provide justification based on the text''s definitions.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Pronoun Substitution and Classification**\n\nConstruct a sentence that demonstrates the use of pronouns in substitution, using at least two different pronoun classes as described in the text. For example: "She (personal pronoun) gave him (possessive pronoun) the book."\n- **Step 1**: Choose two pronouns from different classes (e.g., personal and possessive).\n- **Step 2**: Create a sentence where each pronoun substitutes for a noun phrase.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the choice of pronoun classes reflects the text''s discussion on pronoun substitution and reference.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must include at least two distinct pronoun classes, and your explanation must reference the text''s classification of pronouns.

- prompt: |-
    A property development company has been found guilty of racial discrimination because it attempted to prevent blacks from buying its homes.

    In this case the pronoun it replaces a noun phrase that is not identical with the antecedent noun phrase A property development company. If we did not substitute it, we would have to write the property development company (with the definite article the) or (more economically) the company.

    The pronoun occasionally comes before its antecedent:

    When she moved into her own flat, Helen seemed much more relaxed.
    If we assume that the pronoun she and Helen refer to the same person, she and the possessive determiner her (cf. 5.19) both refer forward to Helen.

    Pronouns can also refer directly to something that is present in the situation:

    Look at that!
    Pick it up.

    5.18 Personal pronouns

    All the personal pronouns have distinctions in person (first, second, third). Most also have distinctions in number (singular, plural) and in case (subjective, objective, genitive). For the genitive case of the personal pronouns, see the possessive determiners (5.19).

    subjective case objective case
    first person
    singular I me
    plural we us
    second person
    singular/plural you you
    third person
    singular — masculine he him
    — feminine she her
    — non-personal it it
    plural they them

    The subjective case applies when the pronouns are the subject of a finite clause:
    I know that she lives in Coventry and that he lives in Birmingham.

    In all other instances except the one that I am about to mention, the objective case is used:

    She knows me well.
    He has told her about me.

    You must go with Aum.

    The exception is that the subjective case is also used for the subject complement. In these examples the complement follows the linking verb be:

    This is he.
    It was he who issued the order.

    In non-formal style, however, the objective case is common here too:
    It's him.

    The masculine and feminine genders apply to human beings and also to other beings that are treated as persons, such as pets or perhaps some farm animals. The

Use the text''s examples to support your explanation.\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence that intentionally uses the genitive case (possessive form) of a pronoun. Explain how this relates to possessive determiners as mentioned in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of pronoun gender, case, and possessive forms as defined in the text.'

- prompt: |-
    The distinction between the two genders is made on the basis of natural distinctions in sex. Some other objects (such as ships or cars) or even personified abstractions (such as Death or Beauty) may be treated as if they were persons. Otherwise, the non-personal pronoun z/ is used. One exceptional use of zt is for babies whose sex is unknown to the speaker.

    The personal pronouns take modifiers to a limited extent:

    you who know me we in this country
    you there they both

    5.19 Possessives

    The possessive pronouns are the genitives of the personal pronouns. There are two sets. One set contains the possessive determiners, a subclass of determiners (cf. 5.26f.). A possessive determiner is dependent on a noun:

    Here is your book.

    The other set of possessives contains the possessive pronouns, a subclass of pro-
    nouns. A possessive pronoun functions independently:

    This book is yours.

    The possessive determiners are not pronouns, but it is convenient to deal with
    them in this section because of the parallels between the two sets of possessives.
    Nouns in the genitive case also have these two functions (cf. 5.7):

    This is David's book. (dependent genitive)
    This book is David's. (independent genitive)

    But unlike the nouns, most of the possessives have separate forms for the depen-
    dent and independent functions. The two sets of forms parallel the forms for the
    personal pronouns (cf. 5.18).

    Dependent Independent
    first person
    singular my mine
    plural our ours

    second person
    singular/plural your yours

    third person

    singular — masculine his his
    — feminine her hers
    — non-personal its —
    plural their theirs

    5.20 Reflexive pronouns

    The reflexive pronouns parallel the personal and possessive pronouns in person
    and number, but have no distinctions in case. There are separate forms for the
    second person singular ( yourself) and plural ( yourselves), whereas there is only one
    form of the second person for the personal pronoun (you) and the possessive
    pronoun (yours).

    first person
    singular myself
    plural ourselves

    second person
    singular yourself

    plural yourselves

    — feminine herself

    — non-personal itself
    plural themselves

    The reflexive pronouns have two main uses:

    1. They refer to the same person or thing as the subject does:
    They behaved themselves for a change.
    You'll hurt yourself:

    2. They give emphasis to a noun phrase:
    She herself spoke to me.
    He wrote to me fimself.
    I appealed to the captain himself.

    5.21 Demonstrative pronouns

    There are four demonstrative pronouns:

    singular this that
    plural these those
    Word Classes

    This is for you.

    That doesn't make sense.
    These are tasty.

    You may take those.

    The demonstratives may also be determiners (cf. 5.26f):

    This letter is for you.

    That sign doesn't make sense.
    These biscuits are tasty.

    You may take those boxes.

    5.22 Reciprocal pronouns

    There are two reciprocal pronouns, and they have genitives:

    each other one another
    each other's one another's

    The partners trusted each other completely.
    My brother and I borrow one another's clothes.

    5.23 Interrogative pronouns

    One set of the interrogative pronouns has distinctions in gender and case:

    subjective case objective case genitive case
    personal who whom whose

    It is normal to use who for both the subjective and objective cases, and to reserve
    whom for formal style (cf. 8.18). The other interrogative pronouns, which and what,
    have only one form. Which, what, and whose may also be determiners (cf. 5.26f.).
    We use who and whom when we refer to persons:

    Who is your favourite pop singer?
    Who (or whom) have they appointed?
    Whose is that towel?

    Which can be either personal or non-personal:

    Which is your sister?
    Which (of the drinks) do you prefer?

    103
    104 An Introduction to English Grammar
    What is normally only non-personal:
    What do you want?

    5.24 Relative pronouns

    Relative pronouns introduce relative clauses (cf. 4.5). They also have distinctions
    in gender and case:

    subjective case objective case genitive case

    personal who whom whose
    non-personal which which whose
    that that

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Reflexive Pronoun Uses**\n\nConsider the sentences: "They behaved themselves for a change." and "You''ll hurt yourself."\n- **Part A**: Explain the difference in meaning between the two sentences, focusing on the role of ''yourself'' as a reflexive pronoun.\n- **Part B**: Create a new sentence that uses ''themselves'' in the second use (emphasizing a noun phrase), and explain how it illustrates this grammatical function.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly differentiate the two uses of reflexive pronouns and demonstrate an understanding of their distinct roles in sentence structure.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Demonstrative Pronouns**\n\nConstruct two sentences using the demonstratives ''this'' and ''those'', each with a different grammatical function (determiner vs. pronoun).\n- **Part A**: For each sentence, identify whether the demonstrative is functioning as a determiner or a pronoun.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the placement of the demonstrative (e.g., before or after the noun) affects its grammatical role in each sentence.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must correctly identify the grammatical function of each demonstrative and explain the relationship between placement and role.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Interrogative and Relative Pronouns**\n\nThe text distinguishes between interrogative pronouns (who, whom, whose, which, what) and relative pronouns (who, whom, whose, which, that).\n- **Part A**: Create a sentence using each of the pronouns in their correct grammatical roles.\n- **Part B**: Explain why ''who'' and ''whom'' are used differently in the following sentences:\n  - "Who is your favourite pop singer?"\n  - "Who (or whom) have they appointed?"\n- **Part C**: Provide an example of a relative clause using ''that'' and another using ''which'', explaining how the difference in usage reflects their grammatical functions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the distinctions between interrogative and relative pronouns, including their grammatical roles and usage conventions.'

- prompt: |-
    As with the interrogative pronouns (cf. 5.23), who is the normal form for the
    subjective and objective cases, whereas whom is used only in formal style. The
    relative pronoun that, which is gender-neutral, may be omitted in certain circum-
    stances. The omitted pronoun is sometimes called the zero relative pronoun.

    the teacher who (or that) taught me Chemistry

    the house which (or that or zero) we bought

    the person whom (or, less formally, who, that, or zero) they appointed
    the student to whom you gave it (formal)

    the student who (or that or zero) you gave it to

    Genitive whose is a determiner, like fis or her.

    There is another set of relative pronouns that introduce nominal relative
    clauses (cf. 6.9); these are the nominal relative pronouns. In addition to who,
    whom, and which, they include whoever, whomever (in formal style), whichever,
    what, and whatever.

    You may take what/whatever/ whichever you wish
    What I need is a long holiday.
    Pll speak to whoever is in charge.

    Nominal relative pronouns correspond to a combination of a relative pronoun
    with a preceding antecedent (cf. 5.17):

    What I need... (‘the thing that I need')
    ... to whoever is in charge (‘to the person who is in charge')
    5.25 Indefinite pronouns and numerals

    Indefinite pronouns are the largest group of pronouns. They refer to the presence
    (or absence) of a quantity. Here are some examples of indefinite pronouns:
    Word Classes

    Many have replied to the advertisement and several have been interviewed.
    You take one and Ill take the other.

    No one was absent today.

    More will be arriving later.

    You can have both.

    Either will do for me.

    There are fewer here today.

    Everybody was pleased with the speech.

    The some-set of indefinite pronouns contrasts with the any-set:

    some any
    someone anyone
    somebody anybody
    something anything

    The any-set is normal in negative contexts. Contrast:

    She has some close friends.
    She doesn't have any close friends.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Relative Pronouns in Sentences**\n\nConstruct a sentence using the relative pronoun ''whoever'' that conveys both a conditional and a causal relationship. For example: ''The person \\_ whom you trust will help you.''\n- **Task**: Replace the blank with ''whoever'' and include a clause that demonstrates the conditional (if/whether) and causal (because of) relationship.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the antecedent for ''whoever''.\n- **Step 2**: Form a conditional clause that depends on the antecedent.\n- **Step 3**: Add a causal result clause that logically follows from the condition.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must correctly use ''whoever'' with a nominal relative clause structure and demonstrate both conditional and causal logic.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Distinguishing Relative Pronouns in Sentences**\n\nAnalyze the following sentences and identify the correct relative pronoun form for each blank. Provide reasoning based on grammatical rules from the text:\n1. The person \\_\'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Indefinite Pronouns in Context**\n\nCompose a sentence using the indefinite pronoun ''either'' that conveys an exclusive choice between two options, and another sentence using ''any'' in a negative context.\n- **Task 1**: Use ''either'' to express that only one of two options is acceptable.\n- **Task 2**: Use ''any'' in a negative sentence to imply the absence of a specific quantity.\n- **Step 1**: Determine the context for each pronoun.\n- **Step 2**: Construct the sentences based on grammatical rules for indefinite pronouns.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentences must correctly apply ''either'' in an exclusive context and ''any'' in a negative context, demonstrating understanding of the distinction between some-set and any-set pronouns.'

    Some implies a quantity, though the quantity is not specified. Any does not imply
    a specific quantity; the quantity is without limit. The any-set is also normal in
    questions unless a positive reply is expected:

    Did anyone call for me?
    Did someone call for me?

    Two uses of indefinite one deserve special mention:
    1. Generic one has the meaning ‘people in general':

    If one is concerned about the increasing deterioration of the environment,
    one must be prepared to accept a lower standard of living.

    2. Substitute one is used as a substitute for a noun:

    A: Do you want an ice cream?
    B: I'll have a small one.

    Unlike most pronouns, one in the response by B substitutes for a noun, not a noun
    phrase. It is the main word in the noun phrase a small one.

    Many of the indefinite pronouns may be post-modified. Of-phrases are particu-
    larly common:

    105

    106 An Introduction to English Grammar

    somebody else neither of us
    several in our group none of the people
    something quite funny a few of my friends

    Numerals may be used as pronouns. Here are two examples of cardinal nu-
    merals as pronouns:

    Twenty-two were rescued from the sinking ship.
    Three of the children wandered off on their own.

    The ordinal numerals (first, second, third, ....) combine with the in this function:

    The first of my children is still at school.

    DETERMINERS

    5.26 Classes of determiners

    Determiners introduce noun phrases. The three classes of determiners are defined
    by the order in which they come:

    1. pre-determiners
    2. central determiners
    3. post-determiners

    Here is an example with determiners from each class:
    all (1) those (2) other (3) people

    Many words may be either determiners or pronouns:

    pronoun Some have left.
    determiner Some people have left.
    pronoun I need more.

    determiner I need more money.
    pronoun All are forgiven.
    determiner All faults are forgiven.
    pronouns You may borrow this.
    determiner You may borrow this pencil.

    5.27 Central determiners

    The central determiners fall into several subclasses.

    [7] Patrick intends to marry an Australan.

    It may mean that Patrick has a specific person in mind (perhaps unknown to the
    speaker), or that he has the ambition to marry someone from Australia though he
    has nobody in mind at present.

    As we will shortly see, both the indefinite article a and the definite article the are
    readily available for specific reference. For non-specific reference, indefinite a is
    usual but definite the also occurs:

    [8] Patrick intends to marry the first Australian he meets.

    Generic reference is always non-specific. Some non-generic reference may also
    be non-specific, as in [6] and [8].

    Definite/indefinite reference

    The definite article the is used to signal that a noun phrase is definite. Noun
    phrases are definite when they are intended to convey enough information to
    identify what they refer to. If they are not so intended, they are indefinite. The
    identification may come from several sources:

    1. The phrase refers to something uniquely identifiable by the speaker and
    hearer from their general knowledge or from their knowledge of the particular
    situation:

    the sun; the sea; the Church
    The Prime Minister is speaking on the radio this evening.
    I must feed the dog.

    The door is locked.
    The boss wants you.

    Word Classes

    2. The phrase may refer to something mentioned previously:

    Nancy introduced me to a young man and his wife at the reception. The

    young man was her nephew.

    At the first mention of the young man, the sentence refers to him by the
    indefinite phrase a young man.

    3. The information may be identified by modifiers in the noun phrase:

    I wonder whether you would mind getting for me the blue book on the
    top shelf

    Noun phrases may be definite even though they are not introduced by the
    definite article. For example, in a particular situation, personal pronouns (I, you,
    etc.) and names are uniquely identifiable and so are the demonstrative pronouns
    (cf. 5.21). Other determiners, such as the demonstrative determiners (cf. 5.27),
    may also signal that the noun phrase is definite.

    5.29 Pre-determiners
    There can also be pre-determiners before the central determiners. These include

    the multipliers (double, twice, three times, . . .) and the fractions (half, one-third, . . . )

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Definite and Indefinite Reference**\n\nIn the example [8] ''Patrick intends to marry the first Australian he meets,'' explain why the definite article ''the'' is used here, contrasting it with the use of ''a'' in example [6].\n- **Step 1**: Identify the type of reference (specific or non-specific) in both examples.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the definition of definite reference from the text (something uniquely identifiable by speaker/hearer).\n- **Step 3**: Justify why ''the'' is appropriate in [8] but not in [6].\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly distinguish between specific and non-specific reference using the definitions provided in the text, and highlight the role of unique identification in choosing ''the'' over ''a''.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Pre-determiners**\n\nConsider the sentence ''I bought three times as much as you.'' According to the text, pre-determiners like ''three times'' can precede central determiners.\n- **Part A**: Identify the pre-determiner in this sentence and explain its function.\n- **Part B**: Create a similar sentence using ''half'' as a pre-determiner.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the use of pre-determiners (like ''three times'') affects the definiteness of a noun phrase.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of pre-determiners as described in the text, using examples that clearly show their role in modifying determiners and influencing definiteness.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Noun Phrases**\n\nThe text describes that noun phrases can be definite without the definite article, as in personal pronouns or demonstratives. Using this concept, analyze the following sentence: ''The dog is barking.''\n- **Part A**: Determine whether this noun phrase is definite or indefinite based on the text''s criteria.\n- **Part B**: Compare it with a sentence like ''Dog is barking.'' Explain why the definite article is necessary in the first case.\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence using a demonstrative pronoun (e.g., ''that'') that is definite without the article.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reflect a clear understanding of when a noun phrase is considered definite, even without the article, based on the text''s definitions and examples.'

    They also include the words all, both, such, and what:

    Such is exceptional in that it can combine with other pre-determiners (a// such
    jokes) and can come after a central determiner (no such jokes) and even a post-
    determiner (many such jokes).

    5.30 Post-determiners

    Post-determiners can come after the central determiners. They include the car-
    dinal numerals and the ordinal numerals:

    AUXILIARIES

    5.31 Classes of auxiliaries

    Auxiliaries come before the main verb in a verb phrase. The primary auxiliaries
    are be, have, and do. They are different from each other and from the other
    auxiliaries. Their uses are:

    1. befor (a) the progressive: was playing (cf. 4.14)
    (b) the passive: was played (cf. 4.15)

    2. have for the perfect: has played (cf. 4.14)

    3. doas the dummy operator: did play (cf. 4.17)

    The remaining auxiliaries are the modal auxiliaries or, more simply, the
    modals. The central modals are:

    present can may will shall must
    past could might would should

    Like other verbs, most of the modals have a tense distinction between present and
    past (the exception being must), but the past forms are often used for present or
    future time:

    We may/ might come along after dinner.
    I can/ could help you later.

    There are two classes of conjunctions:

    1. coordinating conjunctions, or coordinators
    2. subordinating conjunctions, or subordinators

    The central coordinators are and, or, and but. They are used to link units of
    equal status:

    I enjoy novels and short stories best of all

    I can and will speak!

    The device seals a plastic shopping bag and equips it with a handle.
    You may pay by cash or credit card.

    He was apologetic but he refused to intervene.

    The coordinators may be reinforced by correlative expressions: both... and;
    either... or; not only... but also:

    both Susan and her brother
    either tea or coffee
    Not only was the speech uninspiring, but it was also full of illogical
    statements.
    The marginal coordinator nor may be reinforced by the correlative neither:

    I have neither seen the movie nor read the book.

    Subordinators introduce subordinate clauses (cf. 6.9):

    111

    112. An Introduction to English Grammar

    The negotiations succeeded because both sides bargained in good faith.
    If you like the service, tell the manager.

    Here are some common subordinators:

    after before till where
    although if unless while
    as since until
    because that when

    Some subordinators consist of more than one word: except that and as long as, for
    example.

    Some words are both subordinators and prepositions. If the word introduces a
    finite clause, it is a subordinator; if it introduces a phrase, it is a preposition:

    subordinator I saw her after Lhad my interview.
    preposition I saw her after the interview.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Conjunction Usage**\n\nCreate a compound sentence using both a coordinating conjunction and a subordinating conjunction, incorporating at least two correlative expressions. Your sentence should demonstrate the ability to distinguish between coordinating and subordinating functions, as well as the use of correlative structures.\n- **Step 1**: Choose a coordinating conjunction (e.g., ''both... and'') and a subordinating conjunction (e.g., ''because'').\n- **Step 2**: Construct a sentence that uses both, ensuring the correlative expressions are logically connected.\n- **Step 3**: Justify the choice of conjunctions and correlative expressions based on their grammatical roles as described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must be grammatically correct and clearly demonstrate understanding of the different conjunction types as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Subordinators and Prepositions**\n\nExplain the difference between the subordinator ''after'' and the preposition ''after'' in the following sentences:\n1. I saw her after I had my interview.\n2. I saw her after the interview.\n- **Part A**: Identify which word in each sentence functions as a subordinator and which as a preposition.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the grammatical role of each in terms of clause structure and phrase function, referencing the text''s explanation of subordinators and prepositions.\n- **Part C**: Provide a real-life example where the distinction between subordinators and prepositions is critical for clarity.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly differentiate the two parts of speech and demonstrate understanding of their distinct functions as presented in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Correlative Constructions**\n\nWrite a paragraph (4-6 sentences) that uses at least three correlative expressions from the text. Your paragraph must:\n- **Part A**: Use each correlative expression in a distinct grammatical structure (e.g., ''both... and'', ''either... or'', ''not only... but also'').\n- **Part B**: Ensure the correlative expressions are logically connected to the main idea of the paragraph.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the use of correlative expressions enhances clarity and cohesion in your writing, referencing the text''s explanation of their function.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must be coherent, grammatically correct, and demonstrate an understanding of the purpose and structure of correlative expressions as described in the text.'

    Prepositions introduce a prepositional phrase, and are followed by a prepositional complement (cf. 4.25). The preposition links the complement to some other expression. If it links the complement to the rest of the sentence or clause, the prepositional phrase may be placed in any of various positions:

    We had an argument in the supermarket.

    All the members of the team, 77 my view, contributed equally to the victory.
    By that time I was feeling sleepy.

    It may also link the complement to a phrase:

    He became personal assistant to the managing director of the company.
    The government suppressed all information about the epidemic.

    Here are some common prepositions:

    about before during over until
    above behind for past up
    across below from since with
    after beside in than without
    against between inside through
    among(st) but into till

    around by off to

    Some definitions of literature say that it is language used for making fiction.
    — noun

    Other definitions say that it is language used for the purpose of pleasing
    aesthetically. — preposition

    However, some critics have shown convincingly that the two definitions are
    necessarily connected. — adverbs

    Certainly, the fiction definition alone is not sufficient, since some literature is
    not fiction (e.g. biography) and some fiction is not literature (e.g. the story told
    in an advertisement). — determiner

    Attempts to identify literary language through its abundance of rhetorical or
    figurative devices have also failed. — adjective

    Some have argued that it is a mistake to set up a dichotomy between literary
    and non-literary language, since literature is defined simply by what we as
    readers or literary critics regard as literature. — pronoun

    Sentences and Clauses

    6.1 Sentence types

    In 2.4 I listed the four major types of sentences that are associated with four major
    uses in communication:

    declaratives for statements
    interrogatives for questions
    imperatives for directives

    Fenn

    exclamatives for exclamations

    Most of the sentences that we have looked at so far have been declaratives. In the
    sections that follow we will examine the other three types of sentences.

    6.2 Questions

    There are two main types of interrogative sentences:

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Types and Grammar Concepts**\n\nIdentify the sentence type (declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamative) for each of the following sentences. For each identified sentence type, explain how it fits the grammatical function described in the text (e.g., "Declarative sentences are used to make statements...").\n\n1. ''It is remarkably difficult to define what literature is.''\n2. ''Some definitions of literature say that it is language used for making fiction.''\n3. ''However, some critics have shown convincingly that the two definitions are necessarily connected.''\n4. ''Certainly, the fiction definition alone is not sufficient...''\n5. ''Attempts to identify literary language through its abundance of rhetorical or figurative devices have also failed.''\n6. ''Some have argued that it is a mistake to set up a dichotomy between literary and non-literary language...''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must correctly classify each sentence and explicitly reference the grammatical function described in the text to justify your classification.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Word Classes and Their Functions**\n\nFor each underlined word in the following sentences, identify its part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, determiner, pronoun) based on the labels provided. For each identification, explain how the word functions within the sentence structure (e.g., ''language'' is a noun because it refers to a category of words...'').\n\n1. ''It is remarkably difficult to define what literature is.'' — main verb\n2. ''Some definitions of literature say that it is language used for making fiction.'' — noun\n3. ''Other definitions say that it is language used for the purpose of pleasing aesthetically.'' — preposition\n4. ''However, some critics have shown convincingly that the two definitions are necessarily connected.'' — adverbs\n5. ''Certainly, the fiction definition alone is not sufficient, since some literature is not fiction (e.g. biography) and some fiction is not literature (e.g. the story told in an advertisement).'' — determiner\n6. ''Some have argued that it is a mistake to set up a dichotomy between literary and non-literary language, since literature is defined simply by what we as readers or literary critics regard as literature.'' — adjective\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must correctly identify the part of speech for each underlined word and explicitly explain its grammatical function within the sentence.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Sentence Structure and Grammar**\n\nConsider the sentence: ''In 2.4 I listed the four major types of sentences that are associated with four major uses in communication: declaratives for statements, interrogatives for questions, imperatives for directives, and exclamatives for exclamations.''\n- **Part A**: Identify the main clause and the subordinate clauses in this sentence. For each clause, explain its grammatical function (e.g., ''The main clause is... because it contains the main verb...'').\n- **Part B**: Explain how the list structure (using commas and ''and'') contributes to the clarity of this sentence. Reference the text''s explanation of sentence types and their functions.\n- **Part C**: Construct a new sentence that follows the same structure as this one, but discusses a different topic (e.g., ''In 3.1 we discussed the three main parts of speech...'').\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must correctly analyze the sentence structure and demonstrate an understanding of how grammatical elements contribute to clarity and coherence in writing.'

- prompt: |-
    1. Yes—no questions begin with a verb. They require subject—operator inversion; that is, a reversal of the order of subject and verb (the order that is normal in declaratives). The verb that appears before the subject is an operator (cf. 3.3f):

    Should (op) the government (S) cut income taxes?
    Does (op) this shop (S) open 24 hours every day?

    They are called yes—no questions because they expect the answer yes or no. They
    may in fact be answered in other ways; for example, Certainly; Perhaps; I don't
    know; What do you think?

    2. Wh-questions begin with an interrogative word or phrase:

    Why should the government cut income taxes?
    On which days does this shop open 24 hours?

    They are called mh-questions because most of the interrogative words begin with m/-
    (the exception is how). The interrogative phrases contain an interrogative word
    such as which in On which days. The interrogative word in m/A-questions represents
    a missing piece of information that the speaker wants the hearer to supply.

    122 An Introduction to English Grammar

    Wh-questions generally require subject—operator inversion too. The exception
    occurs when the interrogative word or phrase is the subject, and in that case the
    normal subject—verb order applies:

    Who has taken my car?
    Which bus goes to Chicago?

    There are also several other types of questions.

    3. Declarative questions have the form of a declarative sentence but the force
    of a question. They are signalled by a rising intonation in speech and by a question
    mark in writing:

    You know my name?
    He's got the key?

    4. Alternative questions present two or more choices, and the hearer is
    expected to reply with one of them. One type of alternative question resembles the
    form of yes—no questions:

    Should the government reduce its deficit by raising income taxes or by
    cutting expenditure?

    The other type resembles m/-questions:
    Which do you want, coffee or tea?

    5. Tag questions are attached to sentences that are not interrogative. They
    invite the hearer to respond in agreement with the speaker:

    The government should cut income taxes, shouldn't it?
    You haven't said anything yet, have you?

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Yes-No and Wh-Questions\n\nCompare and contrast yes-no questions and wh-questions based on the definitions provided in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key characteristics of each type (e.g., structure, function, and expected responses).\n- **Step 2**: Provide examples for each type using the definitions from the text.\n- **Step 3**: Explain why subject-operator inversion is required in wh-questions but not when the interrogative word functions as the subject.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s definitions and clearly distinguish between the two question types based on their structural and functional properties.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Declarative and Alternative Questions\n\nExplain the difference between declarative questions and alternative questions using the definitions provided in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Define each question type based on their structural and functional characteristics (e.g., intonation, punctuation, and expected responses).\n- **Step 2**: Construct an example of each type that adheres to the text''s definitions.\n- **Step 3**: Analyze how alternative questions can be structured as either yes-no or wh-questions, using the text''s examples to support your argument.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s definitions and provide illustrative examples that align with the given explanations.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Tag Questions and Logical Reasoning\n\nEvaluate the grammatical correctness of the following tag questions based on the text''s definitions:\n1. The government should cut income taxes, shouldn''t it?\n2. You haven''t said anything yet, have you?\n- **Step 1**: Identify the main clause and the tag in each sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the tag functions according to the text''s definition of tag questions.\n- **Step 3**: Construct a new tag question that adheres to the text''s rules, ensuring that the main clause and tag are logically related.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly apply the text''s definitions and demonstrate a clear understanding of how tag questions function in English grammar.'

- prompt: |-
    Tag questions have the form of yes—no questions. They consist of an operator and
    a pronoun subject that echo the subject and operator of the sentence. The tag
    question is usually negative if the sentence is positive, and positive if the sentence
    is negative. Tag questions can be attached to imperative sentences; generally in
    these the subject is you and the operator is will:

    Don't tell him, will you?
    Make yourself at home, won't you?

    6. Rhetorical questions do not expect a reply since they are the equivalent of
    forceful statements. If the rhetorical question is positive it has negative force, and
    if it is negative it has positive force. The questions may resemble either yes—no
    questions or mh-questions:

    Is there anything more relaxing than a hot bath? (‘Surely there isn't . . .')
    Haven't you eyes? (‘Surely you have eyes.')
    Who could defend such a view? (‘Surely no one could .. .')

    6.3 Imperatives

    Imperative sentences usually do not have a subject. If there is no auxiliary, the verb
    has the base form:

    Take a seat.
    Pass me the bottle.
    Make me an offer.

    Modal auxiliaries do not occur with imperatives, and the only auxiliary that occurs
    with any frequency is passive be (usually in the negative):

    Don't be carried away with the idea.
    The pronoun you may be added as a second person subject:
    You make me an offer.
    Occasionally, a third person subject is used:

    Somebody make me an offer.
    Those in the front row sit down.

    First and third person imperatives may be formed with let and a subject:

    Let us go now.
    Let's not tell him.
    Don't /et's talk about it.

    Let me think what I should do.
    Let nobody move.

    6.4 Exclamatives

    Exclamatives begin with what or how. What introduces noun phrases; how is used
    for all other purposes. The exclamative word or (more commonly) phrase is
    fronted:
    124

    An Introduction to English Grammar

    What a good show it was! (‘It was an extremely good show.')
    What a time we've had!

    How hard she works!

    How strange they look!

    How time flies! ("Time flies extremely fast")

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: Is the sentence 'Don't tell him, will you?' an example of a tag question? Yes, it is. The sentence is positive and the tag is negative, which is the standard pattern for tag questions.
  finalExamQuestion2: Is 'Haven't you eyes?' a rhetorical question that has positive force? Yes, it is. The rhetorical question appears to be negative but actually expresses a positive meaning, as in 'Surely you have eyes.'
  finalExamQuestion3: Is the sentence 'Let's not tell him.' an example of a first person imperative with a modal auxiliary? No, it is not. The sentence uses 'Let's' which is a contraction of 'Let us,' and it does not include a modal auxiliary. Modal auxiliaries do not occur with imperatives, as stated in the text.

- prompt: |-
    Exclamative sentences express strong feeling. More specifically, they indicate the extent to which the speaker is impressed by something. What and how are intensifiers expressing a high degree.

    6.5 Speech acts

    When we say or write something, we are performing an action. This action expressed in words is a speech act. The intended effect in a speech act is the communicative purpose of the speech act.

    In Section 2.4 I referred to four major communicative uses associated with the four major types of sentences. We have already seen (cf. 6.2) that a sentence type may have a communicative use other than the one normally associated with it: a declarative question is a declarative sentence with the force of a question; a rhetorical question, on the other hand, is an interrogative sentence with the force of a statement.

    There are many more than four types of communicative purpose. Directly or indirectly, we may convey our intention to promise, predict, warn, complain, offer, advise, and so on. The communicative purpose of a speech act depends on the particular context in which the act is performed. Here are some sentences, together with plausible interpretations of their purpose if they are uttered as speech acts:

    It's getting late. (request for someone to leave with the speaker)
    Tell me your phone number. (inquiry — request for information)
    There is a prospect of heavy thunderstorms later in the day. (prediction)
    I'm afraid that I've broken your vase. (apology)

    Break it, and you'll pay for it. (warning)

    Do you want a seat? (offer)

    I nominate Tony Palmer. (nomination)

    Enjoy yourself. (wish)

    Don't touch. (prohibition)

    I won't be late. (promise)

    It would be a good idea to send a copy to the manager. (advice)

    The purpose may be merely to make a friendly gesture, where silence might be interpreted as hostility or indifference:

    It's a nice day, isn't it? (ostensibly information)
    How are you? (ostensibly an inquiry)

    6.6 Compound sentences

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Speech Acts and Communicative Purpose**\n\nConsider the sentence: "It''s a nice day, isn''t it?" Analyze this as a speech act based on the information provided in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the sentence type (interrogative) and its potential communicative purpose.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the sentence functions as a form of social interaction, referencing the concept of ''ostensibly information'' from the text.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this sentence might be used to convey a social intention rather than purely to inform.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the definitions of speech acts and communicative purposes from the text, showing an understanding of how context influences the intended effect.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Rhetorical and Declarative Questions**\n\nCompare the communicative purposes of a ''rhetorical question'' and a ''declarative question'' as described in the text.\n- **Part A**: Define each type using examples from the text.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how the structure of each sentence type influences their communicative purpose.\n- **Part C**: Provide a real-life example of each type and explain how their purpose differs in context.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the distinction between rhetorical and declarative questions, using clear examples from the text and real-world scenarios.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Speech Acts**\n\nCreate a scenario in which a speaker performs four different speech acts using the same sentence structure. For example:\n- **Speech Act 1**: Prediction (e.g., ''It''s going to rain tomorrow.'')\n- **Speech Act 2**: Warning (e.g., ''Don''t touch that.'')\n- **Speech Act 3**: Offer (e.g., ''Would you like a seat?'')\n- **Speech Act 4**: Apology (e.g., ''I''m sorry for the inconvenience.'')\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Design a fictional situation where these four speech acts are naturally integrated.\n- **Part B**: For each speech act, explain the communicative purpose and how it aligns with the definitions in the text.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how context and sentence structure determine the intended effect of each speech act.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must show a deep understanding of speech acts and their function in real-life communication, as described in the text.'

- prompt: |-
    A multiple sentence is a sentence that contains one or more clauses (structures that can be analysed in terms of sentence elements such as subject and predicate). If the multiple sentence consists of two or more coordinated clauses, it is a com-
    pound sentence. The coordinated clauses are normally linked by one of the
    coordinating conjunctions (and, or, but):

    [1] She is a superb administrator, and everybody knows that.

    [2] Lawns are turning green, flowers are blooming, and summer time is
    returning.

    [3] Send it to me by post or bring it around yourself.

    [4] They have played badly every year since 1998, but this year may be different.

    Compound sentences have two or more main clauses, each with independent
    status. We cannot therefore speak of, say, the subject of the sentence. In [1] for
    example, there is no subject of the sentence as a whole: the subject of the first main
    clause is she and the subject of the second main clause is everybody. In [2] there are
    three subjects of main clauses: lawns, flowers, and summer time.

    Instead of linking main clauses with a coordinator, we can often juxtapose them
    (place them side by side), and link them with a semicolon:

    [la] She is a superb administrator; everybody knows that.
    [4a] They have played badly every year since 1998; this year may be different.

    If we put a full stop between them, we have two orthographic sentences.

    We sometimes avoid repeating identical expressions across coordinated clauses
    by ellipsis (the omission of essential grammatical units that can be supplied by the
    hearer from the context):

    The adults ate chicken, the teenagers hamburgers, and the youngest chil-
    dren pizza. (The verb ate is omitted in the second and third clauses.)
    Last year we spent our holiday in Spain, the year before in Greece. (The
    expression we spent our holiday is omitted in the second clause.)

    6.7 Complex sentences

    A complex sentence is a multiple sentence in which one or more subordinate
    clauses are embedded:

    [1] Everybody knows that she is a superb administrator.
    [2] He saw the trouble that idle gossip can cause.
    [3] I am glad that you are joining our company.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Compound Sentence Construction\n\nConstruct a compound sentence that contains two main clauses, each with independent subjects and predicates. Your sentence must include at least one coordinating conjunction (and, or, but) and demonstrate an understanding of how to link clauses without using a semicolon.\n- **Part A**: Write the sentence, ensuring correct grammar and appropriate conjunction usage.\n- **Part B**: Explain why your sentence is a compound sentence, referencing the text''s definition of compound sentences as having two or more main clauses with independent status.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast your sentence with the example provided in the text: ''She is a superb administrator; everybody knows that.'' Highlight how your sentence differs in structure and purpose.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate comprehension of compound sentence structure and the use of coordinating conjunctions as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Analysis of Ellipsis in Sentences\n\nRevise the following sentence using ellipsis to avoid repeating the verb ''ate'' in all three clauses: ''The adults ate chicken, the teenagers ate hamburgers, and the youngest children ate pizza.''\n- **Part A**: Apply ellipsis to create a grammatically correct version of the sentence.\n- **Part B**: Explain how ellipsis functions in this context, referencing the text''s explanation of omitting essential grammatical units that can be inferred from context.\n- **Part C**: Compare your revised sentence with the example given in the text: ''Last year we spent our holiday in Spain, the year before in Greece.'' Discuss how both sentences use ellipsis but differ in their omitted elements.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must show an understanding of ellipsis as a grammatical device and its application in varying sentence structures.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Construction of Complex Sentences\n\nCreate a complex sentence that includes at least one subordinate clause. Your sentence must clearly demonstrate the relationship between the main clause and the subordinate clause, as outlined in the text.\n- **Part A**: Write the sentence, ensuring correct grammar and appropriate use of a subordinate conjunction (that, because, although).\n- **Part B**: Identify the main clause and the subordinate clause in your sentence, referencing the text''s definition of a complex sentence as containing one or more subordinate clauses.\n- **Part C**: Compare your sentence with the example provided in the text: ''I am glad that you are joining our company.'' Explain how your sentence differs in terms of the type of subordinate clause used and its function.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a thorough understanding of complex sentence structure and the role of subordinate clauses in connecting ideas.'

- prompt: "In [1] the clause functions as a sentence element: the direct object. In [2] it is  \na modifier in a phrase: the post-modifier of the noun trouble. In [3] it is also a  \nmodifier in a phrase: the post-modifier of the adjective glad.\n\nSubordinate clauses are often introduced by a subordinator (or subordinating  \nconjunction, cf. 5.33), particularly if the clauses are finite.\n\nA complex sentence can be analysed in terms of sentence elements such as  \nsubject and verb. In [1] the subject is Everybody, the verb is knows, and the direct  \nobject is the subordinate ¢hat-clause. In the subordinate clause, which is intro-  \nduced by the subordinator that, she is the subject, is is the verb, and a superb  \nadministrator is the subject complement.\n\n6.8 Non-finite and verbless clauses\n\nNon-finite and verbless clauses are generally subordinate clauses. Non-finite  \nclauses have a non-finite verb (cf. 4.18); verbless clauses are without a verb.\n\nThere are three types of non-finite clauses, depending on the form of the first  \nverb in the verb phrase:\n\n1. -ing clauses (or -ing participle clauses)\n\n[1] Just thinking about the final round put him in a combative mood.\n2. -ed clauses (or -ed participle clauses)\n\n[2] Dressed in street clothes, the patients strolled in the garden.\n3. infinitive clauses\n(a) with to\n\n[3] They wanted to pay for their meal.\n\n(b) without to\n\n[4] We helped unload the car.\n\nHere are two examples of verbless clauses:\n\n[5] Though fearful of the road conditions, they decided to go by car.\n\n[6] Weary and almost out of money, we drove into a petrol station off the  \nmotorway.\n\nNon-finite and verbless clauses can be regarded as reduced clauses, reduced in  \ncomparison with finite clauses. They often lack a subject, and verbless clauses also  \nlack a verb. However, we can analyse them in terms of sentence elements if we  \nreconstruct them as finite clauses, supplying the missing parts that we understand  \nfrom the rest of the sentence:\n\nThe text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Clause Function in Complex Sentences**\n\nIn the sentence "Everybody knows that she is a superb administrator," identify and explain the function of each clause (main and subordinate) based on the text''s explanation of sentence elements.\n- **Step 1**: Determine the main clause and its subject and verb.\n- **Step 2**: Identify the subordinate clause, noting the subordinator used (e.g., ''that'') and its internal structure (subject, verb, subject complement).\n- **Step 3**: Justify your analysis by referencing the text''s definition of sentence elements and clause types.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between the main and subordinate clauses, identify all components (subject, verb, etc.), and explicitly link your explanation to the text''s descriptions of sentence elements.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Identification and Analysis of Non-Finite Clauses**\n\nConsider the sentence "Dressed in street clothes, the patients strolled in the garden."\n- **Part A**: Identify the type of clause (non-finite) and explain its function in the sentence.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the clause using the text''s framework for non-finite clauses (e.g., -ed clauses, -ing clauses, or infinitive clauses).\n- **Part C**: Compare this clause to the verbless clause in [5] (''Though fearful of the road conditions, they decided to go by car'') and explain how both types of clauses function as reduced forms.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must correctly classify the clause, explain its grammatical function, and demonstrate understanding of how non-finite and verbless clauses differ in structure and usage.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Clause Reduction**\n\nThe text describes non-finite and verbless clauses as reduced forms of finite clauses. Construct a sentence that illustrates this concept, supplying the missing elements (subject and verb) as needed.\n- **Part A**: Write a sentence that includes a non-finite clause and a verbless clause.\n- **Part B**: Explain how each clause functions as a reduced form of a finite clause, using the text''s definitions.\n- **Part C**: Create a logical argument that uses both clause types to demonstrate how reduced clauses can convey complex meaning without explicit subject-verb structure.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include a constructed example, explanation of clause reduction, and an argument that demonstrates the utility of reduced clauses in English grammar.'

    [5c] They were fearful of the road conditions. (S + V + sC)

    Non-finite and verbless clauses may have their own subject:

    He began his speech nervously, /is voice (S) trembling.
    They trudged by the river in the deep snow, their heads and their hands (S)
    bare.

    If they do not have a subject, their subject is generally interpreted as being iden-
    tical in its reference with that of the subject of the sentence or clause in which they
    are embedded. This rule applies to sentences [2}-[6]. For [1] we deduce that the
    reference of the subject of thinking is identical with that of the object ham.

    Non-finite and verbless clauses are sometimes introduced by subordinators. In
    [5] the subordinator though introduces the verbless clause.

    We have seen (3.7—12) that the choice of the verb determines the choice of other
    sentence elements. For example, a transitive verb requires a direct object. The
    verb also determines the form of the element, including whether it allows a clause
    and what type of clause. For example, the transitive verb /zke may have as its direct
    object a noun phrase, an infinitive clause, or an -ing clause:

    vanilla ice cream.
    I like { to shop at Harrods.
    shopping at Harrods.

    The transitive verb prefer, on the other hand, takes as a direct object a noun phrase,
    an infinitive clause, an -7mg clause, or a that-clause:

    vanilla ice cream.
    to shop at Harrods.

    I preter shopping at Harrods.
    that we shop at Harrods.
    6.9 Functions of subordinate clauses

    Subordinate clauses have three main sets of functions:
    1. Nominal clauses have a range of functions similar to that for noun phrases
    (cf. 4.10). For example:

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Clause Types and Functions**\n\nAnalyze the sentence: "He began his speech nervously, /is voice (S) trembling."\n- **Part A**: Identify the clause type of each underlined phrase ("/is voice (S) trembling") and explain why it is classified as such.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the role of the non-finite clause "began his speech nervously" in relation to the verbless clause.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the functions of nominal clauses with those of subordinate clauses, using examples from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of clause types, their functions, and the relationships between different clause structures as defined in the text.'

    benefited the movie business.
    prepositional complement [listened to what the candidates had to say.

    Nominal relative clauses are clauses that are introduced by a nominal relative
    pronoun (cf. 5.24). Whereas relative clauses post-modify nouns, nominal relative
    clauses have the same functions as noun phrases:

    He gave his children what they wanted (dO).
    Whoever said that (S) does not understand the question.

    2. Modifier clauses function as modifiers in phrases. One common kind of
    modifier is the relative clause (cf. 4.5), which post-modifies a noun:

    Drugs that are used in chemotherapy damage a patient's healthy cells as well.

    Non-finite clauses function as reduced relative clauses:

    The firemen battled an inferno fuelled by toxic chemicals. (‘that was fuelled
    by...')

    Scientists found no evidence to suggest that neutrinos have mass. (‘that
    would suggest that . . .')

    I was engaged in a programme of research involving many chemical reac-
    tions. (‘that involved . . .')

    Another common kind of modifier is the comparative clause, which is introduced
    by than or as:

    She is a better doctor than I am.
    He spoke more rashly than he used to do.
    Norman played as fiercely as I expected.

    A third kind is a post-modifier of an adjective:
    Roger was afraid to tell his parents.

    3. Adverbial clauses function as the adverbial element in sentence or clause
    structure (cf. 3.9f):

    When a heart attack occurs, the electronic device automatically produces
    charges of electricity that jolt the heart back into a normal rhythm.

    Reflecting on the past three years, she wondered whether she could have
    made better choices.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structure Concepts**\n\nUsing the concepts from the text, analyze the sentence: ''When a heart attack occurs, the electronic device automatically produces charges of electricity that jolt the heart back into a normal rhythm.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify and label the main clauses in the sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Determine which clauses are adverbial and explain their function in the sentence structure.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your analysis by referencing specific text definitions, such as the role of adverbial clauses in sentence structure.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly identify the main and subordinate clauses, explain their functions, and explicitly reference the text''s discussion on adverbial clauses.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Modifier Clause Types**\n\nThe text discusses three types of modifier clauses: relative, comparative, and post-modifier of an adjective. Construct a sentence for each type using the following words: ''Roger was afraid to tell his parents.''\n- **Part A**: Relative clause (non-reduced form).\n- **Part B**: Comparative clause.\n- **Part C**: Post-modifier of an adjective.\n**Task**: For each sentence, clearly indicate the clause type and how it functions as a modifier according to the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentences must accurately reflect each clause type as defined in the text, and your explanations should directly reference the definitions provided.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Grammar Concepts**\n\nUsing the definitions from the text, evaluate the following statements: ''I believe that a hot, humid summer has benefited the movie business.'' and ''The firemen battled an inferno fuelled by toxic chemicals.''\n- **Part A**: Analyze the first sentence and determine if it contains a nominal relative clause. Justify your answer using the text''s definition of nominal relative clauses.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the second sentence and determine if it contains a non-finite clause. Explain how this is classified as a reduced relative clause according to the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct an example that combines both nominal and non-finite clauses, ensuring it meets the criteria for each clause type as defined in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must be based solely on the definitions provided, and your example must clearly demonstrate both clause types as described in the text.'

    The earlier division of multiple sentences into compound sentences and complex sentences (cf. 6.6f) is an oversimplification. It indicates at the highest level within the sentence a distinction between coordination and subordination of clauses. But these two types of clause linkage may mingle at lower levels. A compound sentence may have subordination within one of its main clauses. In this compound sentence, the second main clause is complex:

    [1] Mite specialists have identified 30,000 species of mites, but they believe that these represent only a tenth of the total number.

    In [1], but introduces a main clause and that introduces a subordinate clause within the main clause. The that-clause is subordinate to the but-clause and not to the sentence as a whole: the but-clause is superordinate to the subordinate that-clause.

    A complex sentence may contain a hierarchy of subordination:

    [2] They refused (A) to say (B) what they would do (C) if the strikers did not return to their jobs.

    In [2] each of the subordinate clauses extends from the parenthesized letter that marks it to the end of the sentence: (A) is a direct object that is subordinate to the sentence as a whole and superordinate to (B); (B) is a direct object that is subordinate to (A) and superordinate to (C); (C) is an adverbial clause that is subordinate to (B).

    The next example is a complex sentence whose subordinate clauses are coordinated:

    [3] They claimed that the streets are clean, the rubbish is regularly collected, and the crime rate is low.

    In [3] the three coordinated subordinate clauses together constitute the direct object of the sentence.

    In the final example, the compound sentence has both subordination and coordination at lower levels.

    [4] The Great Lake states warned pregnant women and nursing mothers to avoid eating certain Great Lakes fish, and they advised the rest of us to avoid certain large fatty species and to limit the consumption of other fish.

    The two main clauses are linked by and. The first main clause contains a non-finite subordinate clause (beginning to avoid) in which is embedded another non-finite subordinate clause (eating ... fish). The second main clause contains two

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Sentence Structure with Coordination and Subordination**\n\nExamine the sentence: *The Great Lake states warned pregnant women and nursing mothers to avoid eating certain Great Lakes fish, and they advised the rest of us to avoid certain large fatty species and to limit the consumption of other fish.*\n- **Part A**: Identify the main clauses in this sentence and explain how they are connected using coordination (and).\n- **Part B**: Within the first main clause, locate and describe the subordinate clause (beginning with to avoid). Classify this as a non-finite clause and explain its relationship to the main clause.\n- **Part C**: Determine if there is a hierarchical subordination within the second main clause and explain how the two subordinate clauses are connected (to avoid ... fish and to limit ... fish).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between coordination and subordination, and correctly identify clause relationships as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Hierarchy of Subordination in a Complex Sentence**\n\nConsider the sentence: *They refused (A) to say (B) what they would do (C) if the strikers did not return to their jobs.*\n- **Part A**: List the subordinate clauses in order of subordination hierarchy, starting with the most subordinate clause.\n- **Part B**: Explain how each subordinate clause is related to its superordinate clause, using the terms ''superordinate'' and ''subordinate'' as defined in the text.\n- **Part C**: Describe how the structure of this sentence reflects the concept of ''hierarchy of subordination'' as discussed in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of hierarchical clause relationships and correctly apply the terminology provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Complex Sentence Construction with Coordinated Subordinate Clauses**\n\nConstruct a complex sentence that contains three coordinated subordinate clauses functioning as the direct object of the main clause.\n- **Part A**: Write the sentence using a main verb such as *claim* or *state*.\n- **Part B**: Identify each subordinate clause and explain how they are coordinated (using words like ''and'', ''or'', etc.).\n- **Part C**: Compare your sentence to the example in the text (sentence [3]) and explain how your construction adheres to or differs from the example provided.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must be grammatically correct and demonstrate an understanding of coordinated subordinate clauses as discussed in the text.'

    6.11 There-structures

    In the remaining sections of this chapter we will examine some common structures
    that depart from the basic sentence patterns.

    The first is the there-structure. There is put in the subject position and the
    subject is moved forward to a later position:

    There is nobody outside. (cf. Nobody is outside.)

    There are some topics that are best discussed in private. (cf. Some topics
    are best discussed in private.)

    There are several countries that have asked the Secretary-General for an
    emergency session of the Security Council.

    There is somebody knocking on the door.

    The effect of this structure is to present the postponed subject and the rest of the
    sentence as new information and thereby to give the sentence (in particular the
    subject) greater prominence. The postponed subject is normally an indefinite
    pronoun (cf. 5.25) or a noun phrase with an indefinite determiner (cf. 5.27).

    6.12 Cleft sentences

    In a cleft sentence the sentence is divided into two and one part is given greater
    prominence:

    It was Thomas Edison who (or that) invented the electric lamp.
    (Compare: Thomas Edison invented the electric lamp.)

    In a cleft sentence, the subject is "it", the verb is a form of be, and the emphasized
    part comes next. The rest of the sentence is usually introduced by that:

    It was an American flag that he was waving.

    It was in 1939 that (or when) the Second World War started.

    It was after I spent a summer working for a butcher that I decided to become
    a vegetarian.

    It was in Paris that Bob and Fiona fell in love.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Coordinate and Subordinate Clauses**\n\nUsing the information from Figure 6.1 and the description of there-structures, explain how coordination and subordination function in the sentence: ''The Great Lakes warn pregnant women and nursing mothers to avoid certain fish species and to limit their consumption of fatty fish.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the main clause and subordinate clauses in the sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how coordination (e.g., ''and'') and subordination (e.g., ''to avoid...'') work together to structure the sentence.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your analysis by referencing specific examples from the text (e.g., ''There is somebody knocking on the door'' vs. ''Nobody is outside'').\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly demonstrate an understanding of how coordination and subordination interact in complex sentences, as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Cleft Sentences**\n\nCompare the sentence ''It was Thomas Edison who (or that) invented the electric lamp.'' with the simple sentence ''Thomas Edison invented the electric lamp.''\n- **Part A**: Identify the grammatical features of a cleft sentence, including the subject, verb, and structure of the emphasized part.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the cleft sentence highlights specific information, using examples from the text (e.g., ''It was in 1939 that...'').\n- **Part C**: Discuss the purpose of cleft sentences in language, referencing the text''s explanation of their function in emphasizing information.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate an understanding of the grammatical structure and function of cleft sentences as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Construction of There-Structures**\n\nConstruct a there-structure that is grammatically correct and semantically parallel to the example provided in the text: ''There are several countries that have asked the Secretary-General for an emergency session of the Security Council.''\n- **Part A**: Create a there-structure with an indefinite pronoun as the postponed subject.\n- **Part B**: Create a there-structure with a noun phrase containing an indefinite determiner as the postponed subject.\n- **Part C**: Explain how these structures differ from the basic sentence pattern (e.g., ''Some countries have asked...'') by referencing the text''s explanation of the function of there-structures.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your constructions must be grammatically correct and demonstrate an understanding of the role of postponed subjects in there-structures as described in the text.'

- prompt: |-
    Pseudo-cleft sentences have a similar purpose, but the emphasized part comes at the end. The first part is normally a nominal relative clause (cf. 6.9) introduced by what. The verb be links the two parts of this SVC structure:

    What I want is a good sleep.
    What he did was open my letters.
    What I'm going to do is see the principal.

    6.13 Anticipatory that

    It is unusual to have a nominal clause as the subject of the sentence:
    [1] That the season has started so early seems a pity.

    Instead, the subject is usually moved to the end (the postponed subject) and its position is taken by if (the anticipatory subject):

    [la] It seems a pity that the season has started so early.
    Here are some other examples:

    It is likely that we'll be moving to Glasgow.

    It doesn't matter to me who pays my ticket.

    It's impossible to say when they are arriving.

    It has not been announced whether negotiations between the employers and the employees have broken down.
    132 An Introduction to English Grammar

    The exception is that nominal -ing clauses are natural in the normal subject position:

    Having a good self-image keeps me sane.
    Living in France was a wonderful experience.

    If the Rugby Football Union had wanted to engineer the triumph of the
    western region it could not have done better than keep Bath and Gloucester

    apart in the Cup semi-final draw.

    It was from a cross by David Beckham that Giggs had his first shot, although

    pulled wide.
    Blackpool, lying second from bottom, must now concentrate on avoiding

    relegation.
    3—0 down at half-time, West Ham never really looked like scoring.

    The season begins in earnest on Sunday with the Worth tournament, won by
    Sevenoaks last year.

    With two minutes left in the game, Michael Owen beat three defenders to

    place a perfect ball in the Arsenal net.
    There may be as many as 400 players in the game of street football, with the
    goals being separated by up to three or four miles of open countryside.

    SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT

    7.1 The general rules

    The verb agrees with its subject in number and person. The agreement applies
    whenever the verb displays distinctions in person and number. For all verbs other
    than de, the distinctions are found only in the present tense, where the third person
    singular has the -s form and the third person plural — like the first and second
    persons — has the base form:

    [1] The noise distracts them.
    [2] The noises distract them.

    The verb de makes further distinctions in the present and introduces distinc-
    tions in the past. These are as follows:

    present tense singular plural
    Ist person am

    2nd person are are
    3rd person is

    past tense singular plural
    Ist person was

    2nd person were were
    3rd person was

    The distinctions for third person agreement with de are illustrated in [3] and [4]
    for the present and in [5] and [6] for the past:

    [3] The noise is distracting them.
    [4] The noises are distracting them.
    [5] The noise was distracting them.
    [6] The noises were distracting them.

    142 An Introduction to English Grammar

    The agreement affects the first verb in the verb phrase, whether it is a main verb
    as in [1] [2] or an auxiliary as in [3] [6]. Modal auxiliaries (cf. 5.31), however, do
    not make distinctions in number or person:

    The noise distract them;
    may distract them.
    The noises
    If the subject is a noun phrase, the main noun determines the number of the
    phrase:

    demonstration
    demonstrators

    The noise of the { \ is distracting them.
    demonstration
    demonstrators

    The noises of the { \ are distracting them.

    It is a mistake to allow the verb to be influenced by an adjacent noun that is not the
    main noun.

    Noun phrases coordinated with and are generally plural, even though the indi-
    vidual noun phrases are singular:

    The President and the Vice-President are at the ceremony.
    Clauses are generally singular:

    Playing handball relaxes me.

    To make mistakes is only human.

    That he needs a shave is obvious.

    The rule of number agreement between subject (S) and verb applies to all finite
    clauses, whether they are main clauses or subordinate clauses:

    Inflation (S) is decreasing, and productivity (S) is rising.
    Nature (S) has arranged that no two flowers (S) are the same, even though
    they (S) appear very similar.

    7.2 And

    The subject is plural if it consists of two or more phrases that are linked by and,
    even if each is singular:

    Your kitchen, your living-room, and your dining-room are too small.

    The subject is also plural if "and" is implied though not actually present:
    Your kitchen, your living-room, your dining-room, are too small.

    It is plural when one of the main nouns is implied though not actually present:

    British and American English are dialects of one language. (British English
    and American English are... )

    Both the first and the second prize were won by students at our school.
    (Both the first prize and the second prize were... )

    On the other hand, if the linked units refer to the same thing, the subject is
    singular:

    The first serious poem I read in grade school and one I later studied in
    high school was ‘Ozymandias' by Shelley. (The first serious poem was
    identical with the one later studied.)

    A conscientious and honest politician has nothing to fear. (A politician
    who is both conscientious and honest has... )

    In some instances, two linked units may be viewed as either a combination (and
    therefore singular) or as separate units (and therefore plural):

    Bread and butter is good for you. (Bread with butter on it is... )
    Bread and butter have recently gone up in price. (Both bread and butter
    have...)

    If the noun phrases are introduced by each or every, the subject is singular:

    Every student and every instructor has to show an ID card to borrow
    books from the library.

    Each adult and each child was given a sandwich.

    Every bank and store was closed that day.

    See 7.4 for with and other linking expressions.

    7.3 Or, nor

    If the subject noun phrases are linked by or, either... or, or neither... nor, the
    verb may be singular or plural. When both phrases are singular, the verb is
    singular:

    144 An Introduction to English Grammar
    When both phrases are plural, the verb is plural:
    Either the Unionists or the Nationalists have to make concessions.

    When one phrase is singular and the other plural, usage guides prefer the verb to
    agree in number with the phrase closest to it:

    Three short essays or one long essay is required.
    Neither your brother nor your sisters are responsible.

    The plural is very often used in conversation regardless of which phrase precedes
    the verb.

    When the linked units are pronouns that require different verb forms, it is better
    to avoid having to make a choice. Instead, rephrase the sentence:

    Neither you nor I am responsible for the arrangements.
    Neither of us is responsible for the arrangements.

    7.4 With

    When a singular noun phrase is linked to a following noun phrase by a preposition
    such as with, the subject is singular even though the preposition is similar in
    meaning to and:

    His sister, together with her two youngest children, is staying with them.

    The subject is singular because the main noun is singular. Other prepositions used
    in a similar way include as well as and in addition to:

    The teacher, as well as the students, is enjoying the picnic.
    In the following sentence, the preposition is after:
    One person after another has objected to the proposed reform.

    7.5 Collective nouns

    A collective noun refers to a group of people or things. Some common examples
    are:
    administration enemy herd
    army firm jury
    audience family mob
    class fleet nation

    Usage Problems
    committee gang public
    crew government swarm
    crowd group team

    When members of the group are viewed as a unit, singular verbs and singular
    pronouns are usual:

    The audience is very noisy.

    The public is a right to know.

    The jury is retired for the night, but they will resume its deliberations
    tomorrow.

    The Olympic Committee has made its decision, and is awarded the 2008
    Games to Beijing.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Verbal Agreement in Compound Subjects\n\nConsider the sentence: ''Neither your brother nor your sisters are responsible.''\n- **Part A**: Identify the error in the sentence and explain why it violates the rules of subject-verb agreement as outlined in the text.\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the sentence correctly, ensuring that the verb agrees with the subject closest to it. Justify your choice using the guidelines provided in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how to agree a verb with a compound subject where one part is singular and the other plural, as explained in the text.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Preposition-Linked Subjects and Verbs\n\nAnalyze the sentence: ''His sister, together with her two youngest children, is staying with them.''\n- **Part A**: Explain why the subject ''His sister'' is singular despite the preposition ''with'' being used.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of a similar sentence using the preposition ''as well as'' and show how the subject-verb agreement applies.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must correctly apply the rule that when a singular noun phrase is linked by a preposition, the subject remains singular, as described in the text.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Collective Nouns and Verb Agreement\n\nExamine the sentence: ''The jury is retired for the night, but they will resume its deliberations tomorrow.''\n- **Part A**: Explain why the collective noun ''jury'' is treated as singular in the first clause, even though it refers to multiple people.\n- **Part B**: Contrast this with the sentence: ''The Olympic Committee has made its decision, and is awarded the 2008 Games to Beijing.'' Explain how the singular verb ''has'' and ''is awarded'' are appropriate for a collective noun.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of when collective nouns are treated as singular or plural, based on the text''s examples and explanations.'

- prompt: "7.6 Indefinite pronouns  \nMost indefinite pronouns (cf. 5.25) take singular verbs:  \n\nEverybody is now here.  \nSomeone /as borrowed my comb.  \n\nIn formal writing, use singular verbs even when a plural phrase follows the  \npronouns:  \n\nEither of them zs prepared to help you.  \nEach of our friends fas taken the course.  \n\nSeveral indefinite pronouns (none, all, some, any) and the fractions may be either  \nsingular or plural. If they refer to one thing, they take a singular verb:  \n\nSome (of the material) 7s not suitable for children.  \nHalf (the county) zs under water.  \n\nAll (the fruit) 4as been eaten.  \nNone (of the crop) was in danger.  \n\nIf they refer to more than one person or thing, they take a plural verb:  \n\n145  \n146 An Introduction to English Grammar  \n\nSome (of the pages) are missing.  \nHalf (of the members) Have voted in favour of the amendment to the  \nconstitution.  \n\nAll (my friends) were abroad.  \nNone (of us) Aave heard about the new regulation.  \n\nNone is also used with a singular verb:  \nNone (of us) as heard about the new regulation.  \n\nProblems sometimes arise in the choice of pronouns or determiners for which  \nsingular indefinite pronouns are the antecedent. The traditional choice for formal  \nwriting is a masculine pronoun or determiner, according to what is required in the  \ncontext:  \n[1] Everybody wanted a room of fis own.  \n[2] Does anyone think /e can solve this problem?  \n\nIt is also the traditional choice when noun phrases are introduced by indefinite deter-  \nminers such as every or any (cf. 5.26) or when the phrases refer to a class of people:  \n\n[3] Every student has handed in /zs work on time.  \n[4] A good musician receives more invitations to perform than /e can manage.  \n\nChanges in attitude have led many to avoid using the masculine to refer to both  \nmale and female. It is generally possible to rephrase the sentence to avoid suggest-  \ning a sexist bias. One way is to avoid using a pronoun or possessive determiner, as  \nin [la]; another way is to make the subject plural, as in [2a]-|4a]:  \n\n[la] Everybody wanted a separate room.  \n[2a] Do any of you think you can solve this problem?\n\nThe text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Pronoun Agreement in Complex Sentences**\n\nConsider the following sentences: [1] Everybody wanted a room of his own. [2] Does anyone think he can solve this problem? [3] Every student has handed in his work on time. [4] A good musician receives more invitations to perform than he can manage.\n\n**Task**: Analyze each sentence for grammatical accuracy regarding pronoun agreement, using the principles from the text.\n- **Part A**: Identify which sentences use a masculine pronoun (he, his) and which use a singular verb with an indefinite pronoun.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the traditional choice of masculine pronouns is used in these sentences, referencing the text''s explanation about context and noun phrases.\n- **Part C**: Propose a rephrased version of sentence [1] that avoids suggesting a sexist bias, as discussed in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of pronoun agreement rules and the shift in traditional usage toward gender-neutral language.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Indefinite Pronoun Verb Agreement**\n\nExamine the following sentences: [a] Some (of the material) is not suitable for children. [b] Half (of the county) is under water.

[d] None (of the crop) was in danger.\n\n**Task**: Determine whether each sentence uses a singular or plural verb, and explain your reasoning based on the text''s guidelines.\n- **Part A**: Identify which sentences use singular verbs and which use plural verbs.\n- **Part B**: Explain the difference in verb agreement between sentences [a] and [b], citing the text''s explanation about referring to one thing vs. more than one person or thing.\n- **Part C**: Correct the verb agreement in sentence [c], which contains an error, and justify your correction using the text''s rules.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must accurately apply the rules for indefinite pronouns and demonstrate an understanding of when to use singular or plural verbs.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Rephrasing for Gender-Neutral Language**\n\nThe text discusses changes in attitude that have led many to avoid using masculine pronouns when referring to both male and female. It also suggests rephrasing sentences to avoid sexist bias, such as avoiding pronouns or using plural subjects.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Rewrite sentence [4] from the text, "A good musician receives more invitations to perform than he can manage," in a gender-neutral way.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the original sentence uses ''he'' and how the revised version avoids gender bias, referencing the text''s discussion on traditional vs. modern usage.\n- **Part C**: Create a new sentence that uses a plural subject to avoid gender bias, similar to the examples in the text. Your sentence must include an indefinite determiner (e.g., every, any) and a pronoun.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must show an understanding of gender-neutral language and the strategies presented in the text for rephrasing sentences.'

- prompt: |-
    [3a] All students have handed in their work on time.

    [4a] Good musicians receive more invitations to perform than they can manage.

    In recent usage, the plural pronouns their and they are increasingly being used,
    especially in informal contexts:

    Everybody wanted a room of their own.
    Does anyone think they can solve this problem?
    7.7 Quantity phrases

    Plural phrases of quantity or extent take singular verbs when the quantity or extent
    is viewed as a unit:
    Usage Problems
    Ten pounds is enough.
    Two years seems too long to wait.
    Five miles was as far as they would walk.

    Otherwise, a plural is used:

    Twenty years have passed since I last saw Helen.
    Twenty-seven pounds have been stolen from his wallet.

    7.8 Singular nouns ending in -s

    Nouns ending in -s are singular when they refer to a field of study, for example
    economics, linguistics, mathematics, physics, statistics:

    Statistics is one of the options in the degree course.
    Economics was my favourite subject at school.

    Some of these nouns are often used in a different sense and may then be plural:

    Your statistics are inaccurate.
    The acoustics in this hall have been improved.

    Names of diseases that end in -s are generally treated as singular, for example
    AIDS, measles, mumps:

    AIDS is particularly prevalent in Africa.

    Names of games that end in -s are singular, for example billiards, darts, draughts,
    dominoes:

    Dominoes is the only game I play at home.
    Individual pieces have singular and plural forms:

    You've dropped a domino on the floor.
    The dominoes are on the floor.

    7.9 Who, which, that

    The relative pronouns who, which, and that have the same number as the nouns
    they refer to.
    The singular is correct in the following sentences:

    I have written a letter for the student who is applying for a job in our
    department. (The student is applying... )

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Pronoun Usage and Quantity Phrases**\n\nGiven the following sentences: ''Everybody wanted a room of their own. Does anyone think they can solve this problem?'' and ''Ten pounds is enough. Twenty years have passed since I last saw Helen.''\n- **Task A**: Explain the grammatical reasoning behind using ''their'' and ''they'' as plural pronouns in the first sentence, referencing the text''s explanation of informal usage.\n- **Task B**: Analyze the difference in verb agreement between ''is'' and ''have'' in the quantity phrases, linking it to the text''s discussion on singular vs. plural verbs for quantity expressions.\n- **Task C**: Construct a new sentence that correctly uses both plural pronouns and quantity phrases, ensuring it adheres to the grammatical rules outlined in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference at least two distinct rules from the text and demonstrate an understanding of their application in varied contexts.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Differentiation of Noun Classification**\n\nThe text differentiates between singular and plural nouns ending in -s, including fields of study and games. Consider the following:\n- **Part A**: Explain why ''statistics'' is singular in ''Statistics is one of the options...'' but plural in ''Your statistics are inaccurate.'' Reference the text''s examples for this distinction.\n- **Part B**: Provide a sentence using ''dominoes'' in its singular form, explaining how it differs from the plural form as described in the text.\n- **Part C**: Create a sentence that correctly uses both ''mathematics'' (singular) and ''statistics'' (plural), demonstrating the difference in their classification as per the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the specific noun classifications discussed in the text and show an understanding of their varying uses.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Relative Pronoun Usage in Context**\n\nThe text explains that ''who'', ''which'', and ''that'' must agree in number with the nouns they refer to. Construct a sentence that correctly uses each of these pronouns in both singular and plural contexts, referencing the text''s examples.\n- **Task A**: Write a sentence using ''who'' in both singular and plural forms, ensuring correct agreement with the noun.\n- **Task B**: Create a sentence with ''which'' that correctly matches the number of the noun it refers to.\n- **Task C**: Form a sentence with ''that'' that demonstrates proper agreement in number.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s examples and show a clear understanding of how each pronoun functions grammatically.'

    The weapons which were found during the search were produced as
    evidence in court. (The weapons were found... )

    She reported on the decisions that were made at the meeting. (The decisions
    were made... )

    The same rule of agreement applies when the relative pronoun refers to a
    personal pronoun:

    You who are my closest friends know best what needs to be done. (You
    are my closest friends.)

    It is I who am to blame. (I am to blame.)

    It is he who zs responsible for organizing the event. (He is responsible . . . )

    In less formal contexts, constructions beginning /?'s.. . will take objective forms
    of the pronouns (cf. 7.13) and third person verb forms:

    It's me who's/who was to blame.
    It's us who are/were to blame.

    7.10 What

    Either a singular verb or a plural verb may be used with the pronoun what. The
    choice depends on the meaning:

    What worries them is that he has not yet made up his mind. (The thing
    that worries them is... )
    They live in what ave called ranch houses. (in houses that are called... )

    Similarly, use either the singular or the plural with mhat-clauses, according to the
    meaning:

    What they need is a good rest. (The thing that they need is... )
    What were once painful ordeals ave now routine examinations. (Those
    things...are now...)

    Usage Problems

    7.11 There is, there are

    In speech it is common to use a singular verb after introductory there (cf. 6.11)
    even when the subject (which follows the verb) is plural:

    There's two men waiting for you.
    In formal writing, follow the general rule:

    There zs somebody waiting for you.
    There are two men waiting for you.

    7.12 Citations and titles

    Citations and titles always take a singular verb, even though they consist of plural
    phrases:

    ‘Children' zs an irregular plural.
    Reservoir Dogs 1s a very violent film.
    Oscar and Lucinda was awarded the Booker Prize in 1988.

Justify your choice using examples from the text (e.g., ''It is he who zs responsible...'').\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the sentence with a different pronoun and explain how the verb agreement changes based on the subject complement.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the use of ''who'' in relative clauses with the use of ''that'' in restrictive clauses, using examples from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of pronoun reference, verb agreement, and the distinction between relative pronouns ''who'' and ''that''.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Verb Agreement with Indefinite Pronouns**\n\nThe text discusses the use of either a singular or plural verb with the pronoun ''what'' based on its meaning.

- prompt: |-
    When the subject complement is a pronoun, it is usually in the objective case: [t's
    me, That's him. Such sentences tend to occur in speech or written dialogue. Sub-
    jective forms as in Jt is J and This 1s he are felt to be stilted, though they may be
    used in formal contexts in constructions such as Jt is I who am to blame, It 1s he who

    is responsible (cf. 7.9).

    7.14 Coordinated phrases

    In 5.18 I stated the rules for the selection of subjective and objective cases in
    pronouns: we use the subjective case for the subject and (in formal style) for the
    subject complement; otherwise we use the objective case. Errors of case may arise
    when a pronoun is coordinated with a noun or another pronoun:

    [1] You and her will take charge. (Correct to You and she.)

    [2] I think Bob and me have the right approach. (Correct to Bob and I.)
    [3] Everybody knows Nancy and I. (Correct to Nancy and me.)

    [4] The tickets are for you and I. (Correct to you and me.)

    149

    150

    An Introduction to English Grammar

    The errors do not occur when there is only one pronoun. You can therefore test
    which form is correct by using just the second pronoun:

    [la] She will take charge. (She is subject.)

    [2a] I think J have the right approach. (J is subject of the subordinate clause.)
    [3a] Everybody knows me. (Me is direct object.)

    [4a] The tickets are for me. (Me is complement of the preposition for.)

    There is a similar possibility of error when we or us is accompanied by a noun:
    They complained about the way us students were behaving.

    Correct to: we students. (cf. the way we were behaving.)

    They will not succeed in pushing we Australians around.
    Correct to: us Australians. (cf. pushing us around.)

    7.15 After as and than

    In formal writing, as and than are always conjunctions in comparisons. The case of
    the pronoun depends on its function in the comparative clause, though the verb
    may be absent:

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Subject-Verb Agreement and Pronoun Case in Coordinate Structures**\n\nCorrect the pronouns in the following sentences, ensuring proper subject and object cases based on their function:\n1.

The prize is awarded to [she/her] and [he/him].\n\n**Answer Requirement**: For each sentence, justify your choice by identifying the pronoun''s role (subject or object) and citing examples from the text.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Case Errors in Coordinate Phrases with Nouns**\n\nCorrect the pronoun case in these sentences, using the rules from the text:\n1. The professor congratulated [we/us] students on their success.\n2. They are planning to visit [us/we] and [you/you].\n3. The committee includes [I/me] and [they/them].\n4. The event is for [she/her] and [us/we].\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Explain the function of each pronoun in its sentence and reference specific examples from the text to support your corrections.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Pronoun Case in Comparative Structures**\n\nCorrect the pronouns in these sentences, applying the rules for as/than comparisons:\n1. The teacher is better than [we/us] students.\n2. The plan is more effective than [they/them] and [us/we].\n3. They are faster than [I/me] and [she/her].\n4. The argument is stronger than [he/him] and [we/us].\n\n**Answer Requirement**: For each sentence, explain the function of the pronoun in the comparative clause and reference examples from the text to justify your corrections.'

- prompt: |-
    [1] They felt the same way as he. (He is subject.)
    [2] They paid him more than me. (Me is indirect object.)
    [3] He likes me more than her. (Her is direct object.)

    You can test which form is correct by expanding the comparative clause:

    [la] They felt the same way as he did.
    [2a] They paid him more than they paid me.
    [3a] He likes me more than he likes her.

    In less formal contexts, the objective forms are normal even when the pronoun is
    subject:

    [1b] They felt the same way as /um.

    7.16 After but

    But meaning ‘except' is a preposition. In formal writing, the pronoun following the
    preposition but should be in the objective case:

    I know everybody here but her.
    Nobody but me can tell the difference.

    Usage Problems

    7.17 After let

    Use the objective case after /et:

    Let us examine the problem carefully.
    Let them make their own decisions.

    A coordinated pronoun should be objective:

    Let you and me take the matter in hand.
    Let Bob and her say what they think.

    7.18 Who, whom

    Whom is not often used in everyday speech. In formal writing, however, the
    distinction between subjective who and objective whom is retained:

    She is somebody who knows her own mind. (cf. She knows her own
    mind.)
    She is somebody on whom I can rely. (cf. I can rely on her.)

    Parenthetic clauses like I believe and I think should not affect the choice of case:

    [1] I recently spoke to somebody who I believe knows you well.
    (cf. She knows you well, I believe.)

    [2] I recently spoke to somebody whom I believe you know well.
    (cf. You know her well, I believe.)

    The following example is different:

    [3] She is somebody whom I consider to be a good candidate for promotion.
    (cf. I consider her to be a good candidate for promotion.)

    I consider in [3] is not parenthetic. It cannot be omitted like I believe in [1] and [2].
    Whom in [3] is the direct object of consider.

    Similarly, the distinction between subjective whoever and whomever is retained
    in formal writing:

    Whoever wants to see me should make an appointment with my secretary.
    (cf. She wants to see me.)

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.

    152. An Introduction to English Grammar
    7.19 Case with -ing clauses
    An -ing participle clause may have a nominal function (i.e. a function similar to
    one possible for a noun phrase). If the subject of the clause is a pronoun, a name,

    or other short personal noun phrase, it is preferable to put it into the genitive
    case:

    They were surprised at Paul's/ his refusing to join the club.

    He was afraid of my protesting against the new rule.

    I dislike Robert's seeing X-rated movies.

    Do you know the reason for your sister's breaking off the engagement?

    Use the common case (that is, not the genitive case) for long noun phrases:

    I remember a car with a broken rear window being parked alongside our
    house.

    They were annoyed at the students and staff demonstrating against cuts in
    student loans.

    The common case is also used for non-personal nouns:

    I am interested in the car being sold as soon as possible.

    Except in formal writing, the subject is often in the common case (for nouns) or
    objective case (for pronouns):

    They were surprised at Paul/him refusing to join the club.

    In both formal and informal writing, the genitive case is used when the clause is the
    subject:

    My forgetting her name amused everybody.

    Similarly, use the common case (for nouns) or objective case (for pronouns)
    after verbs of perception, such as see, or certain other verbs, the most frequent of
    which are find, keep, and leave:

    I kept Paul waiting.
    We watched them leaving.

    Usage Problems 153

    AUXILIARIES AND VERBS

    Problems with auxiliaries

    When it follows a modal (cf. 5.31), the auxiliary Have is often pronounced like of

    and is therefore sometimes misspelled of. The correct spelling is have after the
    modals in these sentences:

    I should have said something about it long ago.
    Somebody else would have paid.

    You might have helped me.

    She could have become the mayor.

(a) They were surprised at Paul''s/ his refusing to join the club.\n(b) I remember a car with a broken rear window being parked alongside our house.\n2. (a) He was afraid of my protesting against the new rule.\n(b) They were annoyed at the students and staff demonstrating against cuts in student loans.\n3. (a) I dislike Robert''s seeing X-rated movies.\n(b) The common case is also used for non-personal nouns: I am interested in the car being sold as soon as possible.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: For each pair, explain why the case choice is correct based on the subject of the clause (pronoun/name vs. long noun phrase) and explicitly reference the text''s rule about genitive case for short pronouns/names.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Auxiliary Verb Pronunciation and Spelling\n\nCorrect the following sentences by adjusting the spelling of ''have'' after modals, ensuring it is spelled as ''have'' rather than ''of'':\n1. I should ______ said something about it long ago.\n2. Somebody else would ______ paid.\n3. You might ______ helped me.\n4. She could ______ become the mayor.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: For each sentence, provide the correct spelling of ''have'' and justify why it is spelled as ''have'' rather than ''of'', citing the text''s explanation about pronunciation.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Logical Reasoning with Case Usage\n\nConstruct two sentences using -ing clauses where the case (genitive or common) is determined by the subject of the clause. Explain your reasoning for each case choice based on:\n1. A short personal noun phrase (e.g., Paul''s/ his)\n2. A long noun phrase (e.g., the students and staff)\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentences must demonstrate understanding of the text''s rule about using genitive case for short pronouns/names and common case for long noun phrases. Your explanation must explicitly reference the text''s example with ''Paul''s/ his refusing to join the club'' and ''the students and staff demonstrating against cuts in student loans''.\n'

    The semi-modal had better is often rendered as "had better" or "better" in speech: He
    had better not be late. Use the full expression in formal writing: He had better not be late.

    Ought to should be the first verb in the verb phrase. Combinations such as didn't
    ought to and hadn't ought to are non-standard.

    Lie, lay

    The intransitive verb "lie" (‘be in a reclining position') and the transitive verb "lay"
    (‘place') are often confused, because the past tense of "lie" is "lay" and the present
    tense of "lay" is "lay" or "lays". Here are the forms of the two verbs:

    present tense lie, lies lay, lays
    -ing participle lying laying
    past tense lay laid

    -ed participle lain laid

    Here are examples of sentences with these verbs:

    lie Is she lying on the sofa?
    The children lay asleep on the floor.
    I have lain in bed all morning.

    lay Are you laying a bet on the next race?
    He laid his head on his arms.

    The hens have laid a dozen eggs this morning.

    Present tense

    Standard written English requires the -s inflection for the third person singular
    and no inflection elsewhere (cf. 7.1 for the verb "do"):

    154

    An Introduction to English Grammar

    John says. I say.

    She knows. We know.
    The dog bites. They bite.
    It does. You do.

    Forms such as I says, you knows, and it do are frequently used in casual conversa-
    tion, but they are non-standard forms and should therefore be avoided in writing.

    Negative contractions sometimes cause difficulties. The standard contraction of
    does not is doesn't (she doesn't), not don't. Negative ain't is commonly heard in
    conversation as a contraction of various combinations, including am not, is not,
    have not, and has not, but it is not a standard form.

    7.23. Past and -ed participle
    Regular verbs have the same form for the past and the -ed participle:

    He laughed loudly.
    He hasn't laughed so much for a long time.

    Some irregular verbs have different forms:

    She spoke to me about it.
    She has spoken to me about it.

    Except in written representations of non-standard speech, do not write non-
    standard forms for the past and -ed participle:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Verb Forms and Tense Usage**\n\nUsing the information provided, construct a sentence that correctly applies all four of the following rules:\n1. Use the past tense form of ''lie'' (lay) in a sentence that describes an action completed in the past.\n2. Use the -ed participle form of ''lie'' (lain) in a sentence that describes a completed action.\n3. Use the present tense of ''lay'' (lay) in a sentence that describes an ongoing action.\n4. Use the present participle form of ''lay'' (laying) in a sentence that describes an action happening now.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Write the four sentences, ensuring correct verb forms and tense usage.\n- **Part B**: Examine the differences between ''lay'' (transitive) and ''lie'' (intransitive) in your sentences, explaining how the verbs are used differently.\n- **Part C**: Contrast the standard written form (e.g., ''He has lain in bed'') with a non-standard casual form (e.g., ''He laid in bed'').\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate accurate application of all verb forms and their respective uses, with clear explanations of the differences between ''lie'' and ''lay'' in various contexts.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Verb Contraction and Standard Forms**\n\nGiven the rules about verb contractions and standard forms, identify and correct the following non-standard sentences:\n1. ''She says.''\n2. ''You knows.''\n3. ''It do.''\n4. ''They does not.''\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Correct each non-standard sentence to its standard form, using the rules provided.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the original sentences are non-standard, referencing the rule that standard written English requires the -s inflection for third person singular.\n- **Part C**: Compare the standard form with a casual alternative, such as ''you knows'' and ''it do'', explaining why these are not acceptable in formal writing.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of standard and non-standard verb forms, with explanations that directly reference the rules provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving with Tense and Participle Forms**\n\nConstruct a short narrative (two to three sentences) that incorporates all of the following grammatical elements:\n1. Past tense form of ''lie'' (lay)\n2. -ed participle form of ''lie'' (lain)\n3. Present tense of ''lay'' (lay)\n4. Present participle form of ''lay'' (laying)\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Write the narrative, ensuring correct use of all four verb forms.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how the narrative demonstrates the use of ''lie'' and ''lay'' in different contexts, highlighting the distinction between transitive and intransitive uses.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the use of tense and participle forms contributes to the narrative''s clarity and coherence.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate all specified grammatical elements into a coherent narrative, with clear explanations of the verb forms and their functions in the context of the story.'

- prompt: "I done my assignment. (Correct to did.)  \nWe seen the movie last week. (Correct to saw.)  \nHe was shook up by the news. (Correct to shaken.)\n\nSome verbs have variant forms that are acceptable for both past and -ed participle:  \ndreamed, dreamt; kneeled, knelt; lighted, lit; shined, shone. The past and -ed participle  \nof hang is generally hanged in the sense ‘suspend by the neck until dead' (He was  \nhanged for murder) and is hung for all other meanings (The picture was hung on the  \nwall).\n\n7.24 Past and past subjunctive  \nThe past subjunctive is used to refer to situations that are very unlikely or that are  \n\ncontrary to the facts (cf. 4.19):  \n\nI wish she were here.  \nHe behaves as though he were your friend.  \nSuppose she were here now.  \nIf I were you, I wouldn't tell him.  \n\nThe only past subjunctive is \"were\", which is used for the first and third person  \nsingular of the verb \"be\" in formal English. In less formal style the simple past \"was\" is  \ngenerally used in the same contexts:  \n\nI wish she was here.  \nIf I was you, I wouldn't tell him.  \n\nFor the plural and the second person singular of be and for verbs other than be,  \nthe simple past is used to refer to situations in the present or future that are very  \nunlikely or that are contrary to fact. One very common context is in conditional  \nclauses, that is, clauses that express a condition on which something else is  \ndependent:  \n\nIf they were graduating next year, they would need to borrow less money.  \n(But they probably will not be graduating next year.)  \n\nIf she lived at home, she would be happier. (But she does not live at  \nhome.)  \n\nIf you were an inch taller, you could be a basketball player. (But you're not  \nlikely to get taller.)  \n\nThe verb in the main clause is always a past modal, usually would or could.  \nIf the situations are set in the past, the past perfect is used in the conditional  \nclause and a past perfect modal, usually would have, in the main clause:  \n\nIf we had been there yesterday, we would have seen them. (But we were not  \nthere yesterday.)\n\nThe text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Past Tense and Subjunctive Usage**\n\nCompare the sentences: ''He was hanged for murder'' and ''The picture was hung on the wall''.\n- **Step 1**: Explain why ''hanged'' is used in the first sentence and ''hung'' in the second.\n- **Step 2**: Provide two examples of other verbs that have different past and -ed forms (e.g., dreamt/dreamed, knelt/kneeled) and explain their usage in context.\n- **Step 3**: Justify the use of ''were'' versus ''was'' in the sentence: ''I wish she were here'' compared to ''I wish she was here''.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the specific rules for past participles and subjunctive moods as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Conditional Clauses and Subjunctive Moods**\n\nConsider the sentence: ''If they were graduating next year, they would need to borrow less money.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the tense of the conditional clause and the main clause.\n- **Step 2**: Explain why ''were'' is used in the conditional clause instead of ''were''.\n- **Step 3**: Create a new conditional sentence that uses the past perfect and past perfect modal (e.g., ''If we had been there, we would have seen them'').\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must show an understanding of conditional structures and the use of subjunctive moods in hypothetical situations as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Past Subjunctive and Logical Reasoning**\n\nAnalyze the sentence: ''I wish she were here.''\n- **Part A**: Explain why this sentence uses the past subjunctive ''were'' instead of the simple past ''was''.\n- **Part B**: Provide a logical example where the past subjunctive is used to express a situation contrary to fact.\n- **Part C**: Compare the usage of ''were'' and ''was'' in the following sentences: ''I wish she was here.'' (less formal) vs. ''I wish she were here.'' (formal).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the grammatical rules and logical contexts for using the past subjunctive as presented in the text.'

- prompt: "Here is the extracted and correctly formatted content:\n\n---\n\nIf he had been given a good mark, he would have told me. (But it seems that  \nhe was not given a good mark.)\n\nIf the auxiliary in the conditional clause is *were*, *had*, or *should*, we can omit *if* and front the auxiliary:\n\nWere she here now, there would be no problem.  \nHad we stayed at home, we would have met them.  \nShould you see him, give him my best wishes.\n\n7.25 Multiple negation\n\nStandard English generally allows only one negative in the same clause. Non-  \nstandard English allows two or more negatives in the same clause:\n\ndouble negation: They didn't say nothing.  \ncorrected: They said nothing.  \nThey didn't say anything.\n\ntriple negation: Nobody never believes nothing I say.  \ncorrected: Nobody ever believes anything I say.\n\ndouble negation: I didn't like it, neither.  \ncorrected: I didn't like it, either.\n\nNegative adverbs include not only the obvious negative *never*, but also *barely*,  \n*hardly*, *scarcely*:\n\ndouble negation: I can't hardly tell the difference.  \ncorrected: I can hardly tell the difference.\n\nStandard English allows double negation when the two negatives combine to  \nmake a positive. When *not* modifies an adjective or adverb with a negative prefix  \n(unhappy, indecisively), it reduces the negative force of the word, perhaps to ex-  \npress an understatement:\n\nIt was a not unhappy occasion. (‘a fairly happy occasion')  \nShe spoke not indecisively. (‘fairly decisively')\n\nOccasionally both the auxiliary and the main verb are negated:\n\nWe can't not agree to their demands. (‘It's not possible for us not to agree  \nto their demands.')\n\nOther negative combinations also occasionally occur:\n\nNobody has no complaints. (\"There is nobody that has no complaints';  \n‘Everybody has some complaints.')\n\nADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS\n\n7.26 Confusion between adjectives and adverbs\n\nIt is occasionally not obvious whether to use an adjective or a related adverb. One  \nrule is to use an adjective if the word is the subject complement after a linking verb  \n(cf. 3.8). The adjective characterizes the subject:\n\nUsage Problems\n\nShe looked angry.\n\nShe feels bad.\n\nI don't feel well.\n\nHe sounded nervous.  \nThe flowers smell sweet.  \nThe food tastes good.\n\nThe text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Conditional Clause Structure and Negation**\n\nAnalyze the sentence: ''If he had been given a good mark, he would have told me. (But it seems that he was not given a good mark.)''\n- **Part A**: Identify the type of conditional structure used in the first sentence. Explain why this specific form is appropriate for expressing hypothetical scenarios.\n- **Part B**: Examine the negation in the second sentence. Determine whether this is a double or single negation and provide evidence from the text to support your classification.\n- **Part C**: Compare the use of *were*, *had*, and *should* in conditional sentences. How does omitting *if* and fronting the auxiliary alter the meaning or tone of these sentences?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate grammatical terminology from the text and demonstrate an understanding of conditional structures and negation in English.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Adjective vs. Adverb Confusion**\n\nConsider the sentences: ''She looked angry.'' and ''She feels bad.''\n- **Part A**: Use the rule from the text to determine whether ''angry'' and ''bad'' are adjectives or adverbs. Justify your answer with examples from the text.\n- **Part B**: Construct two sentences that correctly use adjectives and adverbs based on the text''s guidelines. One sentence must feature an adjective following a linking verb, and the other must use an adverb modifying a verb.\n- **Part C**: Explain why the text references ''Usage Problems'' in this context. How does identifying these problems help prevent common errors in language use?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of adjective/adverb distinction and the role of linking verbs in sentence structure.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Negation**\n\nEvaluate the sentence: ''Nobody never believes nothing I say.''\n- **Part A**: Identify how many negations are present in the sentence. Correct it according to standard English rules and explain your reasoning.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the sentence ''We can''t not agree to their demands.'' Explain how this uses negation in a way that is different from standard double negation. How does the text suggest this sentence might be interpreted in informal or conversational contexts?\n- **Part C**: Create a sentence that uses triple negation, correct it according to standard English rules, and explain how the correction changes the meaning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a deep understanding of negation patterns, their corrections, and the implications of different negation structures in English usage.'

- prompt: |-
    The adverb badly is often used with the linking verb feel, but in formal writing use
    feel bad. Well in I don't feel well is an adjective meaning ‘in good health'. It is an
    adverb in ‘He didn't play well.'

    If the word characterizes the manner of the action denoted by the verb, use an
    adverb in formal writing:

    She writes well. (Not: ‘She writes good')

    He hurt his neck badly. (Not: ‘He hurt his neck bad')

    Your dog is barking loudly. (Not: ‘Your dog is barking loud')

    If the job is done satisfactorily, I will give him other jobs (Not: ‘If the job
    is done satisfactory .. .')

    Some words can have the same form for both the adjective and the adverb: early,
    fast, hard, late, slow, quick, long, and words in -ly that are formed from nouns
    denoting time (hourly, daily). The adverbs slow, quick, and deep also have parallel
    adverb forms in -y: slowly, quickly, and deeply. These three adverbs formed with-
    out the -y suffix are mainly used with imperatives:

    Drive slow.
    Come quick.
    Dig deep into your pocket for a donation.

    Both direct and directly are adverbs in the senses ‘in a straight line' or ‘without
    anything intervening':

    We fax our orders direct to London for immediate despatch.
    The Transcaucasian republics try to bypass Moscow by selling oil directly
    to Ukrainian nationalists.

    7.27. Comparison

    Most adjectives and adverbs are gradable (cf. 5.14): we can view them as being on
    a scale of less or more. Gradable words allow comparison (less foolish, more quickly)
    and modification by intensifiers that show how far they are along the scale (somewhat
    foolish, very quickly). Some adjectives and adverbs are not gradable; for example,
    we cannot say more medical or very previously.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Correct Usage of Adverbs in Formal Writing**\n\nIdentify and correct the incorrect adverb usage in the following sentences, ensuring that they adhere to formal writing conventions as outlined in the text:\n1. "She writes good."\n2. "He hurt his neck bad."\n3. "Your dog is barking loud."\n4. "If the job is done satisfactory..."\n\n**Task**: For each sentence, explain why the original form is incorrect and provide the correct adverb form. Justify your answers using examples from the text (e.g., ''She writes well'' is correct because ''well'' characterizes the manner of writing).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your corrections must strictly follow formal adverb usage rules, and you must reference specific examples from the text to support your reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Adverb-Adjective Confusion**\n\nCreate three sentences that correctly use adverbs and adjectives based on the text''s guidelines. Each sentence must:\n- Use a word that can function as both an adjective and an adverb (e.g., fast, early, slow)\n- Correctly apply the -ly suffix where necessary (e.g., ''hourly'', ''daily'')\n- Avoid common adverb-adjective confusion (e.g., ''quickly'' vs. ''quick'')\n\n**Task**: For each sentence, specify whether the word is used as an adjective or adverb and explain your choice based on the text''s criteria (e.g., ''She writes well'' uses ''well'' as an adverb because it describes the manner of writing).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentences must demonstrate a clear understanding of when to use adjectives and adverbs, with correct spelling and grammar.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Analysis of Gradable vs. Non-gradable Adjectives/Adverbs**\n\nClassify the following terms as gradable or non-gradable, based on the text''s explanation of these concepts:\n1. ''Medical''\n2. ''Previously''\n3. ''Satisfactory''\n4. ''Quickly''\n5. ''Directly''\n\n**Task**: For each term, provide a brief explanation of why it is classified as gradable or non-gradable. Use examples from the text (e.g., ''more medical'' is non-gradable, while ''more quickly'' is gradable) to support your answers.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your classification must be accurate and clearly justified using the text''s definitions of gradability, with specific examples cited where applicable.'

    Writers vary on whether certain adjectives or adverbs are gradable. Those who
    treat them as non-gradable think that they express the highest degree (excellent) or
    that they cannot be measured on a scale (uniquely). The most common of these
    disputed words are complete(ly), perfect(ly), unique(ly). Yet even in formal writing
    we find expressions such as a more perfect union or the most extreme poverty. If you
    are in doubt, it is better not to treat these words as gradable in formal writing.

    Use the comparative for two only (the older of the two girls) and the superlative
    for more than two (the oldest of the three girls). The comparative of the adjective bad
    and the adverb badly is worse (not worser); the superlative is worst (not worsest).

    Fewer goes with count nouns and less with non-count nouns (cf. 5.4):

    demonstrators danger
    fewer « mistakes less « money
    votes time

    7.28 Only

    Where you put only in a sentence may affect how the reader understands the
    sentence. In speech you can make your intention clear through your intonation,
    but when you write, it is best to put only next to the word or phrase it refers to:

    Only children can swim in the lake before noon. (not adults)
    Children can only swim in the lake before noon. (not fish)

    Children can swim only in the lake before noon. (not in the pool)
    Children can swim in the lake only before noon. (not in the afternoon)

    The following words should also be positioned with care: also, even, just, merely.

    7.29 Dangling modifiers

    Absolute clauses are non-finite or verbless adverbial clauses that have their own
    subjects:

    All their money having been spent on repairs, they applied to the bank for a
    loan.

    He nervously began his speech, his voice trembling.

    They strolled by the river, their heads bare.

    If adverbial clauses have no subject of their own, their implied subject is generally
    the same as the subject of the sentence:

    Having spent all his money on a vacation to Hawaii, Norman applied to
    the bank for a loan. (Norman has spent all his money on a vacation
    to Hawaii.)

    A dangling modifier has no subject of its own, and its implied subject cannot
    be identified with the subject of the sentence though it can usually be identified
    with some other phrase in the sentence:

    Style

    8.1 Style in writing

    In normal unprepared conversation we have only a very limited time to monitor
    what we say and the way we say it. We have much more time when we write, and
    generally we have the opportunity to revise what we write. Sometimes we are
    happy with our first decision, but very often we think of new things as we write
    and perhaps want to change both what we write and how we write it.

    In our revisions we can draw on the resources that are available to us in various
    aspects of the language. Our writing style reflects the choices we make. In this
    chapter we will be looking at the choices we make in grammar. In particular, we
    will be considering how we can ensure that we convey our message effectively.

    EMPHASIS

    8.2 End-focus

    It is normal to arrange the information in our message so that the most important
    information comes at the end. We follow this principle of end-focus when we put
    such information at the end of a sentence or clause. In contrast, the beginning of a
    sentence or clause typically contains information that is general knowledge, or is
    obvious from the context, or may be assumed as given because it has been men-
    tioned earlier.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Style and End-Focus Principle**\n\nIn your essay, analyze how the principle of end-focus (as described in the text) influences the structure of sentences and clauses in your writing. Discuss how this principle aligns with the broader idea of effective communication in written style (as mentioned in the text).\n- **Step 1**: Provide a specific example of a sentence that uses end-focus.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how this example demonstrates the text''s point about prioritizing important information at the end.\n- **Step 3**: Relate this to the text''s discussion on how style choices affect message clarity and effectiveness.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both the end-focus principle and its role in written style, with a clear example that reflects the text''s main ideas.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Grammar Choices in Style**\n\nExplain how the use of pronouns (as discussed in the text) affects the style and clarity of a written message.\n- **Step 1**: Describe two specific pronoun cases (e.g., subject and object) as they relate to the text''s discussion on case of pronouns after ''be,'' ''as,'' and ''than.''\n- **Step 2**: Provide an example sentence where incorrect case usage could lead to ambiguity.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why proper pronoun case usage is essential for effective style, referencing the text''s explanation of how grammar choices impact message clarity.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the principles of pronoun case usage with the text''s discussion on style and clarity, using a clear example to illustrate your point.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Grammar Rules**\n\nAnalyze the grammatical correctness of the sentence: ''I saw him at the store with a camera.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify which grammar rule (e.g., pronoun case, end-focus, or subject-verb agreement) is being applied in this sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Explain why the sentence is grammatically correct based on the text''s discussion of grammar choices and style.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this sentence to a potentially incorrect version (e.g., ''I saw him at the store with a camera.''), and explain how the correct version adheres to the text''s principles of clarity and effective communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the grammar rule in question, its application in the sentence, and how it contributes to the overall style and clarity of the writing.'

    The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.

    If we put a subordinate clause at the end of a sentence, it receives greater
    emphasis. For example, [1] emphasizes the action of the committee members,
    whereas [la] emphasizes their feelings:

    [1] Although they were not completely happy with ut, the committee members
    adopted her wording of the resolution.
    [la] The committee members adopted her wording of the resolution, although

    they were not completely happy with it.

    Similarly, the pairs that follow show how we can choose which information comes
    at the end by the way we organize the sentence:

    Style
    [2] The American public is not interested in appeasing terrorists.
    [2a] Appeasing terrorists does not interest the American public.
    [3] On guard stood a man with a gun in each hand.
    [3a] A man with a gun in each hand stood on guard.

    [4] Teenagers are difficult to teach.
    [4a] It is difficult to teach teenagers.

    8.3 Front-focus

    If we place an expression in an abnormal position, the effect is to make the
    expression more conspicuous. It is abnormal for the verb and any objects or
    complements to come before the subject. If these are fronted, they acquire greater
    prominence:

    Attitudes will not change overnight, but change they will.
    Maryuana they used occasionally, but cocaine they never touched.
    Most distressing of all is the plight of the refugees.

    The same applies if an adverbial that normally follows the verb is fronted and
    therefore comes before the subject:

    Out you go.

    Here they are.

    Across the harbour stands a disused warehouse.
    In goal is Seaman for England.

    When a negative adverbial is fronted, it gains stronger emphasis. The operator
    comes before the subject, as in questions:

    Never have so many youngsters been unemployed.
    Under no circumstances will they permit smoking in public areas.

    8.4 There-structures and cleft sentences

    There-structures give greater prominence to the subject (cf. 6.11):
    There were some students who refused to show their ID card.

    They are particularly useful when the only other elements are the subject and the
    verb be:

    There are no simple solutions.
    There was no reason to be annoyed.
    There is more than one way to reach your customers.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Focus and Emphasis**\n\nGiven the sentences [1] and [la], explain how the placement of the subordinate clause at the end changes the emphasis from the action to the feelings.\n- **Step 1**: Identify which clause is the main clause in each sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how the position of the subordinate clause affects the emphasis on different parts of the sentence.\n- **Step 3**: Relate this to the text''s explanation that placing a clause at the end receives greater emphasis.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate an understanding of sentence structure and how clause placement influences emphasis, as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Fronting and Negation**\n\nRewrite the sentence "Most distressing of all is the plight of the refugees" using fronting to emphasize the negative adverbial.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the negative adverbial in the original sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the fronting rule described in the text to move it to the beginning.\n- **Step 3**: Ensure that the fronted part includes the operator, as in questions like "Never have so many...".\n**Answer Requirement**: Your rewritten sentence must correctly use fronting to emphasize the negative adverbial, and you must explicitly reference the text''s explanation of fronted negatives. '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with There-Structures**\n\nExplain the difference between the sentences ''There are no simple solutions'' and ''There is no simple solution.''\n- **Part A**: Identify the grammatical structure of each sentence.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the use of ''are'' vs. ''is'' affects the emphasis and meaning, as per the text''s explanation of there-structures.\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence using a there-structure that emphasizes the subject (e.g., ''There is no simple solution'') and explain why this structure is effective.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how subject emphasis works in there-structures and the role of verb agreement in shaping meaning.'

- prompt: |-
    Cleft sentences (cf. 6.12) give greater prominence to one part of the sentence by placing it after a semantically empty subject (72) and a semantically empty verb (de):

    It was human error that caused the explosion.
    It is the ending that is the weakest part of the novel.

    Similar effects can be achieved by using a nominal relative clause (cf. 6.9) or a general abstract noun:

    What caused the explosion was human error.
    The thing that caused the explosion was human error.
    What he forgot to do was to lock the front door.

    8.5 Parenthetic expressions

    Parenthetic expressions are marked by intonation in speech and by punctuation in writing. The effect of the interruption is to give greater prominence to the previous unit:

    Freud, of course, thought that he had discovered the underlying causes of many mental illnesses.

    The music business is ot, in actual fact, an easy business to succeed in.

    In Austraha, for example, the kangaroo is a traffic hazard.

    The unions, understandably, wanted the wage increase to be adjusted to rising inflation.

    CLARITY

    8.6 End-weight

    Where there is a choice, it is normal for a longer structure to come at the end of a sentence or clause. This principle of end-weight is in large part a consequence of the principle of end-focus (cf. 8.2), since the more important information tends to be given in fuller detail.

    A sentence is clumsy and more difficult to understand when the subject is considerably longer than the predicate. We can rephrase the sentence to shift the weight to the end:

    clumsy The rate at which the American people are using up the world's supply of irreplaceable fossil fuels and their refusal to admit that the supply 1s limited is the real problem.
    improved

    Style

    The real problem is the rate at which the American people are using up the world's supply of irreplaceable fossil fuels and their refusal to admit that the supply 1s limited.

    Similarly, if there is a considerable difference in length among the units that follow the verb, the longer or longest unit should come at the end:

    clumsy

    improved

    [4a] She told him in a calm voice that it was all a joke.

    Sometimes a sentence has more than one interpretation because an expression
    is positioned where it might belong in either of two directions. In [5], "on several occasions" may go with He said or with he suffered from headaches:

    [5] He said on several occasions he suffered from headaches.

    One way of showing it belongs with He said is to insert the conjunction ‘that' after
    it, since on several occasions will then be outside the boundaries of the subordinate
    clause:

    [5a] He said on several occasions that he suffered from headaches.
    The second interpretation is elicited in [5b]:
    [5b] He said that he suffered on several occasions from headaches.

    For [6], we can ensure the correct interpretation by moving again to unambiguous
    positions, as in [6a] and [6b]:

    [6] I told them again the meeting had been postponed.
    [6a] I again told them the meeting had been postponed.
    [6b] I told them the meeting had again been postponed.

    For [7], it would be best to rephrase the sentence as [7a] or [7b]:

    [7] Writing clearly is important.
    [7a] It is important to write clearly.
    [7b] It is clear that writing is important.

    Similarly, [8a] and [8b] clarify the intended meaning of the writer of [8]:

    Style

    [8] Looking at the ages of the subjects first proved not to be very useful.
    [8a] It proved not to be very useful to look first at the ages of the subjects.
    [8b] At first it proved not to be very useful to look at the ages of the subjects.

    8.8 Abstract nouns

    It is often possible to make a sentence clearer by rephrasing it to replace abstract
    nouns (or at least some of them) with verbs or adjectives:

Explain how rephrasing with ''again'' can clarify the intended meaning, as demonstrated in [6a] and [6b].\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly distinguish between the two interpretations and show how rephrasing can resolve ambiguity without referring to external sources.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Rephrasing for Clarity and Meaning\n\nThe sentence ''Looking at the ages of the subjects first proved not to be very useful.'' has two possible interpretations.\n- **Task A**: Rewrite the sentence in two different ways (similar to [8a] and [8b]) that clearly indicate the order of actions.\n- **Task B**: Compare your rephrased sentences to the original and explain how the change in structure affects the meaning.\n- **Task C**: Apply this principle to the sentence ''Writing clearly is important.'' Create two alternative sentences that clarify the relationship between writing and clarity, similar to [7a] and [7b].\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how sentence structure influences interpretation and show the ability to rephrase sentences for clarity.'

    8.9 Modifiers in noun phrases

    Readers may find it difficult to work out the meaning of a noun phrase that has two or more modifiers. If we are writing about American history, it may be obvious what we mean by American history teachers.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Redundancy and Conciseness in Writing**\n\nRewrite the following sentence to eliminate redundancy while preserving its original meaning: \"The charge that the industry is making excessive profits does not stand on a valid foundation.\"\n\n**Task**:\n- Identify the redundant words in the original sentence.\n- Replace them with a more concise expression using grammar concepts from the text (e.g., synonym replacement, preposition usage).\n- Justify your revision by referencing the text''s discussion on redundancy and improved phrasing.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your revised sentence must be grammatically correct, concise, and accurately reflect the original meaning without any reference to external materials.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Conditional Statements**\n\nConsider the following two conditional sentences: \"If the fox population were not controlled by fox-hunting, other techniques would have to be employed.\" and \"If the fox population were not controlled by the fox-hunting method, other techniques would have to be employed.\"\n\n**Task**:\n- Analyze the difference in meaning between these two sentences.\n- Determine whether they are logically equivalent or if one is more precise than the other.\n- Apply grammar concepts from the text (e.g., preposition usage, noun phrase clarity) to explain your conclusion.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly distinguish between the two sentences and demonstrate an understanding of how minor grammatical changes affect logical meaning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Grammar Concepts to Real-World Scenarios**\n\nThe text discusses how longwinded phrases can be simplified by replacing general words with simpler conjunctions or prepositions. Apply these principles to the following sentence: \"The entertainment aspect of reading is a factor in addition to the informative experience of reading.\"\n\n**Task**:\n- Rewrite the sentence using simpler language as suggested in the text.\n- Identify which grammar concepts from the text (e.g., conjunctions, prepositions) you used in your revision.\n- Explain how this revised sentence improves clarity and conciseness.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s grammar principles and show how they apply to real-world sentence restructuring.'

Committee members were individually contacted by phone or letter for their views on the draft, since the committee had been dissolved by the board. An entirely new committee was soon to be formed consisting of members from a different department within the university.\n\nIn [2] the problem is the string of thai-clauses:\n  \nStyle\n\n[2] She rehearsed the speech that she was to give to the committee that distributed funds that had been allocated for training the unemployed.\n\nWe can replace the last two ¢hat-clauses by converting them into non-finite clauses, as in [2a]:\n\n[2a] She rehearsed the speech that she was to give to the committee distributing funds allocated for training the unemployed.\n\n8.11 Parallelism\n\nParallel structures provide a pleasing balance between the parallel units, and they emphasize meaning relationships between the units such as equivalence and contrast. Parallelism often involves coordination. However, the coordinated units must be similar in type. Here is an example of faulty parallelism, where the coordinated units are dissimilar:\n\nfaulty They discontinued the production of the paint because the results of the field tests were unsatisfactory and a lack of interested customers. (clause and noun phrase)\n\ncorrected They discontinued the production of the paint because the results of the field tests were unsatisfactory and there was a lack of interested customers.\n\nThe text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson."
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Subordination and Clauses\n\nRewrite the following complex sentence using subordination and non-finite clauses, ensuring that each clause is clearly connected through appropriate subordinating conjunctions or non-finite forms.\nOriginal: She revised the report that she had written for the project, which required extensive research and was due by the end of the week.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify and replace the relative clause ''that she had written for the project'' with a non-finite clause.\n- **Part B**: Integrate the independent clause ''which required extensive research and was due by the end of the week'' into a subordinated clause using a subordinating conjunction.\n- **Part C**: Ensure that the sentence maintains the original meaning but is grammatically correct according to the principles of subordination and non-finite clauses discussed in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of both subordination and non-finite clauses, with explicit references to the examples in the text (e.g., ''non-finite clauses can replace relative clauses as shown in [2a]'').'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Analysis of Parallelism and Coordination\n\nCorrect the following sentence to achieve parallelism by ensuring that all coordinated units are of the same type (e.g., all nouns, all verbs, or all adjectives).\nOriginal: The committee discussed the proposal that was controversial and the members that were skeptical.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the problem with the original sentence regarding parallelism. Explain why this is an example of faulty parallelism as described in the text (clause and noun phrase).\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the sentence using parallel structure, ensuring that all coordinated units are of the same type (e.g., both noun phrases or both verb phrases).\n- **Part C**: Justify your correction using the principles of parallelism discussed in the text, such as the emphasis on equivalence and balance between coordinated units.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reflect a clear understanding of parallelism and its correction, with explicit references to the corrections shown in the text (e.g., ''the corrected version uses two noun phrases for balance'').'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Logical Reasoning with Sentence Structure\n\nGiven the text''s discussion of subordination and parallelism, construct a sentence that demonstrates both concepts. Your sentence must include:\n- A subordinated clause introduced by a subordinating conjunction (e.g., because, although)\n- A non-finite clause replacing a relative clause\n- Parallel structure in the coordinated elements of the sentence\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Write a grammatically correct sentence that incorporates all three elements.\n- **Part B**: Explain how each element (subordinated clause, non-finite clause, parallel structure) demonstrates the principles discussed in the text.\n- **Part C**: Compare your sentence to the examples in the text (e.g., [2a] and the corrected version of [2]) to show how your sentence aligns with the principles of subordination, non-finite clauses, and parallelism.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must show a clear understanding of all three concepts and their integration in sentence construction, with explicit references to the text''s examples.'

    Punctuation

    9.1 Punctuation rules

    The rules for punctuation are conventions that have been developed by printers and
    publishers. In large part, punctuation helps the readers to understand the written
    communication by breaking it down into smaller components. The conventions
    also contribute to the appearance of the printed page, notably through paragraphing.
    The conventions establish a measure of consistency for writers. Some conventions
    are obligatory: if we break them, we have made mistakes in punctuation. Others
    are optional: we can make better or worse choices in particular circumstances,
    depending on the effects we wish to convey. To that extent, punctuation is an art.
    Some punctuation marks are intended to represent pauses that we should make
    in our reading. In [1] below, the author has chosen to enclose three words in
    brackets to indicate that they are to be read with pauses on either side. The effect
    of the separating pauses is rhetorical: they emphasize the addition of or may not:

    [1] He may (or may not) vote for Mr Portillo as party leader.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Pronoun Agreement and Sentence Clarity**\n\nRewrite the following sentence to correct pronoun agreement issues while maintaining the original meaning: \n\n"If one can speak the language fluently, he can negotiate a better price."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must replace "he" with the correct pronoun and justify your choice based on subject-verb agreement rules.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Tense Consistency and Sentence Structure**\n\nRevise the sentence "Even though I had done all the work, I still do poorly in examinations." to ensure tense consistency and clarity.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must correct the tense discrepancy and explain how the revised sentence reflects logical progression in time.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Punctuation and Rhetorical Effect**\n\nExplain the rhetorical effect of the punctuation in the example: \n\n[1] He may (or may not) vote for Mr Portillo as party leader.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must analyze how the parentheses and commas contribute to the emphasis on uncertainty in the sentence, using the text''s explanation of punctuation conventions.

    But we do not always insert punctuation marks where we pause in speech. We
    would be likely to read or speak the sentence in [2] with a pause (or a break in our
    intonation) after the word development (and perhaps other pauses too):

    [2] A contemporary philosopher invited to consider relevant difficulties raised
    by modern urban development might think to approach the issues from
    the direction of either of the now well-established traditions of social
    philosophy or aesthetics.

    The punctuation system, however, does not allow a comma after development.
    There is a punctuation rule that forbids a comma between the subject and predi-
    cate unless the comma is the first of a pair of commas, as in [3]. Here parenthetic
    such as thistles and docks is separated by a pair of commas:

    [3] Some perennials, such as thistles and docks, were killed by ploughing and
    harrowing during the fallow summer period.
    184 An Introduction to English Grammar

    The rule forbidding a comma after development in [2] depends on the grammar
    of the sentence: the analysis of the sentence into subject and predicate. Some
    punctuation rules involve grammar and others involve meaning. We will be looking
    at such rules in the sections that follow.

    9.2 Sentence fragments and fragmentary sentences

    A sentence fragment is a set of words that is punctuated as a sentence even
    though it is not grammatically an independent sentence. Experienced writers can
    set a tone in their writing that allows them to violate the rules of punctuation
    through their intentional use of sentence fragments. When inexperienced writers
    violate these rules, their readers are given the impression that the writers do not
    know the rules. On the whole, it is safer for writers to avoid using fragments in
    formal writing until they are experienced enough to sense when it is appropriate to
    use them. Below are three types of sentence fragments to avoid. In each instance, if
    we replace the full stop, we also need to change the following capital to lower case.

    1. subordinate clauses

    The most vulnerable items are the keyboard, floppy disks, and printers. Because
    these are the items that people handle. [Replace the full stop with a comma. ]
    The percentage or letter-marking system is better than the pass/fail system.
    Because marks motivate students to work harder. [Omit the full stop or
    replace it with a comma. ]

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Punctuation and Grammar Rules**\n\nConsider the sentence: ''A contemporary philosopher invited to consider relevant difficulties raised by modern urban development might think to approach the issues from the direction of either of the now well-established traditions of social philosophy or aesthetics.''\n- **Task**: Apply the punctuation rule discussed in the text regarding commas between subject and predicate.\n- **Step 1**: Identify whether a comma should be placed after ''development'' based on the rule that a comma is only allowed between subject and predicate if it''s the first of a pair.\n- **Step 2**: Justify your answer by referencing the text''s example [3] where a pair of commas separates parenthetic material.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this rule relates to the grammatical structure of the sentence as analyzed in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference both the rule and its example from the text, and demonstrate an understanding of how grammar influences punctuation decisions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Sentence Fragment Rules**\n\nExamine the sentence fragment: ''The percentage or letter-marking system is better than the pass/fail system. Because marks motivate students to work harder.''\n- **Task**: Apply the rule that sentence fragments should not be used in formal writing unless appropriate.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the two types of sentence fragments present in this example (from the text''s list).\n- **Step 2**: Explain why replacing the full stop with a comma or omitting it is necessary based on the text''s instructions for changing following capital letters.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your reasoning by referencing the text''s explanation of how inexperienced writers are perceived when they use sentence fragments.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of both the types of sentence fragments and the rules for their proper use in formal writing.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Punctuation and Grammar**\n\nThe text discusses the distinction between punctuation rules based on grammar versus meaning. Consider the following two sentences:\n1. ''Some perennials, such as thistles and docks, were killed by ploughing and harrowing during the fallow summer period.''\n2. ''Some perennials such as thistles and docks were killed by ploughing and harrowing during the fallow summer period.''\n- **Part A**: Explain why sentence 1 uses a pair of commas to separate parenthetic material, while sentence 2 does not.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the punctuation rule in sentence 1 reflects a grammar-based rule, while the lack of commas in sentence 2 might indicate a meaning-based decision.\n- **Part C**: Construct an example of a sentence that could be punctuated differently based on either grammar or meaning, and explain how the choice of punctuation affects the interpretation of the sentence.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both grammar and meaning in your explanation of punctuation choices, demonstrating a clear understanding of the text''s distinction between the two types of rules.'

    Punctuation 185

    Sentence fragments are occasionally used in print, particularly in advertising, to suggest an afterthought or a dramatic pause, as in this extract from an advertise-
    ment for Intercity trains:

    Suddenly, a brilliant thought might strike. An idea for a game that could
    be bigger than Trivial Pursuit.

    Fragmentary sentences are sentences that are grammatically incomplete but
    can be completed from the verbal context (cf. 2.2). In written dialogue they are
    particularly common for responses, and their use in such contexts is perfectly
    appropriate:

    What did she tell you?
    To help myself to food. (‘She told me to help myself to food.')

    I heard you passed your driving test.
    After failing three times. (‘I passed it after failing three times.')

    De WS

    Fragmentary sentences are also common and appropriate in fictional description
    and narration:

    We've made a pact. A new start. No more philandering.
    [Paul Sayer, Howling at the Moon, p. 142. London: Constable, 1990]

An idea for a game that could be bigger than Trivial Pursuit.''\n- **Task A**: Explain how the use of two separate sentences (with a period and then a comma) contributes to the overall effect of the advertisement.\n- **Task B**: Compare this usage with the fragmentary sentence in the fictional example: ''We''ve made a pact. A new start. No more philandering.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must analyze the grammatical and stylistic purpose of sentence fragments in both contexts, referencing the text''s explanation of their use in advertising and fiction.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Coordinated Expressions and Punctuation\n\nExamine the sentence: ''They have abandoned their homes.

    In the next example (also from a novel), all the sentences except the first are
    fragmentary. The first sentence (ending in a semicolon) provides the clue to their
    interpretation. For most of them we would supply an initial She was, She had, or
    She had a to make them grammatically complete:

    Dr von Haller looked younger than I; about thirty-eight, I judged, for
    though her expression was youthful there was a little gray in her hair.
    Fine face; rather big features but not coarse. Excellent nose, aquiline if
    one wished to be complimentary but verging on the hooky if not. Large
    mouth and nice teeth, white but not American-white. Beautiful eyes,
    brown to go with her hair. Pleasant low voice and a not quite perfect
    command of colloquial English. Slight acccent. Clothes unremarkable,
    neither fashionable nor dowdy, in the manner Caroline calls ‘classic'.
    Altogether a person to inspire confidence. [Robertson Davies, The Deptford

    Fragments are commonly used in email messages, and in personal letters. The
    following extract is from a personal letter written while travelling on London
    Underground. The sentence fragments are in italics.

    186 An Introduction to English Grammar

    I guess. How are you today I wonder? Shit — Train resembles sardine can.
    But by some miracle I get a seat.

    [ICE-GB-W 1B-003-59ff ]
    As well as fragments, there is ellipsis (cf. 6.6) of determiners:
    (The) train resembles (a) sardine can.

    9.3 Run-on sentences and comma splices

    In [1] we have two separate sentences:

    [1] I used to be afraid of him. I have since got to know him well.

    We can join them into one sentence by simply putting a semicolon between them:
    [la] I used to be afraid of him; I have since got to know him well.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Fragments in Narrative Context**\n\nConsider the first paragraph from Robertson Davies'' *The Deptford Trilogy* where all sentences except the first are fragmentary.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the grammatical function of the first sentence (''Dr von Haller looked younger than I; about thirty-eight, I judged...'').\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how the subsequent sentences function as fragments, using the grammatical structures provided in the text (e.g., ''She was'', ''She had'', or ''She had a'').\n- **Step 3**: Justify how the combination of these fragments creates a coherent portrait of the character, and reference any examples from the text (e.g., ''Fine face; rather big features but not coarse'').\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of how fragments contribute to narrative style and character description, with explicit references to the text''s examples.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Ellipsis and Fragmentation in Non-Fiction**\n\nExamine the personal letter excerpt from the London Underground.\n- **Part A**: Identify two instances of sentence fragments and explain how they contribute to the tone and content of the message. For example, ''How are you today I wonder?''\n- **Part B**: Analyze the use of ellipsis in ''(The) train resembles (a) sardine can.'' and compare it to the fragmented sentences in the letter.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the use of fragments and ellipsis reflects the informal nature of the communication style in a personal letter.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts of fragmentation and ellipsis as discussed in the text, with specific examples from both the novel and the letter.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Sentence Structure**\n\nConsider the run-on sentences and comma splices discussed in the text.\n- **Part A**: Explain how joining two independent clauses with a semicolon (as in [la]: ''I used to be afraid of him; I have since got to know him well'') is different from using a comma splice (e.g., ''I used to be afraid of him, I have since got to know him well'').\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of a comma splice from the text and explain why it is incorrect.\n- **Part C**: Construct a run-on sentence using the structure from [1] (''I used to be afraid of him. I have since got to know him well'') and justify why it is grammatically incorrect.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of the distinction between correct and incorrect sentence structures, with explicit references to the text''s examples.'

- prompt: |-
    The general rule is that if we juxtapose sentences, as in [1] and [la] , we must
    use a major punctuation mark. The major punctuation marks are full stops (periods),
    question marks, exclamation marks, colons, semicolons, and dashes. If we fail to
    use any mark at all the resulting error is a run-on sentence, as in [1b]:

    [1b] I used to be afraid of him I have since got to know him well. [Correct by
    inserting a major punctuation mark after afraid of him.]

    Here are further examples of run-on sentences:

    It did not matter to me whether or not I had made an impact on the world
    I just wanted to learn as much as possible. [Insert a major punctuation
    mark after the world.]

    Ask the first person you see if they will help you I am sure they will.
    [Insert a major punctuation mark after help you.]

    If we use a comma instead of a major punctuation mark, the resulting error is a
    comma splice, as in [1c]:

    [1c] I used to be afraid of him, I have since got to know him well. [ Replace the
    comma with a major punctuation mark. |

    Punctuation 187
    The personal letter that we looked at in Section 9.2 also contains a comma splice:

    Don't know what I'm going to do now, his private waiting list is depress-
    ingly long. [Replace the comma with a major punctuation mark. |

    Here are further examples of comma splices:

    I visited them in their new home, it was a large apartment with a living
    room, kitchen, dining alcove, and two bedrooms. [Replace the comma
    after home with a major punctuation mark. ]

    I drifted towards vegetarianism, it was only partly for moral reasons.
    [Replace the comma after vegetarianism with a major punctuation mark. ]

    Comma splices are most likely to occur when a linking adverb (e.g. therefore,
    nevertheless) or a linking prepositional phrase (e.g. in spite of that, as a result) comes
    between the two sentences. A semicolon is the normal major punctuation mark if
    the two sentences are combined:

    [2] They lost the battle, nevertheless they were determined to continue the
    war. [Correct by replacing the comma with a major punctuation mark. |

    [3] The supply of houses grew more slowly than the number of new house-
    holds, as a result there was a giddy rise in prices. [Correct by replacing the
    comma with a major punctuation mark.]

    These linking expressions do not have to come between the two sentences. They
    can be moved elsewhere in the second sentence, as in [2a] and [2b]:

    [2a] They lost the battle; they were determined, nevertheless, to continue the
    war.
    [2b] They lost the battle; they were determined to continue the war nevertheless.

    There is one exception to the general rule. We may use commas between
    juxtaposed sentences if they are short and are similar in their structure, as in [4]:

    [4] The first problem is finding out what is important in life, the second
    problem is knowing how to apply this information in practice.

    The sentence may consist of just two parallel clauses involving a kind of com-
    parison, as in [5] and [6]:

    [5] The sooner he finishes, the better he will feel.
    [6] The more they earned, the more they wanted.

    188 An Introduction to English Grammar

    9.4 Coordinated main clauses

    Instead of juxtaposing sentences, we can often link them with a coordinator as two
    main clauses within one sentence. When we use a coordinator, we can put merely
    a comma between the clauses. In [1d] below, the coordinator but follows a comma:

    [1d] I used to be afraid of him, but I have since got to know him well.

    The central coordinators are and, or, and but. The marginal coordinators, which
    resemble the central coordinators in that they must come between the clauses, can
    also be used merely with a preceding comma: these are for, nor, so (‘therefore'),
    then (‘after that'), and yet. Here are examples with the three central coordinators
    and the other linking words:

    They were highly successful in the competition for grant support, and
    each grant provided jobs for technicians and other workers.

    He ought to admit that he is responsible for what he is doing, or he ought
    not to do it at all.

    The legal profession does not seem to have changed much, but in fact it
    has become much more democratic.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Sentence Structure with Coordinators**\n\nConsider the sentence: ''The sooner he finishes, the better he will feel.''\n- **Part A**: Identify the coordinator used in this sentence and explain why it is classified as a central coordinator rather than a marginal one.\n- **Part B**: Rewrite the sentence to incorporate a marginal coordinator (e.g., ''however'', ''nevertheless'') in a different position within the sentence, following the rules of punctuation discussed in the text.\n- **Part C**: Compare the structure of this sentence with the example provided in [4], where two parallel clauses are juxtaposed. How does the use of a coordinator affect the relationship between the clauses compared to using a semicolon or comma?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the distinction between central and marginal coordinators, as well as their appropriate usage in sentence structure.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Correcting Sentence Punctuation**\n\nThe text states that commas should be replaced with major punctuation marks in certain cases. Consider the sentence: ''The supply of houses grew more slowly than the number of new house-lds, as a result there was a giddy rise in prices.''\n- **Part A**: Correct the punctuation error by replacing the comma with an appropriate major punctuation mark. Explain your choice based on the text''s guidelines.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how this correction aligns with the rule about juxtaposed sentences and the use of commas between short, similar-structured sentences.\n- **Part C**: Provide an original example of a sentence that would require the same correction and explain why it is appropriate.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must correctly apply the punctuation rules from the text and demonstrate an understanding of when major punctuation marks are necessary in place of commas.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Linking Expressions**\n\nThe text discusses the use of linking expressions in sentences. Consider the following two examples: [2a] ''They lost the battle; they were determined, nevertheless, to continue the war.'' and [2b] ''They lost the battle; they were determined to continue the war nevertheless.''\n- **Part A**: Explain why ''nevertheless'' is correctly placed in [2a] but not in [2b], based on the text''s discussion of punctuation and linking expressions.\n- **Part B**: Create a new sentence that uses ''however'' as a linking expression in a position different from the examples provided. Ensure that your sentence adheres to the punctuation rules mentioned in the text.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the functions of ''nevertheless'' and ''however'' in these sentences. How do their placements affect the meaning and emphasis of the sentence?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s explanation of linking expressions and their appropriate placement within sentences, demonstrating a clear understanding of syntax and punctuation rules.'

    Peace is by no means assured, for several cabinet ministers are opposed to
    key paragraphs in the draft treaty.

    He is not a furniture designer, nor is he a shopkeeper.

    A storm damaged their radio, yet they were able to send messages.

    She was refused admission, so she complained to the manager.

    Check that the light is on, then push the knob inwards and turn to the
    setting that you require for cooking.

    The central coordinators may also link clauses without a punctuation mark,
    particularly if one or more of the clauses is short:

    We've all been asked to take more personal responsibility and people have
    responded to that challenge.

    We may want to use major punctuation marks between coordinated main clauses
    because they are long, because we want to emphasize that each clause is a separate
    unit, or because one or more of the clauses has internal commas:

    The kids are bored with tv; and they're bored with films; and they're
    bored with video games; and they're bored with computers.

    the fact that many of the measurements were made near urban areas,
    which tend to be warmer. But the measurements at sea are unreliable too,
    especially the older ones.

    On the other hand, we should not use a full stop or a semicolon to separate a
    subordinate clause from the main clause. Using a full stop results in a sentence
    fragment (cf. 9.2), and a similar mistake results from using a semicolon:

    He told the police that she has moved; although in fact she had died.
    [Replace the semicolon with a comma. |

    9.5 Direct speech

    We use direct speech when we report the actual words that somebody has said or
    written. It is normal to enclose direct speech in two pairs of either single or double
    quotation marks, an opening one or pair and a closing one or pair. Single quotation
    marks are more common.

    In dialogue, direct speech often comes with a reporting clause, such as she
    said. Sentences [1]-[3] illustrate the usual punctuation of direct speech with a
    reporting clause when the direct speech is a declarative sentence. The reporting
    clause can appear in one of three positions:

    [1] She said, "The solution is in your hands."
    [2] "The solution is in your hands," she said.
    [3] "The solution," she said, "is in your hands."

    When we report the original in our own words, we use indirect speech:
    She told us that the solution was in our hands.

    Rules for punctuating direct speech

    The following are the rules for punctuating direct speech with a reporting clause:
    (a) initial reporting clause, as in [4]

    It is usual to put a comma after the reporting clause and before the initial quotation
    marks:

    [4] She told them, ‘We should not waste food when millions are starving.'

    We may use a colon instead of a comma, particularly if the direct speech contains
    more than one sentence:

    190 An Introduction to English Grammar

    [5] He turned to me and said: ‘For the first time in my life I understood who
    I was and what I was doing and why I was doing it.'

    If the quotation is indented, it is not necessary to use quotation marks since the
    layout is a sufficient indication of direct speech.

    If the quotation ends the sentence, we put a full stop, a question mark, an
    exclamation mark, or a dash before the final quotation marks. The full stop is
    illustrated in [1], [3], [4], and [5]. The other three marks are illustrated in [6]–[8]:

    [6] The reporter asked, ‘Has the general arrived?'
    [7] The crowd cried, ‘Long live the President!'
    [8] She said, ‘I have done my share, but you —'

    The dash in [8] indicates that the speaker has stopped in mid-sentence.
    If the question mark or exclamation mark belongs to the sentence as a whole (not
    to the direct speech), it goes after the closing quotation marks:

    [9] Did she say, ‘It is against my religious principles'?
    [10] He actually said, ‘I am too busy to see you'!

    In the rare situation when the question mark or exclamation mark belongs both to
    the sentence and to the direct speech, use only one mark and put it before the
    quotation marks:

    Did she say, ‘Is it against your religious principles?'

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Conversion of Direct Speech to Indirect Speech**\n\nConvert the following direct speech into indirect speech using the rules provided in the text:\n- Original: "The solution is in your hands."\n- **Task**: Report the statement as a single sentence using indirect speech.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the reporting verb and determine if a comma or colon should be used.\n- **Step 2**: Adjust the punctuation according to the rules (e.g., place a full stop, question mark, or exclamation mark before the quotation marks if the statement is declarative).\n- **Step 3**: Ensure that the content of the quoted speech has been accurately paraphrased without changing its meaning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your final sentence must match the structure of [4] or [5], and correctly apply all punctuation rules described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Punctuation Rules for Direct Speech**\n\nExplain the difference between the following two sentences based on punctuation rules for direct speech:\n- [4] She told them, ‘We should not waste food when millions are starving.''\n- [9] Did she say, ‘It is against my religious principles''?'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Mid-sentence Cutoff in Direct Speech**\n\nAnalyze the sentence [8]: ‘She said, ‘I have done my share, but you —''\n- **Part A**: Identify the punctuation mark used at the end of the direct speech and explain its function according to the text.\n- **Part B**: Compare this punctuation with that in [6] and [7], explaining how the dash indicates a mid-sentence cutoff.\n- **Part C**: Construct an original example of direct speech that ends with a dash, following the rules described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reference all three examples [6], [7], and [8] and demonstrate a clear understanding of how punctuation marks function in direct speech.'

- prompt: |-
    (b) final reporting clause, as in [2]

    If the direct speech sentence would ordinarily end in a full stop, put a comma
    before the quotation marks:

    [11] ‘I'm not yet ready,' he replied.
    Otherwise, use a question mark or exclamation mark as appropriate:

    [12] ‘Do you know the way?' she asked.
    [13] ‘Lights! he screamed.

    The sentence may continue after the reporting clause:

    [lla] ‘Pm not yet ready,' he replied, and put down the telephone.
    [llb] ‘Pm not yet ready,' he replied; then he put down the telephone.

    (c) medial reporting clause, as in [3]

    The medial clause combines punctuation features associated with the initial and
    final reporting clause. The punctuation before the medial clause is the same as for
    the final reporting clause:
    Punctuation 191

    [14] ‘I'm not yet ready,' he replied. ‘You go ahead without me.' (cf. [11])
    [15] ‘Do you know the way?' she asked. ‘I'm lost.' (cf. [12])
    [16] ‘Lights! he screamed. ‘Give me lights!' (cf. [13])

    If the reporting clause interrupts a sentence, use a comma even if the sentence
    would ordinarily have no punctuation:

    [17] "When you are ready,' he said, 'let me know.' (cf. When you are ready, let
    me know.)
    [18] ‘I know,' he said, 'that they suspect me.' (cf. J know that they suspect me.)

    The punctuation after the medial reporting clause depends on whether the first
    part is an independent sentence. If it is, a full stop follows the reporting clause, as
    in [14]-[16]. If the reporting clause interrupts the sentence where the sentence
    would ordinarily have a comma or no punctuation, as in [17] and [18], then a
    comma follows the clause. If the reporting clause is placed where the sentence
    would ordinarily have a semicolon, the semicolon follows the reporting clause:

    [19] "The first two attempts to amend the constitution by convention succeeded,'
    the senator said; ‘the next two attempts failed.'

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Punctuation in Reporting Clauses\n\nConsider the sentence: ''The senator said, "The first two attempts to amend the constitution by convention succeeded, the next two failed."''\n- **Task A**: Identify and explain the correct punctuation marks that should be used in this sentence, referencing the rules for medial reporting clauses as outlined in the text.\n- **Task B**: Compare this with the example given in [19] from the text. Explain why the semicolon is used instead of a comma or period in this case, based on the text''s explanation of punctuation placement in medial reporting clauses.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must accurately apply the rules for medial reporting clauses and demonstrate understanding of how punctuation is determined by sentence structure and the position of the reporting clause.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Quotation Marks and Punctuation in Direct Speech\n\nRewrite the following sentence using correct punctuation and quotation marks, based on the guidelines provided in the text: ''When you are ready, let me know.'' He said.\n- **Task A**: Apply the rules for initial and final reporting clauses, including whether a comma should precede the quotation marks or if a question mark/exclamation mark should be used.\n- **Task B**: Explain why the original sentence structure may require different punctuation than the rewritten version, and how the reporting clause affects the placement of punctuation marks.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must correctly format the sentence according to the text''s guidelines and explain the reasoning behind the punctuation choices.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Complex Reporting Clauses with Multiple Interruptions\n\nConsider the following sentence: ''He said, "I know, that they suspect me," and then added, "I don''t believe it."''\n- **Task A**: Analyze the two reporting clauses in this sentence. For each clause, determine whether it is an initial, final, or medial reporting clause and explain why.\n- **Task B**: Apply the correct punctuation rules for each reporting clause, including any necessary commas or periods.\n- **Task C**: Compare this with the example given in [17] from the text. Explain how the placement of punctuation differs between the two examples and why.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must correctly apply the rules for all types of reporting clauses and demonstrate a thorough understanding of how punctuation is determined by the structure and position of each clause.'

- prompt: |-
    The punctuation at the end of the sentence is the same as for the initial reporting clause. We therefore have a full stop before the closing quotation marks in [14]–[15] and in [17]{19], and an exclamation mark in [16]. Here are two further examples:

    [20] ‘Did you say,' she asked, ‘that she would see me now?'
    [21] ‘I have done my share,' she said, ‘but you —

    (d) in general
    It is normal to start a new paragraph when there is a change of speaker, whether or not the direct speech is accompanied by a reporting clause:

    "What was in the letter?' she asked.
    ‘I can't tell you. I couldn't read it.'
    "Why not?"

    ‘It was in Spanish.'

    Use double quotation marks for a quotation within a quotation if you have used single quotation marks for the main quotation:

    ‘I said I'd take the job. Then I went to bed and thought, "What am I doing?" I don't want my children to say "He was a good football coach". I want them to think that I tried to do more than that.'

    192. An Introduction to English Grammar

    If the quotation is not in full, the punctuation mark that follows it comes after the quotation marks:

    The Colonel says he regards ‘the past 20 years just as an introduction'.

    He described the pleasure of seeing how deserts had become ‘not the Garden of Eden exactly, but a bit greener', though he made it clear that self-fulfilment was not his aim.

    Partial quotations draw attention to a significant part of what was said, and they may therefore be very brief:

    The newspapers carried reports of a famine of ‘biblical proportions' in Ethiopia.

    Sometimes the party sounds a little too enthusiastic about enforcing majority ‘rights'.

    In the last example the effect of inserting the quotation marks is to suggest that the writer does not accept responsibility for the appropriateness of the expression ‘rights' in this context.

    9.6 Citations

    We use words in a special way when we refer to them as words. Compare [1] with [2]:

    [2] Love can be either a verb or a noun.

    In [1] Jove is used in the normal way. In [2] it is the word /ove that is being
    discussed. When a word or phrase is cited — quoted or mentioned rather than used
    in the normal way — it is either put in double quotation marks or underlined.
    (Underlining in writing is the equivalent of italics in print.) If you use many such
    citations or if you need quotation marks for other purposes, it is clearer to use
    underlining rather than quotation marks. Definitions and translations of words and
    phrases are usually in single quotation marks:

    Perennial ‘perpetual' or ‘recurring' has its roots in the Latin per (‘through')
    and annus (‘year').

    Titles of works are also a special use of language. If the works are published or
    produced separately (for example, books, magazines, movies, musical compositions),
    they are underlined. But if the titles are for part of a larger work (for example,
    articles, chapters, short stories, songs), they are enclosed in single or double quotation
    marks:

    I read the report in the New York Times.

    My favourite Beatles song is ‘Eleanor Rigby'.

    Contrast:

    Hamlet is a complex character.

    9.7 Questions

    The general rule is that a question mark comes at the end of an interrogative
    sentence:

    Is our nation prepared for further sacrifices?
    The rule also applies to tag questions (cf. 6.2):
    She's in quite a good frame of mind, isn't she?

    It extends to declarative questions, which have the structure of a declarative
    sentence but function as a question (cf. 6.2):

    You know the rules?

    It is usual to put an exclamation mark at the end of an exclamatory question to
    ensure that it is read as an exclamation:

    Haven't you grown!
    Am I thirsty!

    It is usual to put a full stop at the end of a question beginning Would you that
    is intended as a polite request, particularly if the sentence is long. This usage is
    common in official letters. In this context the writer expects the fulfilling of the
    request, not a reply to the question:

    9.8 Restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses

    Relative clauses post-modify nouns (cf. 4.5):

    [1] the house that they bought last year
    [2] a student who belongs to our group
    [3] the place where we first met

    The three examples above are restrictive relative clauses. Restrictive clauses
    identify more closely what the nouns refer to. The house in [1] might be in contrast
    with the house that they used to live in. The student in [2] might be in contrast with
    a student who belongs to another group. The place in [3] might be in contrast with a
    place where we met last week.

    Non-restrictive relative clauses do not identify. They offer additional

    information:

    [4] their present house, which they bought last year,
    [5] Jean, who belongs to our group,

    [6] San Francisco, where we first met,

    The house in [4] is identified by their present. The person in [5] and the place in [6]
    are identified by their names. Names rarely need further identification, but it is
    possible to use a restrictive clause if further identification is necessary, as in [7]:

    [7] The Jimmy Robinson who was in my primary school class has just become a
    bank manager.

    Restrictive clauses should not be punctuated. Non-restrictive clauses, on the
    other hand, should be enclosed in punctuation marks. The usual punctuation is a
    pair of commas, as in [8], unless a major punctuation mark (cf. 7.3) would ordin-
    arily appear at the end of the non-restrictive clause, as in [9] and [10]:

    [8] The regulations, which took effect last year, list over 500 industrial pro-
    cesses and materials as hazardous.

    [9] Americans are becoming like Europeans, who prefer to buy goods that last a
    long time.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: The text discusses the difference between restrictive and non-restrictive relative clauses. Identify a situation where a non-restrictive clause could be used to provide additional information about a noun without changing the core meaning of the sentence. Construct an example using a proper noun, such as 'Paris', and explain why this clause is non-restrictive in context.
  finalExamQuestion2: Explain the grammatical rule that dictates whether a relative clause should be punctuated with commas or not, using examples from the text. Compare and contrast the use of restrictive and non-restrictive clauses in terms of their function, punctuation, and how they affect sentence meaning. Provide a clear example for each type.
  finalExamQuestion3: The text mentions that non-restrictive clauses may be followed by a major punctuation mark instead of commas. Create a sentence that includes both a non-restrictive clause and a major punctuation mark, as demonstrated in the text. Justify why this structure is grammatically correct and how it relates to the original sentence's meaning. Also, explain the potential ambiguity if the major punctuation mark were not used in this context.

- prompt: "[10] I have grown tired of my old stereo, which I bought 12 years ago; however,\nI can't afford to buy a new one.\n\nDashes or parentheses are sometimes also used to enclose non-restrictive clauses.\nDashes indicate dramatic pauses and parentheses separate the clause more distinctly.\n\nNon-restrictive relative clauses may refer back not only to a noun, but also to a\nprevious part of the sentence:\n  \nPunctuation 195\n\nHe failed his driving test, which must be discouraging.

    The civil servants often switch from English, the official language, to their native languages.

    196 An Introduction to English Grammar

    The relationship can be demonstrated by linking the two units with the verb be:

    English is the official language.

    The second unit is generally in apposition to the first.

    Like relative clauses (cf. 9.8), appositives are restrictive or non-restrictive: restrictive appositives identify more closely the preceding noun, whereas non-restrictive appositives offer additional information. And as with relative clauses, restrictive appositives are not punctuated, whereas non-restrictive appositives are enclosed in punctuation marks, normally a pair of commas but occasionally dashes or parentheses. Appositives may be either noun phrases or clauses.

    Here are examples of restrictive appositives:

    My brother John is an architect.

    Do you know the meaning of the word 'egregious'?

    I heard on the radio the news that Kabul had been attacked.

    The fact that she likes the job suggests that she will remain here for a long while.

    Here are examples of non-restrictive apposition:

    The genuine American hamburger, a ground beef patty served on a bun, was invented at the beginning of the twentieth century.

    The most reliable indication of Islam's revival is the observance of the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that devout Muslims are expected to make at least once in their lifetime.

    Scientists have discovered two sets of hydrothermal vents (ocean hot springs).

    His greatest service — the issue that made him famous — was the way he defused the crisis.

    The agency ignored their objection, that the anti-pollution measures would greatly increase the cost of the products.

    Like non-restrictive relative clauses, non-restrictive appositives can refer back to a previous part of the sentence, not merely to a noun phrase:

    9.10

- prompt: |-
    Clauses that function as adverbials in sentence structure are adverbial clauses (cf. 6.9). Adverbial clauses occur initially, medially, and finally. Medial position — the position between the subject and the verb — occurs relatively infrequently.

    Punctuation

    When adverbial clauses are punctuated, the normal punctuation marks are com-
    mas. In medial position, the clauses are enclosed in a pair of commas.

    Adverbial -ing and -ed clauses (cf. 6.8) are generally punctuated, whatever their
    position:

    Feeling unadventurous, I ordered chicken soup for my first course.

    My parents, needing money for extensive house repairs, applied for a second
    mortgage.

    His colleague worked in the corporate section, selling art to big firms.

    When asked to speak, he complained about the poor service.

    My wife, ot easily pleased, declared that the play was excellent.

    It is peaceful to float down a river, carried effortlessly by the current.

    Medial finite clauses are always punctuated:

    The members of the committee, when they read his report, demanded his
    resignation.

    Initial finite and infinitive clauses (cf. 6.8) are often punctuated:

    If the negotiations are held in public, they are likely to fail.
    As the canoe drew near, the design on its prow became visible.
    To push a wheelchair, you need muscle power.

    The punctuation of final finite and infinitive clauses depends on their relation-
    ship to the rest of the sentence. If they specify the circumstances of the situation,
    they are not punctuated:

    Call me zf you decide not to come with us.

    Security has been heightened since a porter was mugged.
    I recognized her talents before anyone else did.

    People often phone to thank me for my advice.

    If they provide additional information or a comment, they are punctuated:

    She walked fast, so that she arrived before us.

    They expelled him from the country, although he had not been charged with
    a crime.

    I have been studying every day past midnight, since I want to graduate
    this year.

    He was self-conscious in his casual clothes, as if he had appeared without
    socks for a formal reception.

    It's too large, if I may say so.

    The suit doesn't fit him, to tell you the truth.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Punctuation of Adverbial Clauses**\n\nAnalyze the sentence: "If the negotiations are held in public, they are likely to fail."\n- **Part A**: Identify the type of adverbial clause (initial, medial, or final) and explain how the punctuation is used according to the rules in the text.\n- **Part B**: Construct a similar sentence using an infinitive clause, ensuring correct punctuation.\n- **Part C**: Explain the difference in punctuation between a final finite clause (e.g., "I have been studying every day past midnight, since I want to graduate this year.") and a final infinitive clause (e.g., "To push a wheelchair, you need muscle power.")\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s rules on adverbial clause punctuation and demonstrate understanding of their positional effects on punctuation.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Adverbial Clauses**\n\nExamine the sentence: "He was self-conscious in his casual clothes, as if he had appeared without socks for a formal reception."\n- **Part A**: Determine whether the clause "as if he had appeared without socks for a formal reception" is an adverbial -ing clause or an adverbial finite clause. Justify your answer using the text''s definitions.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the punctuation used in this sentence with that of "My parents, needing money for extensive house repairs, applied for a second mortgage." Explain how the clause function and position affect punctuation.\n- **Part C**: Create a sentence that uses an adverbial -ed clause and explain why it is punctuated as it is, referencing the text''s guidelines.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of adverbial clause types and their respective punctuation rules as outlined in the text.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Adverbial Clauses**\n\nWrite a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) that includes three different types of adverbial clauses (initial, medial, final), each correctly punctuated according to the text''s rules.\n- **Part A**: Ensure that each clause is clearly identified as initial, medial, or final based on its position in the sentence.\n- **Part B**: For each clause, explain how its punctuation aligns with the text''s guidelines.\n- **Part C**: Analyze how the use of adverbial clauses contributes to the clarity and complexity of your paragraph.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must be grammatically correct and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of adverbial clause punctuation as described in the text.'

    The same applies to verbless clauses (cf. 6.8):

    If in difficulty, phone me.
    Her father, when a hotel manager, had to work overtime every night.
    The procedure was simple, though somewhat unpleasant.

    If the sentence is negative, the absence of punctuation indicates that the negation includes the adverbial clause. The distinction is particularly sharp for a because-clause:

    [1] He didn't go there because his sister was going to be there.

    The absence of a comma before the because-clause in [1] suggests the interpretation
    ‘He did go there, but not because his sister was going to be there'. On the other
    hand, the presence of a comma stops the negation from applying to the because-
    clause, as in [2]:

    [2] He didn't go there, because his sister was going to be there.

    The interpretation of [2] is ‘He did not go there, and he decided not to because his
    sister was going to be there'. The same interpretation applies if the because-clause
    is fronted:

    [2a] Because his sister was going to be there, he didn't go there.

    Adverbials other than clauses are often separated by commas if they provide a
    comment or have a linking function:

    Unfortunately, we were unable to attend your party.

    It was, quite frankly, a very boring speech.

    She was, in fact, a mathematical genius.

    None of the children liked the puppet show, to my surprise.

    Do you know her, by the way?

    His opinion, however, does not carry any weight.

    Rhetoric has started wars; on the other hand, rhetoric has stopped wars.
    In summary, his idea was neither original nor correct.

    9.11 Vocatives and interjections

    Vocatives are phrases — commonly names — that directly address the person spoken
    to. Vocatives resemble adverbials in their range of positions and are always separated by commas:
    Punctuation

    Mr Chairman, I want to second the motion.
    Can you tell me, Caroline, what I have to do next?
    Turn on the light for me, fean.

    Similarly, interjections and other reaction expressions are isolated by commas:

    Oh, we didn't expect to see you so soon.
    Well, what's your explanation?

    Yes, the finals will be next week.

    OK, we're ready.

    Commas may be needed to prevent readers from misunderstanding the sentence,
    even if only momentarily:

    Above all, discrimination is ethically indefensible. [Not a// discrimination. ]

    After cleaning, position the cutter centrally over the retaining clip and
    push downwards. [Not After cleaning position. |

    decisions.

    9.13 Genitives of nouns

    In writing we indicate that nouns are genitive (cf. 5.7) by using an apostrophe. The
    general rules for forming the genitive are:

    I.

    If the noun is singular, add °s.

    David David's brother
    the student the student's expectations
    the woman the woman 's options

    If the noun is plural and ends in -s, add just an apostrophe.
    the students the students' expectations

    my sisters my sisters' friends

    his parents his parents' address

    199
    200 An Introduction to English Grammar

    3. If the noun is plural and does not end in -s, add 's.

    the women the women's suggestions
    the people the people's decision
    the police the police's reactions

    There is some variation among writers about singular nouns ending in -s. On the
    whole, it is safer to follow the general rule and add 's:

    The boss's daughter Charles's video
    Burns's poetry Dickens's novels
    The traditional exceptions, which take just the apostrophe, are:

    1. the genitive of Jesus and Moses
    Jesus' teaching Moses' blessing

    2. names of more than one syllable that end in -s and have an ‘eez' sound:
    Socrates' death Xerxes' defeat

    In the fixed expressions for... sake where the noun in the middle ends in an ‘s'
    sound, the noun traditionally takes just the apostrophe:

    for goodness' sake for appearance' sake

    9.14 Genitives of pronouns

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Genitive Formation in English Grammar**\n\nConstruct the genitive form for each of the following nouns and pronouns, adhering to the rules provided in the text:\n1. David\n2. the students\n3. the women\n4. my sisters\n5. The boss\n6. Socrates\n7. Xerxes\n8. for goodness\n9. The traditional exceptions:\n- Jesus\n- Moses\n- the genitive of Jesus and Moses\n- names of more than one syllable ending in -s with an ''eez'' sound\n- fixed expressions for... sake\n\n**Task**: For each item, apply the correct genitive form as per the text''s rules. **Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include both the genitive form and a brief explanation of which rule applies, using terms from the text (e.g., ''add ''s'' for plural nouns not ending in -s'').'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Pronoun Genitive Formation**\n\nIdentify the correct genitive form for each of these pronouns, based on the text''s discussion of pronoun genitives:\n1. I\n2. He\n3. She\n4. They\n5. It\n6. We\n7. You (informal)\n8. You (formal)\n9. One\n10. The traditional exceptions: Jesus, Moses, and the genitive of Jesus and Moses\n\n**Task**: For each pronoun, provide the correct genitive form. **Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explain which rule applies to each pronoun, referencing the specific rules from the text (e.g., ''add an apostrophe to names of more than one syllable...'').'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Application of Genitive Rules**\n\nUsing the text''s rules for genitives, answer the following questions:\n1. Why does ''Socrates'' become ''Socrates'' in the genitive form, while ''Xerxes'' becomes ''Xerxes''?\n2. How would the genitive form of ''for goodness'' be written, and what rule from the text supports this?\n3. Provide an example of a noun that ends in -s but does not require an apostrophe in the genitive form, and explain why this is a traditional exception.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answers must clearly reference the specific rules and exceptions mentioned in the text, demonstrating your understanding of when to add an apostrophe and when not to. You must also construct a logical argument for each answer based on the text''s explanations.'

    Certain indefinite pronouns (cf. 5.25) have a genitive ending in 's. These are one,
    compounds ending in -one (e.g. someone), and compounds ending in -body (e.g.

    somebody):
    one's friend anybody's idea
    nobody's fault someone 's move

    In the combinations with else, 's is added to else:
    someone else's coat no one else's fault

    The indefinite pronoun other follows the general rule for nouns: the genitive
    singular is other's and the genitive plural is others':

    each other's letters
    one another's children

    the others' problems (the problems of the others)

    Possessive pronouns (cf. 5.19) ending in -s should not have an apostrophe:

    James Joyce's novel Ulysses describes the adventures of Leopold Bloom
    in Dublin on a single day, June 16, 1904 — now celebrated every year as
    ‘Bloomsday'. Bloom makes breakfast for his wife. Goes to a funeral. Goes
    to a newspaper office. Drinks. Gets into a fight. Thinks his wife is having
    an affair. She is. And so is Bloom. Flirts with a girl on the beach. Meets
    Stephen Daedalus. In a brothel. Goes home. Goes to bed. Not much
    adventure, you might think.

    Actually, the adventure is in the use of language. Most people think
    Ulysses is a difficult novel. And it is. But it is also a very rewarding one. If

    The law on the relationship between sporting bodies and players has reluctantly followed the changes in sports trying to adapt.

    Nowadays, most sporting discipline bodies have procedures to ensure fair hearings with lawyers present.

    Most sportsmen accept their punishment often before their club or team pressures them to do so.

    Even though courts are more prepared than they used to be to look at the way sporting bodies' decisions are reached, they will still be reluctant to interfere with them.

    People who have a contractual relationship with their sporting body can always go to court to claim a breach of contract if the circumstances fit.

    Most sports people however do not have that sort of direct contract with the body that regulates their sport.

    In football for instance the legal relationship is between player and club.

    So far the regulatory bodies have managed to keep control of their decisions without too much interference from the courts.

    English in Use

    10.1 Register variation

    In 1.6 we introduced the concept of grammatical variation according to communicative purpose, the context in which language is used, and according to whether the medium is writing or speech. Varieties of language associated with specific uses and communicative purposes are called registers. In this chapter we will examine the distinctive features of a range of registers, including conversation, unscripted monologue, sports commentaries, and emails.

    10.2. Conversational English

    Whether it is chatting among friends, among colleagues, or asking directions of strangers in the street, everyday, face-to-face conversation accounts for by far the greatest amount of language use. The following is an extract from a family conversation. The speakers are identified as A, B and C. A and B are a husband and wife respectively, and C is their adult daughter. The speakers are British, and the conversation was recorded in London in the 1990s. Pauses are denoted by the symbol <,> and overlapping segments are bracketed.

    A: Tm peeved about that giving her that window
    I was a fool
    I was wasn't growing seeds then of course
    B: What window
    5 C: Piece [ of glass |
    A: [ Her ] next door when she was down or something <,>
    A glazed uhm sash window

    C: [If you ] gave it to her Dad
    15 B: No

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Conversational Language Features**\n\nExamine the extract from the family conversation provided in the text. Identify and explain three distinct features of conversational English that are evident in this dialogue.\n- **Feature 1**: Analyze the use of <,> and brackets for pauses and overlapping speech. Explain how this reflects real-world communication patterns.\n- **Feature 2**: Discuss the informal vocabulary and phrasing, such as ''blasted seeds'' and ''glazed uhm sash window''. How does this contribute to the natural flow of a conversation?\n- **Feature 3**: Explain the use of contractions and incomplete sentences, such as ''Tm peeved'' and ''No you can''t blame her''. How do these elements enhance the spontaneity of spoken language?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text and demonstrate an understanding of conversational features without relying on external knowledge.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Register Variation in Everyday Communication**\n\nCompare and contrast the features of conversational English with two other registers mentioned in the text (e.g., emails and sports commentaries).\n- **Part A**: Describe one distinctive feature of conversational English that is different from emails.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the register of sports commentaries differs from conversational English in terms of formality, vocabulary, and structure.\n- **Part C**: Use the example from the conversation to illustrate how register variation affects the interpretation of meaning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts from the text and show a clear understanding of how different registers function in communication.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Inferential Reasoning about Language Use**\n\nBased on the text, infer how the content of the letters sent by South American officers to Amnesty might reflect differences in register and tone compared to the family conversation.\n- **Part A**: What might be the purpose of the letters to political prisoners that do not bear the Amnesty letterhead?\n- **Part B**: How might the informal tone of the family conversation contrast with the formal or more somber tone of the letters describing torture?\n- **Part C**: Use examples from both texts to explain how register variation can be used to convey different intentions or emotions in communication.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must draw directly from the text and demonstrate an ability to reason about language use without external reference.'

    The recording has been transcribed orthographically, that is, the words have
    been transcribed as they would appear in writing, observing the usual rules of
    spelling and capitalization, but without punctuation. At first glance, therefore, the
    extract appears to resemble writing, but this is simply an artefact of the transcrip-
    tion. Closer examination will reveal some important differences between speech
    and writing, and some characteristics that are unique to conversational English.

    The extract contains a great deal of overlapping speech. Typically, the end of
    one speaker turn overlaps with the beginning of the other turn. In these cases, the
    interruption forces the first speaker to yield the turn to the other speaker. In line
    34, however, speaker C overlaps with a pause in B's speech, but B does not yield
    the turn.

    The informal nature of this conversation can be seen at the level of vocabulary.
    Minor expletives like blasted and damn are used, as well as colloquial expressions
    like guid and her next door. Speakers B and C both address speaker A using
    vocatives (cf. 7.11):

    If you gave it to her Dad
    Well you can't blame her /ovey

    The extract also contains many items such as well, I mean, uhm and uh, which
    are sometimes termed ‘fillers' or discourse particles. The functions of these are
    various: the voiced pauses uim and uh allow the speaker time to think, while
    retaining the turn in the conversation. All three speakers use we// at the beginning
    of some of their utterances, often to signal a change of topic, or to introduce a
    salient new point:

    Well these damn plants have shot up in price...
    Well can't you buy a piece of glass...

    Well she's using it...

    Well it annoys me...

    Well you can't blame her...
    English in Use 211

    Other discourse particles which are commonly used in conversation include you
    know, sort of, and like.

    The unplanned nature of the conversation is revealed in several instances of
    non-fluency, including repetitions ("Yes because because I broke that window'),
    false starts (‘I got two but I I can't I think I left the other one up at Bow'), and
    hesitations (That just sh shows you...)

    All the speakers use a great many contractions, which are frowned upon in
    formal writing, but are very characteristic of informal speech:

    What you want's a little greenhouse (cf. What you want is...)
    What's happened to the door (cf. What has happened... )
    D'you know how much glass is now (cf. Do you know... )

    Unlike written English, many of the utterances in this extract are not complete,
    grammatical sentences, in the sense that we have defined this term. In other words,
    they do not display the canonical subject—predicate structure that we looked at in
    Chapter 3. Instead, the speakers use several fragmentary sentences (cf. 9.2):

    Piece of glass
    Almost opaque
    Or a clip frame

    Ellipsis (cf. 6.6) is a very common feature of conversational language. Ellipsis
    refers to the omission of grammatical units. They are omitted in the interests of
    economy. Since they can be recovered from the immediate context, there is no
    need to include them. Ellipsis of the subject (cf. 3.5) is particularly common,
    especially when the subject is J:

    Could've cleared that square yard... (cf. J could've...)
    Didn't want it (cf. J didn't...)

    In the following examples, both the subject and some or all of the verb phrase
    (cf. 4.11) have been ellipted:

    Still out there (cf. J is still out there)
    Cost a lot more now (cf. J would cost a lot more now)

    Another characteristic of conversation is the use of tag questions (cf. 6.2):

    You can't blame her for that really can you
    Absolute daylight robbery really aren't they
    ... that's got glass in it hasn't it

    212 An Introduction to English Grammar

    In each case, the function of the tag question is to seek agreement from the other
    speaker with what is said in the preceding part.

    Compared with writing, and with more formal, prepared speech, conversational
    English tends to be less complex syntactically. Even when they are grammatically
    complete, most of the utterances are simple sentences, without subordination. The
    following is an exception to this, since it contains two subordinate clauses (one
    introduced by because, the other by when):

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Informal Speech Features**\n\nAnalyze the sentence "What you want''s a little greenhouse" in light of the text''s discussion on contractions, ellipsis, and tag questions.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the contracted form used in this sentence, and explain how it aligns with the text''s claim that contractions are characteristic of informal speech.\n- **Step 2**: Determine if this sentence is an example of ellipsis, and justify your reasoning based on the text''s definition of ellipsis.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this sentence to a tag question (e.g., "You can''t blame her for that really can you") and explain how they both serve the purpose of seeking agreement or clarification in conversation.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the text''s definitions of contractions, ellipsis, and tag questions, and demonstrate an understanding of their role in informal speech.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Ellipsis and Subordination**\n\nConsider the sentence "Still out there" as an elliptical form of "J is still out there."\n- **Part A**: Using the text''s definition of ellipsis, explain why the subject "J" is omitted in this sentence.\n- **Part B**: Contrast this with the sentence "The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson," which contains two subordinate clauses. Explain how this sentence differs from elliptical speech in terms of syntactic complexity and function.\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence that combines ellipsis with subordination, using at least one subordinate clause. Justify how this sentence reflects the text''s discussion on both features.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts of ellipsis and subordination as presented in the text, with clear examples demonstrating their application.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Tag Questions and Sentence Structure**\n\nThe text discusses tag questions (e.g., "You can''t blame her for that really can you") and the canonical subject-predicate structure.\n- **Part A**: Explain why tag questions are used in conversational English, referencing the text''s explanation of their function.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the sentence "Almost opaque" from the text, and determine if it is a complete grammatical sentence according to the text''s definition. Justify your answer using the text''s criteria for complete sentences.\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence that uses both ellipsis and a tag question, and explain how this sentence exemplifies the text''s discussion on conversational language features.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s definitions and how they apply to real-world examples.'

    I brought that from Bow because I got it from the place next door when they
    threw their window frames out

    At the phrase level, too, informal conversation tends to be simple. Many of the
    noun phrases (cf. 4.2) in this extract consist of a noun only (g/ass), a noun together
    with one determiner (a fool, the shed) or a noun and a pre-modifier (frosted glass, fancy
    glass). In this extract, pre-modifiers are far more common than post-modifiers.
    When post-modifiers do occur, they are often simple prepositional phrases (cf.

    4,25) introduced by of:

    a piece of glass
    a box of seeds

    In the following noun phrase, the post-modifier is a clause:
    the door we had out there

    This is a relative clause (cf. 4.5), or more accurately a zero-relative clause (cf.
    5.24), since the relative pronoun has been omitted. This omission of the relative
    pronoun is very common in conversation, but less common in more formal con-
    texts, where we might expect to find

    the door that (or which) we had out there

    In 1.6 we noted that one of the factors involved in grammatical variation is the
    attitude of the speaker towards his or her audience, towards the topic, and towards
    the purpose of communication. In more general terms, we can say that in conver-
    sation, a major factor is the relationship between the speakers. The extract above
    is from a family conversation — the speakers are all very familiar with each other,
    and the conversation is informal, relaxed, and at times ‘jokey'. We would expect
    a rather different type of conversation between, say, a student and his supervisor,
    or between an employee and his employer.

    Our second extract is from a counselling interview. Speaker A is a male univer-
    sity student, aged 19, and speaker B is his counsellor, who is also male, aged
    around 50. Again, the symbol <,> denotes a pause and overlapping strings are
    bracketed.

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Noun Phrase Structure in Informal Conversation\n\nAnalyze the noun phrase ''a piece of glass'' from the text. Explain how its structure differs from the noun phrase ''the door we had out there'' in terms of pre-modifiers and post-modifiers.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the type of noun phrase each example represents (pre-modifier vs. post-modifier).\n- **Step 2**: Justify your classification based on the definitions provided in the text (e.g., ''pre-modifiers are more common in informal conversation'').\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the omission of the relative pronoun in ''the door we had out there'' reflects the speaker''s attitude towards their audience and purpose of communication, as discussed in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference both noun phrase structures and the speaker''s attitude, as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Application of Grammatical Variation in Conversational Contexts\n\nCompare the two extracts provided in the text. One is from a family conversation, and the other is from a counselling interview.\n- **Part A**: Identify three features of each extract that demonstrate grammatical variation based on the relationship between speakers.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the use of relative clauses (e.g., ''the door we had out there'') versus full relative clauses (''the door that we had out there'') reflects the level of formality and familiarity between speakers.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the text''s emphasis on speaker attitude towards audience and purpose influences the choice of grammatical structures in each extract.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both grammatical features and the speaker''s attitude as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Logical Reasoning with Noun Phrase Modifications\n\nConsider the noun phrases ''frosted glass'' and ''a box of seeds''.\n- **Part A**: Explain why ''frosted glass'' is classified as a pre-modifier noun phrase, while ''a box of seeds'' is a post-modifier noun phrase.\n- **Part B**: Construct an example of a noun phrase that would be considered a post-modifier based on the text''s definitions.\n- **Part C**: Analyze how the use of post-modifiers in ''a piece of glass'' versus pre-modifiers in ''frosted glass'' affects the clarity and informality of the language, as discussed in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference both pre- and post-modifier structures, as outlined in the text.'

    tag questions:
    ... that's a big step forward isn't it
    and finally contractions:

    ...l've got to grips... (cf....Z have got to grips...)
    ... youre getting on top of the work (cf... . you are getting... )
    ... that's in seminars... (cf.... thatis...)

    However, it is noticeable that all of these features are much less frequent than in
    the family conversation. There are also far fewer overlaps; because of the purpose
    of the exchange, and the relationship between the participants, the speakers rarely
    interrupt each other. On the other hand, there are far more pauses. These allow
    the student time to frame a response to the counsellor's questions, and they give
    the counsellor time to consider his next question.

    Compared with the family conversation, the counselling interview appears much
    more fluent, with much longer and much more complex utterances. In fact, almost
    all the utterances in the counselling interview are complex sentences, that is, they
    contain at least one subordinate clause. For example, Speaker A's first utterance is
    a complex sentence:

    I wish I could feel more relaxed...

    Here, the subordinate clause J could feel more relaxed ... functions as the direct
    object (cf. 3.7) of the verb mish. In a more formal context, such as in writing, the
    subordinate clause would be introduced by that:

    I wish that I could feel more relaxed...

    Here, we will list and describe some of the other complex sentences in the
    counselling interview. The subordinate clauses are underlined:

    Yeah but I would like to improve it

    (to-infinitive clause functioning as direct object of the verb ke)

    It <,> can still be improved even if it is fairly good

    (if-clause functioning as adverbial (cf. 3.9))

    So you now feel that you're getting on top of the work

- prompt: "The people upstairs  \nThe day before  \nThe way back  \n\nOne further aspect of the counselling interview is worth noting. In asking  \nquestions, the counsellor makes frequent use of declarative questions (cf. 6.2).  \nDeclarative questions have the formal characteristics of a declarative sentence, but  \nthey are in effect questions. In lines 17f. the counsellor uses three declarative  \nquestions in rapid succession:  \n\nAnd that's in seminars and lectures  \n\nB: So you now feel that you're getting on top of the work  \nA: Yes  \n\nB: Uhm <,> and uh you understand what's going on  \n\nA: Yes <,>  \n\nB:  \n\nA:  \n\nWe don't uh have seminars as such  \n\nBecause of the context, speaker A has no difficulty in interpreting each of these as  \nhaving the force of a question, despite their declarative form.

In face-to-face conversation, the relationship  \nbetween the speakers is a significant factor, as are the age and sex of the speakers. The  \nspeakers' educational background is also an important factor.

     This unscripted monologue displays many of the characteristics that we saw in
    the family conversation and in the counselling interview (10.2). There are many
    pauses, and many voiced pauses, which have been transcribed as uf and uhm. In
    line 1 there is a contraction fo've (to have). There are also many non-fluencies.
    These include false starts:

    ... the consequence of that was <,> that at <,> fairly frequently...
    and self-corrections:
    Uh the uh beams the stacks were liable to become unstable . . .

    The speaker uses the discourse particle now to introduce new points in his
    description of events and, in line 28, he uses well now to introduce his final
    question, which in a sense is the culmination of his speech.

    In describing the facts of the case, the judge presents a series of events as a
    sequence of clauses which are loosely connected by and:

    Beams were taken away from one side

    and

    the stack was leaning to some extent then over the stack would go
    and

    the beams would all fall to the ground

    This use of and is very common in continuous speech. However, it does not
    perform any real coordinating role in this case; it is simply used to string together
    a series of clauses.

    In line 3 there is a parenthetic clause / think (cf. 7.18), but lines 7f. contain a
    much longer parenthesis:

    the <,> ground <,> was plainly <,> uh uh and this seems to have been uh
    common ground between the witnesses who were called in this case <,> uhm a
    bad place for <,> stacking <,> uh these lintels and beams

    The parenthetic clause occurs between the verb (was) and the subject complement
    (a bad place for stacking these lintels and beams). Such a long parenthetic clause
    would be unusual in formal writing. If it did occur, it would be enclosed in
    brackets or marked off from the rest of the sentence using dashes.

    Line 16 contains an interesting example of fronting (cf. 8.3):
    ... then over the stacks would go...

    Here, the adverb over (part of the phrasal verb go over) has been moved to a position before the subject in order to give it greater emphasis. The result is a more 'dramatic' description of the accident. Compare this version with the conventional word order, which is a much more 'flat':

    ... then the stacks would go over...

    The effect of fronting is to make the fronted element more conspicuous, and to give it more dramatic focus. Compare:

    Twenty pounds it cost me. (fronted)
    It cost me twenty pounds. (normal word order)

    10.4 Sports commentaries

    Sports commentaries are also a type of unscripted monologue. They offer an interesting example of language use because in them the commentator has to describe events which happen as he is speaking, and over which he has no control. In many sports, the action is very fast, and events succeed each other in rapid succession. The commentator therefore must be able to react quickly under great pressure, and he must describe events coherently without having any time to prepare or rehearse. Sports commentaries therefore offer us interesting examples of truly spontaneous and public language use.

    The extract below is from a radio commentary on an FA Cup match between Manchester United and Queen's Park Rangers.

    Barker, Wilkins, Wilson and Sinton in midfield and up front. Falco and Wegerle and the ball at the moment with Paul Ince who chips it forward. Bardsley going across quickly as Mark Hughes lurked to knock it forward. It's chested down here by Steve Bruce just inside his own half, chipping the ball forward.

    It's knocked down by McClair for Bryan Robson delighted to be back in the United line-up today and he spreads it out to the left now to Lee Sharp. Sharp goes past his man.

    Gets to the by-line.

    He's inside the penalty area.

    He's made up a lot of good ground there before a vital interception came in

    from Clive Wilson and that now earns Manchester United another corner kick away on that far side their left and it'Il be Neil Webb who goes across to take it with Brian McClair waiting at the near post.

    Mark Hughes just on the edge of the six-yard box.

    Sharp, Robson, Pallister and Bruce all waiting along the edge of the eighteen-yard area.

    The corner coming out towards Pallister.

    He knocks it in there.

    McClair gets a good shot from Bruce.

    It cannons off a defender.

    Comes to the left of the Queen's Park Rangers goal and Roy Wegerle now keeps the ball in play as he comes away from his own penalty area and drags the ball up to the halfway line.

    Tackle coming in from Denis Irwin there and as Bruce picked it up he was fouled.

    Free kick to United just inside the Rangers' half.

    Irwin has got the free kick in there.

    It's knocked back <,> by Danny Maddox and going out to the far side flicked forward by Justin Channing but then knocked forward for United by Webb.

    Interception coming in now and Wilkins now brings it away <,> as they make the break forward with Bardsley.

    Bardsley now facing a challenge from Paul Ince puts a short ball back to Barker and he goes back out to Wegerle on the far side.

    A good idea to set Barker away again but a vital interception coming in from Blackmore and now United move forward.

    It's with Brian McClair.

    McClair moves down the centre.

    In this extract it is very noticeable that the length of the units corresponds
    closely with the speed of the action being described. During periods of intense, fast
    action, the utterances are very brief and 'telegraphic' in style, as the commentator
    tries to keep pace with the action. During less intense periods — when there is a lull
    in the game — the commentator has more time to produce longer and grammatically
    more complex utterances.

    In the 'telegraphic' utterances, there is a great deal of ellipsis, including ellipsis
    of the main verb:

    Steskal in goal (cf. Steskal zs in goal)

    Channing Bardsley Maddox and Sampson at the back (cf... . ave at the
    back)

    The ball currently inside the centre circle . . . (cf. The ball 7s currently . . . )

    ... the ball at the moment with Paul Ince... (cf. the ball at the moment

    There is also ellipsis of determiners (cf. 5.26) in some noun phrases (cf. 4.2):

    Tackle coming in... (cf. A tackle...)
    Free kick to United .. . (cf. A free kick...)

    The use of progressive aspect (cf. 4.14) is very striking in this commentary,
    but the progressive auxiliary be is usually ellipted:

    Steskal going up... (cf. Steskal zs going up... )
    United tonight playing with a familiar line-up (cf. United are playing... )
    The corner coming out... (cf. The corner is coming out... )

    Ellipsis allows the commentator to speak quickly in order to keep pace with the
    action, while having no detrimental effect on comprehensibility.

    In terms of clause relationships, the ‘telegraphic' style of a sports commentary
    may be described as a kind of loose ‘stringing together' of short clauses or other
    units, with no grammatical relation between them:

    222 An Introduction to English Grammar

    Played forward by Robson

    Hughes tries to lay it off for McClair
    Comes back now for Neil Webb
    Webb wisely spots Irwin in space
    Chipped into the middle by Irwin

    This loose ‘stringing together' of units, without any grammatical relation between
    them, is called parataxis. It is contrasted with hypotaxis, which refers to rela-
    tions between units based on coordination or subordination (cf. 6.10).

    Sports commentaries typically contain a large proportion of passive construc-
    tions, often followed by a by-phrase (cf. 4.15):

    It's knocked back <,> by Danny Maddox
    ... flicked forward by Justin Channing
    but then knocked forward for United by Webb

    We can compare these passive constructions with their active counterparts:

    Danny Maddox knocks it back
    Justin Channing flicks it forward
    Webb knocks it forward for United

    In the active construction, the subject (the name of the player who is performing
    the action) comes first, followed by the verb. In the passive construction, this
    information is postponed to the end of the clause, where it occurs in the by-phrase.
    The passive construction therefore gives the commentator more time to identify
    exactly which player is involved in the action. We might refer to the use of the
    passive here as a type of ‘delaying tactic' on the part of the commentator. Delaying
    tactics are particularly important in a radio commentary, where even a brief silence
    can be very disconcerting to the listeners. The commentator must keep speaking more
    or less all the time, even when he is unsure about what is happening on the field.

    Here is another example of a delaying tactic:

    ... and quickly in there was Barker
    Here, the commentator uses a changed word order to ‘buy time' for himself, until
    he has identified the player involved in the action. Compare this construction with
    the more usual:

    ... and Barker was quickly in there

    The following is the clearest example in this extract of a delaying tactic. As one player is about to be substituted, the commentator does not yet know who his replacement is going to be. However he keeps speaking until he has identified the substitute:

    ...and we're going to see J think the introduction after just twelve minutes of Alan McCarthy

    The commentator is quite obviously 'buying time'. He first uses a parenthetic clause I think (cf. 7.18), and then an adverbial after just twelve minutes (cf. 3.9). These are inserted into the noun phrase the introduction of Alan McCarthy, between the noun (introduction) and the post-modifier (of Alan McCarthy). This is very untypical of general language use. Typically, a noun is immediately followed by its post-modifier (cf. 4.4). In the sports commentary, however, the strategy clearly serves the very useful purpose of 'buying time' for the commentator.

    10.5 Email English

    An estimated 6.1 billion emails are sent out daily around the world, and the figure continues to increase. In the last decade, email has become an important communication tool, and email communication is already recognized as a linguistic register in its own right, even if its conventions are not yet fully fixed. Email is a written form of language, but it is not simply a letter in electronic form. It also has many of the characteristics of speech. However, we will begin by looking at some of the features that emails share with other forms of writing, especially letters.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Delaying Tactics in Language Use**\n\nAnalyze the sentence: ''...and we''re going to see J think the introduction after just twelve minutes of Alan McCarthy'' from the text.\n- **Part A**: Identify and explain two grammatical features (e.g., parenthetic clauses, adverbial phrases) that are used in the sentence to ''buy time'' for the commentator.\n- **Part B**: Compare this linguistic strategy with typical language use, as described in the text. Justify why such structures are more common in sports commentary than in everyday conversation.\n- **Part C**: Construct an original example of a sentence that uses a similar delaying tactic, and explain how it serves the same purpose as in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the specific features mentioned in the text and their functional role in communication.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Email Communication as a Linguistic Register**\n\nBased on the text''s discussion of email as a linguistic register, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: Compare and contrast email communication with traditional written forms (e.g., letters) as described in the text.\n- **Part B**: Identify two conventions of email that are not typically found in letters, and explain their significance in the context of digital communication.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s argument about email being ''not simply a letter in electronic form'' relates to its use as a speech-like communication tool. Provide an example of how this duality is evident in email writing.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts from the text and demonstrate an understanding of email''s unique characteristics.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Language Features**\n\nThe text discusses the use of parenthetic clauses and adverbial phrases in language. Consider the sentence: ''The book is on the table, I think.''\n- **Part A**: Explain how this sentence differs from a typical structure in terms of grammatical features.\n- **Part B**: Use this example to argue why such structures are more common in specific contexts (e.g., sports commentary, informal writing) than in formal writing.\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence that intentionally uses a parenthetic clause to alter the meaning or emphasis of the main clause, and explain how this technique is used in real-world communication.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s discussion on language structures and their functional purposes.'

    As a linguistic register, email is still very much in a development stage; usage varies, and many users of the medium are still unsure about what the conventions are. For example, in writing a letter, we know the convention of starting with Dear John or Dear Sir, and ending with a salutation such as Best wishes or Yours sincerely. The conventions are less clear in emails. Users are still often unsure whether to use Dear John, Hi John, or simply John —. Much depends, of course, on the relationship between the sender and the recipient. Among close friends, a wide range of openings can be observed, including Hi, Yo, and Hey. However, if the recipient is not personally known to the sender, many writers still tend to use the more traditional ‘Dear...' and ‘Yours sincerely'. In circulars, or emails to a mailing list, Dear all or Dear List Members are commonly used.

    Speed is an important aspect of email communication. This refers both to how emails are delivered and also to how they are composed. Unlike a letter, which may take days to arrive, an email may be read almost as soon as it is sent. As a result, the sender may receive a reply very quickly, and so a rapid back-and-forth exchange of emails can be entered into. Emails tend to be written very quickly. They are typically brief, and many writers use abbreviations to speed up the act of composition. These include

    thx (thanks)
    u (you)
    BTW (by the way)
    FYI (for your information)
    b4 (before)
    CU (see you)

    Some writers dispense with upper case letters altogether, since the upper case requires an additional key stroke:

    t met john on monday.

    On the other hand, an email typed entirely in upper case letters is considered to be a breach of ‘netiquette', since the reader interprets it as the equivalent of shouting in speech. A limited use of capitalization is generally acceptable, if it is used to give emphasis:

    We're taking Libby to the doctor this morning to find out why she's
    eating SO MUCH! .. . she's becoming quite a blimp

    Writers of emails are generally unconcerned with spelling errors or ‘typos'; only
    the most careful writers will re-read and edit their emails before sending them. On
    the part of readers, there is much greater tolerance of spelling errors in emails than
    in handwriting or print. This is somewhat ironic, since electronic spellcheckers
    make it easier to check an email than it is to check any of the more traditional
    forms of written communication.

    Speed of composition, and the typical brevity of emails, may be factors in what
    many people perceive as a certain terseness in email messages, even when no such
    thing is intended. An email is more likely to be misinterpreted than a letter, For
    that reason, people sometimes use smileys or emoticons to indicate their intention,
    or to clarify how their remarks are to be interpreted. Emoticons represent the facial
    expressions of the writer:

    :-) smile
    :-( frown
    -) wink

    Some writers explicitly describe their own facial expressions by inserting <grins>,
    <smiles>, or <laughs>. Similarly, ‘LOL' (‘laughing out loud') has become a
    common tag in personal emails. Idiosyncratic spellings are sometimes used to
    emulate certain aspects of speech:

    This is just sooooooo boring.
    Going to (yaaaaaaaaaawn) Dublin at the weekend.

    English in Use 225

    Here, the idiosyncratic spellings are used to represent extended vowel sounds, and
    thereby to give added emphasis to what is being expressed. All of these strategies
    are intended to compensate for a perceived deficiency in email communication, in
    comparison with face-to-face conversation, where a great deal of the meaning is
    communicated by the speakers' facial expressions, gestures, stress, and intonation.

    Other features of speech are also regularly represented in emails, by various
    means. Most notable among these is the very common use of interjections and
    discourse particles:

    ... by the way — you know the Britannica we bought for, eh, Elizabeth?
    well, it arrived last week (30 vols) — we spent some time in Don's shed
    opening the boxes and having a look at it — ke... wow!!!

    In this example, some quite complex sentences alternate with brief, fragmentary sentences. The complex sentences are used to express the main business of the message, which is to make travel arrangements. However, it is quite unlike a business letter. We can see this in the informality and casualness of the language (see ya), and in the throwaway line beginning with "Whatever...", which suggests that the writer is not unduly worried about his travel arrangements. While maintaining an informal and friendly tone, this email still succeeds in conveying the most important information.

    Apart from personal messages, email is probably most often used in the workplace, as a means of communication among colleagues. In this case, the usual formalities of a letter, such as 'Dear...', are often dispensed with altogether, leaving only the business in hand. The following is an exchange between two colleagues:

    I'm trying to delegate a few duties, as I simply don't have the time to do everything myself!

    Thanks, — Charles

    >Charles,

    >My CD Writer isn't working just now, among other technical problems,
    >so I'd be grateful if you could send copies to the people concerned.
    Gerry—T'll be happy to do this.

    The sole purpose of this exchange is to conduct business, although it is very different from traditional communication by business letters. The greetings and salutations are brief, and are not used consistently. Both writers use contracted forms, such as I'll, I'd, and don't. These features contribute to the informal and friendly tone of the exchange. On the other hand, the 'business-like' nature of the communication can be seen in the fact that all the sentences are grammatically complete. There is no ellipsis of the subject, which is very common in more informal contexts. The objective of both writers is to convey information, and for that reason most of the sentences display a high degree of complexity at both the clause level and the phrase level:

- prompt: |-
    The clause to delegate a few duties is a to-infinitive clause, functioning as direct
    object of the verb trying. The clause as .. . myself is an adverbial clause, expressing
    reason. Finally, the noun fume is post-modified by the to-infinitive clause to do
    everything myself.

    My CD Writer isn't working just now, among other technical problems,
    so I'd be grateful if you could send copies to the people concerned.

    This sentence consists of two clauses coordinated by the marginal coordinator so
    (cf. 7.4). The first clause is simple, though it contains two adverbials, just now and
    among other technical problems. The second clause is complex: it contains an adver-
    bial to-clause, expressing condition. The complex noun phrase the people concerned
    has the following structure:

    determiner noun post-modifier
    the people concerned

    The post-modifier is a reduced relative clause, in which the relative pronoun is
    ellipted, and the verb phrase is non-finite (cf. 6.9). Compare:

    the people who are concerned
    The final sentence contains a complex adjective phrase (cf. 4.21):
    I'll be happy to do this.
    Here, the to-infinitive clause functions as post-modifier of the adjective happy.

    10.6 The language of literature

    Most of what we find in the language of literature — particularly in prose fiction
    and drama — we also find in other uses of language. Writers select from what is
    available in the language as a whole. Poetry, however, often departs from the
    norms of language use in two respects: (1) in deviations from the rules and con-
    ventions of ordinary language, and (2) in excessive regularities. For that reason, I
    will be drawing my examples from poetry. At the same time, it must be said that
    some poets are more inclined than others to keep close to everyday uses of lan-
    guage, perhaps even to simulate the style of natural conversations.

    The deviations that we encounter in poetry are located in various aspects of the
    language. Poetry is distinctive visually. It is set out in lines that do not go right

    Across the page. Spaces may be left between sets of lines to indicate the beginnings
    of new sections, and lines within sections may be indented in various ways to
    indicate connections of some kind, perhaps in rhyme or metrical pattern. The
    traditional verse convention is for each line to begin with a capital letter, but some
    modern poets defy this convention. Some modern poets also defy the ordinary
    language conventions of spelling and punctuation. In this respect, e.e. cummings is
    particularly idiosyncratic: for example, he regularly writes the first person singular
    pronoun as ‘i' and he sometimes inserts a punctuation mark in the middle of a
    word.

    Poets often create new words. These tend to follow the normal rules for word-
    formation rather than being deviant. Some eventually enter the general language.
    But new words are surprising at their first appearance and they may never be
    admitted to the general vocabulary, particularly when they are based on word-
    formation rules that are little used. Gerard Manley Hopkins seems to have in-
    vented unfathering (‘depriving of a father'). He describes how the snow ‘Spins to
    the widow-making unchilding unfathering deeps'. The new word and its sense
    are prepared for by the more transparent midow-making and the parallel unchilding
    (an existing word, though uncommon). Hopkins has combined the prefix un- with
    a noun to form a verb unfather in a deprivative sense. This is a rule of word-
    formation that is little used. Even more rare is the formation of a negative noun by
    prefixing un- to an existing noun. Thomas Hardy introduces the noun unhope as
    the final word in the last stanza of ‘In Tenebris':

    Black is night's cope;
    But death will not appal
    One who, past doubtings all,
    Waits in unhope.

    We find very few nouns with the prefix un-; two, for example, are untruth and
    unrest. Hopkin's unfathering, and Hardy's unhope remain nonce-words (words coined
    for a single occasion); they have not entered the vocabulary stock of the language.

    Conversion is a common process for the formation of new words. We butter bread, take a /ook, calm somebody. In these everyday examples, words have changed from their original word-class to a new word-class without any change in their form: Butter is a verb derived from a noun (‘put butter on'), /ook is a noun derived from a verb, and calm is a verb derived from an adjective. Poets sometimes introduce nonce-formations through conversion. Hopkins converts the adjective comfortless into a noun in ‘grouping round my comfortless' and the abstract non-count noun comfort into a concrete count noun in ‘Here! creep, Wretch, under a comfort'. e.e. cummings takes conversion to an extreme by converting the past form did and its negative didn't into nouns in ‘he sang his didn't he danced his did'.

    Sometimes the poet's lexical innovations are compounds, the combination of two words into one: Hopkin's self/yeast in ‘selfyeast of spirit a dull dough sours'; English in Use 229

    T.S. Eliot's sea-girls; thought-fox in the title of a poem by Ted Hughes; and gifi-strong in John Berryman's ‘when he was young and gifi-strong'.

    Poets often introduce unusual collocations of words, which may require figurative interpretations. Examples abound. Here are just a few:

    The child's cry / Melts in the wall. (Sylvia Plath)

    Bitter memory like vomit / Choked my throat. (Gary Snyder)
    Your /ips are animals (Anne Sexton)

    This grandson of fishes (Robert Bly)

    across the castrate lawn (Richard Wilbur)

    hopeless cathedrals (Allen Ginsberg)

    Some deviations are grammatical. Departures from normal word order are common in poetry. In the following line from Walt Whitman the direct object Vigil strange is fronted, an occasional unusual order in non-poetic language (cf. 9.3).

    Vigil strange I kept on the field one night

    Also abnormal is the order vigil strange rather than strange vigil, since adjectives generally come before the nouns they modify. In the next example from W.H. Auden, the direct object A white perfection is abnormally placed between the subject Swans in the winter and the verb have:

    Swans in the winter air
    A white perfection have

    In another example, from Wallace Stevens, the phrase upon a hill is extracted from the first of a pair of coordinated clauses (J placed a jar in Tennessee upon a hill) and placed after the second clause:

    I placed a jar in Tennessee
    And round it was, upon a hill.

    In addition, the subject complement round is fronted from its normal position (it was round). Finally, in these lines from a sonnet by Gerard Manley Hopkins, the verb find is abnormally omitted in the first of two coordinated clauses:

    The sense is ‘than blind eyes can find day in their dark?'
    230 An Introduction to English Grammar

    Excessive regularities are expressed in the systematic organization of features that otherwise occur unsystematically in the language. Poetry is often marked by patterns of sound; for example, metre, rhyme, and alliteration. The alliteration of / in this stanza from Philip Larkin's poem ‘Toads' is so abundant that it could not occur by chance in the ordinary use of language:

    Lots of folk live on their wits:
    Lecturers, lispers,

    Losels, loblolly-men, louts —
    They don't end as paupers.

    The alternate lines end with identical sounds: ¢s in wits and /outs, and pers in lispers and paupers.

    Another type of patterning is parallelism. Parallel structures exhibit grammatical, lexical, and semantic similarities. Here is an example of close parallelism from ‘Little Gidding' in T.S. Eliot's ‘Four Quartets':

    We die with the dying:

    See, they depart, and we go with them.
    We are born with the dead:

    See, they return, and bring us with them.

    In the next example, from the end of one of John Donne's sonnets, the final two
    lines are parallel. This parallelism takes the form of chiasmus, a reversal of the
    order of the two parts of the parallel structures: the except-clause comes first in one
    line, and second in the other line.

    Take me to you, imprison me, for I,
    Except you enthrall me, never shall be free,
    Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me.

    The two clauses in the first line are also parallel. Grammatically, both clauses are
    imperative, starting with an imperative verb followed by a direct object. Lexically,
    both clauses have the same pronoun me as direct object, and the verbs take (in this
    structure) and imprison are partial synonyms. Semantically, both clauses express
    the poet's request to God (the subject that is understood from the previous con-
    text) to take control of him.

    One useful approach to literary analysis is to start by looking for the language
    features that deviate from what we know to be normal in language. This approach
    is explored in the following section.

    10.6.1 Foregrounding

    Literary language, especially poetic language, is distinguished by the consistency
    with which it uses foregrounding. The term foregrounding is a visual metaphor; it
    refers to the language features that stand out from the background of normal
    use. One of the objectives that analysts of the language of literature may set for
    themselves is to find interpretations of foregrounding. As in all literary criticism,
    there is scope for more than one interpretation, but some interpretations are more
    plausible than others.

    I take as my first example a poem by Thomas Hardy, entitled ‘In Tenebris' (‘In
    Darkness'). It has a Latin epigraph from Psalm 102, which is rendered in the King
    James version ‘My heart is smitten, and withered like grass'. The complete poem
    follows:

    Wintertime nighs;
    But my bereavement-pain
    It cannot bring again:

    Twice no one dies.

    5 Flower-petals flee;
    But, since it once hath been,
    No more that severing scene
    Can harrow me.

    Birds faint in dread:
    10 I shall not lose old strength
    In the lone frost's black length:
    Strength long since fled!

    Leaves freeze to dun;
    But friends can not turn cold
    15 This season as of old
    For him with none.

    Tempests may scath;
    But love can not make smart
    Again this year his heart
    20 Who no heart hath.

    Black is night's cope;
    But death will not appal
    One who, past doubtings all,
    Waits in unhope.

    The poem is divided into six stanzas. The stanza division is made more con-
    spicuous than usual by the indentation of the first and last lines, which are shorter
    than the middle lines. Sound patterning reinforces the feeling that each stanza is a
    unit: the two shorter lines rhyme and the two longer lines rhyme, and no rhymes
    are repeated across stanzas. The metrical scheme is iambic (unstressed syllable
    followed by stressed syllable), but contrary to the iambic norm every stanza begins
    with a stressed syllable.

    The parallelism in appearance and sound has its analogy in a parallelism in
    sense. The stanzas elaborate the comparison expressed in the epigram from the
    Psalms: a comparison between desolation in nature and desolation in personal
    feelings. The first line of each stanza portrays a negative image from nature, an
    image that conjures up loss or danger. The next three lines relate this image to a
    negative human experience.

    Negation is foregrounded in the poem, which is replete with negative words
    (no one, no more, none, not, no) and words with negative connotations (such as
    wintertime, bereavement-pain, flee, lose, black, death). The final word is the nonce-
    formation unhope, which we examined in the previous section. It makes a stronger
    impact than a possible synonym such as despair might have. As the negative of
    hope, it intimates the absence of any feeling of hope: a state beyond hope. The
    contrast with hope is underlined by the collocation Wazts in unhope, which brings to
    mind the normal collocation mazts in hope. In its strategic position as the final word
    of the poem, unhope is the climax to a series of preceding negative expressions.

    The negation motif chimes with the imagery and themes of the poem. In each stanza the comments that follow the nature imagery allude to previous experiences of pain and despair. The consequences of past adversities have been permanent, so that a repetition of the adversity can no longer affect the poet. The final stanza refers to the ultimate adversity — death. But even death 'will not appal'.

    In the first half of the poem, the poet treats the experiences as personal to him by using the first person pronouns I, me, my. In the second half, his pain and despair are distanced through the use of the third person pronouns he and his and (in the final stanza) the indefinite pronoun one. Through the change in pronouns, the poet generalizes from his own experiences to the human condition.

    My final example of foregrounding involves departures from both external and internal norms. The poem, given in full below, is by Gerard Manley Hopkins. It is titled 'Heaven-Haven' and subtitled 'A nun takes the veil'. The subtitle provides the situational context for the poem. The title not only points to the theme of the poem (heaven as haven), but also introduces the linguistic device that dominates the poem, close parallelism. The two words heaven and haven fall short of complete identity by just one vowel sound as well as one letter:

    I have desired to go
    Where springs not fail,

    To fields where flies no sharp and sided hail
    And a few lilies blow.

    And I have asked to be
    Where no storms come,
    Where the green swell is in the havens dumb,

    And out of the swing of the sea.

    The close parallelism in grammatical structure between the two stanzas calls attention to itself. The last three lines in each stanza refer to places that are characterized by the negatives not and no and by words that have negative connotations.

    The closeness of the parallelism also foregrounds the differences between the two stanzas. The first stanza opens with "I have desired to go" and the second stanza with "I have asked to be." Desire is ambiguous between two meanings: the stative 'wanted' and the dynamic 'asked' (cf. 3.14). In the 'asked' interpretation, the line is closer in meaning to the opening line of the second stanza. Both lines then describe a past request. The present perfect 'have desired' and 'have asked' indicate that the request is relevant to the present time of the poem, whereas the simple past 'I desired' and 'I asked' might suggest that the person is no longer interested in having the request granted. On the other hand, in the 'wanted' interpretation, 'I have desired' points to a feeling that has extended over a period of time to the present but has not necessarily been translated into the action of making a request. The ambiguity is mimetic of ambivalence. The ostensible speaker is a woman about to become a nun, and she expresses some feeling of ambivalence about taking the veil. The change from the ambiguous 'desired' to the unambiguous 'asked' suggests a progression in the poem.

    Similarly the switch from 'desired to go' to 'asked to be' marks a progression: the dynamic 'go' points to a striving, whereas the stative 'be' indicates a state of rest. There are other differences between the stanzas that suggest a similar advance. There is more deviation from grammatical norms in the first stanza, perhaps mimetic of the striving: the archaic negation without do in 'springs not fail' (instead of 'springs do not fail'), the fronting of the verb in 'fles no sharp and sided hail', and the separation of the two parts of the compound in 'sharp and sided hail' (instead of 'sharp-sided hail').

    There is a difference between where the speaker has desired to go and where she
    has asked to be. The first stanza describes a countryside with springs and fields. It
    alludes to material needs (springs not fail) and pleasures (a few lilies blow). The
    second stanza describes a place of peace and quiet, the haven of the poem's title.
    The tension in the first stanza — conveyed in large part by the grammar — is
    resolved in the final stanza. The first stanza indicates a desire for positive things,
    even though negatives are used: springs that do not fail, fields without hail, and the
    presence of a few lilies. The second stanza calls for the absence of storms and tides:
    the ideal is the absence of conflict.

    In the next section we will explore the type of foregrounding that derives from
    ambiguity.

    10.6.2 Ambiguity

    In the everyday uses of the spoken language and in most writing, ambiguity is a
    fault to be avoided because it may cause confusion or misunderstanding. Poets,
    however, introduce ambiguity intentionally to convey simultaneous meanings.
    Puns, which are based on multiple interpretations, are employed playfully in
    poetry as in jokes and advertisements, though they may also have a serious pur-
    pose. The following stanza, from a poem by John Donne, contains two puns, one
    on Sun and the other on done:

    I have a sin of fear, that when I have spun
    My last thread, I shall perish on the shore;
    Swear by thyself, that at my death thy Sun
    Shall shine as it shines now, and heretofore:
    And, having done that, thou hast done,
    I have no more.

    Religious poetry traditionally puns Sun with Son, Christ the son of God, blending
    the associations of natural light with the associations of spiritual light. The second
    pun is personal, on the name of the poet: thou hast done combines the meaning ‘you
    have finished' with ‘you have Donne'. The last two lines of the poem echo a refrain
    in the previous stanzas:

    When thou hast done, thou hast not done,
    For I have more.

    The poet tells God that when He has forgiven the sins he enumerates He has not
    finished because he has more sins. At the same time, the pun conveys the added
    meaning that God has not taken possession of Donne because he has more sins. It
    is through Christ that at his death the poet will be fully forgiven by God and taken
    by God.

    Grammatical ambiguities are also found in poetry. They are generally more
    difficult to analyse than lexical ambiguities. The first example comes from T.S.
    Eliot's The Waste Land, in an extract from the section called "The Fire Sermon':

    At the violet hour, when the eyes and back

    Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits
    Like a taxi throbbing waiting,

    breasts. This seems at first reading to be in apposition with two lives: one life is an
    old man, the other perhaps a woman with wrinkled female breasts. But the absence
    of a description of a second life suggests that the reader has been sent on a false
    trail. The phrase is then re-assigned as appositive to the subject of the sentence. J
    Tiresias. We have two grammatical analyses of the function of the appositive; the
    second supersedes the first, but the effect of the first lingers. Tiresias is the old
    man with wrinkled female breasts and the throbbing between two lives is the
    uneasy straddling of male and female in Tiresias. The grammatical straddling
    between two analyses reinforces the imagery. A second false trail is set by what
    follows the verb can see (line 5). Is see here intransitive ("Tiresias has the ability to
    see'), or is it transitive ("Tiresias can see somebody or something')? If it is transi-
    tive, we expect a direct object to follow later in the sentence. The reader is kept in
    suspense for several lines. The phrase beginning with the evening hour is in apposition
    with the violet hour (line 6). The evening hour is modified by a relative clause whose
    predicates are coordinated: that strives / Homeward, and brings the sailor home from
    sea. It looks as if what follows shares the verb brings and is coordinated, though the
    coordinator and is implied and not present; brings the sailor home from sea, / The
    typist home at teatime. The parallelism of the sailor home and The typist home and the
    commas after sea and teatime encourage that initial reading. Yet as we read on, we
    see that The typist has its own set of coordinated predicates: clears her breakfast, lights
    / Her stove, and lays out food in tins (lines 8-9). The typist could therefore be the
    subject of a new sentence. Alternatively, The typist home at teatime might indeed be
    coordinated with the sailor home from sea, and the predicates that follow might be a
    relative clause (cf. 4.5) with the relative pronoun who omitted, though the omission

     would be very odd in the ordinary use of language: brings... / The typist home at
    teatime, [who] clears / her breakfast, hghts / Her stove, and lays out food in tins.
    Let us now turn back to the question whether see in line 5 is intransitive or
    transitive. The question is in fact not resolved, since the grammatical status of see
    depends on the interpretation of The typist home at teatime (line 8). If this phrase
    begins a new sentence, see is intransitive. If it is coordinated with the sailor home
    from sea (line 7), see is still intransitive. But there is yet a third possibility. The
    phrase may be the subject of a that-clause (whose conjunction that is omitted)
    which functions as direct object of a transitive see: J Tiresias... can see / At the
    violet hour... [that] / The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights / Her
    stove, and lays out food in tins. This interpretation, which is discouraged by the
    comma after fealime, is given some support by a parallel sentence five lines later:

    I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs
    Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest —
    I too awaited the expected guest.

    Yet the analysis of these lines is also not straightforward. The sentence is
    parallel if Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest is the predicate of the sentence
    236 An Introduction to English Grammar

    (I Tirestas.../ Perceived ...). But the absence of a comma after dugs allows the
    possibility that the line is a relative clause with omitted who (I Tiresias ... [who] /
    Perceived...).

    We have seen that the phrase The typist home at teatime faces both ways and that
    as a result there are three possible interpretations of lines 8—9 that depend on three
    grammatical analyses. The grammatical ambiguities mimic the paradox of Tiresias,
    a man who has wrinkled female breasts and a blind man who can see.

    The next example of ambiguity comes from the first four lines of a sonnet by
    Gerard Manley Hopkins. In these lines, the poet calls on himself to turn away
    from a cycle of self-accusations with which he is tormenting himself:

    My own heart let me more have pity on; let
    Me live to my sad self hereafter kind,
    Charitable; not live this tormented mind

    BW he

    With this tormented mind tormenting yet.

    Line | starts with the fronted "My own heart", the complement of the preposition on
    (cf. 4.25). Later in the line occurs the unusual positioning of "more". The oddity of
    the position of "more" foregrounds the word and is the cause of its grammatical
    ambiguity. "More" may be an adverb (‘more often') or an adjective modifying pity.
    As an adverb, it should come at the end and be accompanied by some time
    expression such as now or than before: ‘Let me have pity on my heart more than
    before'. As an adjective, it should precede pity: ‘Let me have more pity on my
    heart'. The basis of comparison for the adjective is left vague, but two possibilities
    suggest themselves: ‘Let me have more pity on myself than on others' or Let me
    have more pity on myself than I have had before'. The second possibility is closer
    to the interpretation indicated if "more" is an adverb, and it receives support from the
    word hereafter in the parallel sentence that follows.

    "Live" in line 2 seems to be treated as a linking verb, with the adjectives kind, /
    Charitable as subject complement (cf. 3.8). In normal use, /ve is an intransitive or
    a transitive verb, so we would ordinarily expect it to occur with adverbs rather
    than adjectives (They lived happily ever after, not They lived happy ever after). The
    grammatical deviation is highlighted by the postponement of the adjectives to the
    end instead of the normal order as in ‘Let me live hereafter kind, charitable to my
    sad self. The unusual structure with a subject complement contributes to the
    ambiguities of the parallel contrasting sentence in lines 3—4.

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Ambiguity in the Phrase ''Let me have more pity on my heart''\n\nAnalyze the grammatical ambiguity in the phrase ''Let me have more pity on my heart'' from the text.\n- **Part A**: Identify whether ''more'' is functioning as an adverb or an adjective, and explain why this creates ambiguity.\n- **Part B**: Propose two alternative interpretations of the phrase based on these possibilities, justifying which interpretation is more likely given the context of the sonnet.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the placement of ''more'' and the structure of the sentence contribute to the poetic effect described in the text, considering the role of grammatical deviation in creating ambiguity.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of grammatical roles and the impact of structural deviations on meaning, as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'The Role of ''Live'' as a Linking Verb\n\nExamine the use of ''live'' in line 2 of the sonnet: ''Let me live to my sad self hereafter kind, charitable''.\n- **Part A**: Explain why ''live'' is treated as a linking verb in this context, and contrast this with its normal usage as an intransitive or transitive verb.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the grammatical deviation in the sentence structure, including the placement of adjectives ''kind'' and ''charitable'', and discuss how this deviation contributes to the ambiguity with the parallel sentence in lines 3—4.\n- **Part C**: Consider how the grammatical structure of this sentence reflects the poet''s intent to create a contrast between the normal usage of ''live'' and its unconventional placement in the sonnet.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate an understanding of linking verbs and grammatical deviations as discussed in the text.'

    The ambiguities lie in the grammatical function of this tormented mind. According to one interpretation the phrase is a subject complement, parallel to kind, / Charit-able, and then Jet me is implied from the preceding sentence: Jet / Me live to my sad self hereafter kind, / Charitable; [let me] not live this tormented mind / With this tormented mind tormenting yet. If we use be as the linking verb, a simple example of this structure might be Let me be kind to myself, not be a tormentor. As in the preceding sentence, it is odd to have /ive as a linking verb.

    English in Use 237

    In a second interpretation, ¢/is tormented mind is the subject of the intransitive verb /ive and is parallel to me in the preceding sentence; only /et is carried over. The grammatical oddity in this interpretation is that the subject is placed after the verb. If we repositioned the subject in the normal order, we would have //et/ this tormented mind not live with this tormented mind tormenting yet.

    In the third interpretation, tis tormented mind is the direct object of the transi-
    tive verb Jive, and /et me is implied from the preceding context. The first part of
    the sentence might be rephrased ‘Let me not live this tormented mind'. But as a
    transitive verb, /ive is highly restricted in the direct objects it may take. We would
    normally expect a noun phrase with /ife as its main word (‘Let me not live this
    tormented life'), as in the expressions [ive a hard life, live a good hfe.

    The verb torment is ordinarily a transitive verb, but no direct object follows it in
    line 4. One interpretation is that thzs tormented mind is the object implied from line
    3: With this tormented mind tormenting [this tormented mind] yet. The effect is to
    suggest an endless cycle of tormentor and tormented, with the poet as a self-
    tormentor. Alternatively, torment is exceptionally here intransitive, and the sense is
    "This tormented mind is still experiencing torment'. Compare My leg is hurting.

    All the interpretations that I have offered for these four lines co-exist and, in
    doing so, enrich the poem. The dislocations in grammar mimic the psychological
    dislocations that the poet describes.

    The final example comes from the first eight lines of a sonnet by John Milton.
    The context of the sonnet is the onset of blindness in Milton and his reaction to his
    disability.

    When I consider how my light is spent,
    Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,
    And that one Talent which is death to hide
    Lodged with me useless, though my Soul more bent

    My true account, lest he returning chide,
    Doth God exact day labour, light denied,
    I fondly ask;...

    Con ON Se WH NY

    There are various places where multiple interpretations are possible, but I will
    focus on the last three lines of the octet. In lines 4—6 Milton asserts his eagerness to
    present God with a ‘true account' of his life, lest he returning chide (‘lest God when
    He returns — or when He replies — rebukes me'). On an initial reading the question
    in line 7 seems to be asked by God: Doth God exact day labour, light denied (‘Does
    God require casual labour when light is denied?'). The question then appears to be
    a rhetorical question that God asks in rebuking the poet, and as a rhetorical
    question it seeks no answer (cf. 6.2). It implies the strong assertion that of course
    God does not exact day labour when light is denied. However, when the reader
    reaches line 8, it becomes transparent that the fronting of the question before the

    The reporting clause has laid a false trail. The question is not asked by God, but by the poet: I fondly ask (‘I foolishly ask'). The question now emerges as a genuine yes—no question, which the poet immediately evaluates as a foolish question. The folly of the question is underlined by the previous reading of it as a rhetorical question, which makes the question unnecessary. Because God's assertion of His justice is replaced by the poet's questioning of God's justice, the poet's question is seen to be insolent and presumptuous. The effect is obtained through the succession of two analyses of the grammar of lines 6—7: the initial misinterpretation is immediately followed by an accurate second interpretation. The poet's foolish question is answered in the final line of the sonnet:

    They also serve who only stand and wait.

    Exercise 10.7 Email English (cf. 10.5)

    The following is an intercalated email exchange between friends. Discuss the
    features that distinguish it as a typical example of email communication.

    Hi J.

    Good to hear from you. I was in London in June, and tried to look you
    up, but you had obviously already moved. Where are you now?

    >oh shit! What a shame...

    >I sent you a mail back in March, I think, to a hotmail account but don't
    >know if you got that. Old job closed down in January with everyone out
    >of a job like that with no pay. I now work for another web company.
    >Am living in Brick Lane, which is very fine.

    I recently had a visit from Ken. He stayed with me a few days, with his
    new fiancee, on their way to London, and again on the way back. We had
    several good drinking sessions here — just like old times, eh?

    >So wish I could have been there...I spoke to Ken when he was in
    >London and we were going to meet up but he had to cancel due to the
    >pain he was in with his slipped disk... . Where is Ken now and what's
    >he up to?

    Exercise 10.8 Email English (cf. 10.5)

    Below are two emails written by colleagues. The second email is a reply to the first.
    Discuss the features of the exchange that relate to written communication, and
    those that it has in common with speech.

    Dear Alan,

    Appendix: Spelling

    A.l Spelling, pronunciation, and meaning

    English spelling is difficult because the pronunciation of a word is not always an
    accurate guide to its spelling. Two reasons account for most of the discrepancy
    between pronunciation and spelling.

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Ambiguity in Word Class Assignment**\n\nIn the line ''Bitter would have me taste; my taste was me,'' consider the possible interpretations of ''bitter'' as either a direct object or a subject complement.\n- **Part A**: Explain the grammatical function of ''bitter'' in each interpretation, citing specific grammatical rules from the text.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the effect of this ambiguity on the overall meaning and tone of the stanza. How does it allow for multiple interpretations of the speaker''s emotional state?\n- **Part C**: Compare this ambiguity to a similar example in the text. How does the structure of the sentences in the text help clarify or complicate such ambiguities?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference grammatical concepts from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how word class ambiguity affects meaning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Punctuation and Meaning in Poetry**\n\nAnalyze the punctuation in the stanza: ''To dispense, with justice; or, to dispense\nwith justice. Thus the catholic god of France,...''\n- **Part A**: Explain how the punctuation marks (commas, semicolons, and periods) influence the reader''s interpretation of the speaker''s intent.\n- **Part B**: Consider the effect of the line breaks between ''To dispense, with justice;'' and ''Thus the catholic god of France,...'' on the poem''s structure. How might this punctuation create a contrast between the two parts of the stanza?\n- **Part C**: Compare this punctuation to a similar example in the text. How does the use of punctuation help convey meaning that is not immediately clear from the words alone?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must link punctuation choices to specific effects on meaning and structure, using examples from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Characteristics of English in Spoken and Written Contexts**\n\nBased on the text''s discussion of spelling, pronunciation, and meaning, analyze a sample from one of the sources listed (e.g., a political speech or song lyrics).\n- **Part A**: Discuss the relationship between spelling and pronunciation in your chosen sample. Do the spellings align with the expected pronunciations?\n- **Part B**: Examine how the context (spoken vs. written) affects the interpretation of the sample. How might a listener interpret a word differently than a reader?\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the role of spelling in conveying meaning, using examples from your analysis. How does the text''s discussion support or challenge your conclusions?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of spelling, pronunciation, and context, and demonstrate an understanding of how these factors interact in different forms of English.'

    One reason is that our spelling system is essentially a mixture of two systems:
    the system used in England before the Norman Conquest in 1066 was mixed with
    a new system introduced by the Norman-French scribes. We therefore find two
    spellings for the same sound (as in the final sound of mouse and mice) or two sounds
    for the same spelling (as in the first sound of get and gem). Later borrowings of
    words from foreign languages — particularly from French, Latin, and Greek —
    brought additional spellings; you will recognize as unusual such spellings as the ch
    of chorus, the ph of philosophy, the g of genre, the oz of reservoir, and the oup of coup.
    Some spellings were changed to bring words nearer to the form they had in other
    languages, and the changes introduced letters that have never been pronounced in
    English. One example is the 'g' in debt: the 'b' was present in the Latin word from
    which the French equivalent came, but English borrowed the word from French
    when French no longer had a 'g'. Other examples of such changes are the 'd' in doubt,
    the 'k' in salmon, and the 'p' in receipt.

    The second reason for the discrepancy between pronunciation and spelling is
    that spellings have generally remained fixed while pronunciations have changed.
    During the Middle Ages the few who could write might spell the same word in
    more than one way; they did not think that only one spelling was correct. When
    the first printers introduced printing in English in the late fifteenth century they
    began to establish stable spellings. However, during that century important sound
    changes took place in English vowels. Those changes and later sound changes are
    generally not reflected in our spellings. In the centuries that followed, printers
    continued to work toward a uniform and stable system of spelling, and then the
    major dictionaries of the eighteenth century established a standard spelling that is
    close to our present system. On the whole, printers and dictionaries have been a
    conservative force, preserving old spellings when sounds have changed. We there-
    fore find spellings like the 'gh' of night and the 'k' of know, which retain letters for
    sounds that we no longer make. Or we find different spellings for the same sound,

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Spelling and Pronunciation Discrepancies**\n\nExplain the historical reasons for the discrepancy between English spelling and pronunciation, using the information provided in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two key historical events that contributed to this discrepancy and describe their impact.\n- **Step 2**: Provide an example of a word that illustrates the discrepancy and explain how it reflects both spelling and pronunciation changes.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the text emphasizes the conservative role of printers and dictionaries in preserving old spellings despite pronunciation changes.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must tie together historical events and linguistic principles to explain the inconsistencies between spelling and pronunciation in English, with specific examples from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Spelling Changes and Phonetic Influence**\n\nDiscuss the reasons why certain letters are retained in English spelling even though they no longer correspond to their original sounds. Use the examples given in the text (e.g., ''gh'' in night, ''k'' in know) and explain how these retain the influence of older spellings.\n- **Part A**: Describe the process by which English spelling has remained stable while pronunciation has changed.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the role of foreign language borrowings in introducing new spellings, using examples like ''ch'' in chorus and ''ph'' in philosophy.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the text''s discussion of spelling changes reflects a broader linguistic principle about language evolution.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the text''s examples and demonstrate an understanding of how spelling systems adapt to pronunciation changes over time.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Spelling and Sound Changes**\n\nThe text describes how English spellings have remained fixed while pronunciations have changed. Consider the word ''receipt'' (spelled with a ''p'') and its historical development.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the letter ''p'' was added to spelling despite it not being pronounced in English.\n- **Part B**: Construct a counterexample to the claim that ''all letters in English spelling have been pronounced at some point.'' Your example must reference a specific word and its historical development, as described in the text.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the claim that ''spelling changes are more likely to occur than pronunciation changes in English.'' Use logical reasoning based on the text''s explanation of printers and dictionaries preserving old spellings.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the historical and linguistic factors influencing English spelling, with specific references to examples from the text.'

- prompt: "Such as \"ea\" in meat and \"ee\" in need, because at one time those combinations represented different sounds. Or the sound changed differently in different words, so that the same spelling represents for us two different sounds, such as \"oo\" in book and flood.\n\nTo some extent our spellings take account of meaning. Sometimes we lose in the spelling-sound relationship but gain in the spelling-meaning relationship. In the first place, we often distinguish homophones (different words pronounced in the same way) by spelling them differently. Here are a few common homophones that we distinguish through spelling:\n\nson — sun  \npeace — piece  \nsent — cent — scent  \nright — write\n\nSecondly, we often use a similar spelling for parts of words that are related in meaning even though we pronounce them differently. The -ed inflection, for example, has the same grammatical functions in \"published\" and \"revolted\", but the inflection is pronounced in two different ways. The spelling may also show that some sets of words are related where the pronunciation obscures the relationship. For example, we spell the first two syllables of \"nation\" and \"national\" identically, but the first vowel is pronounced differently in the two words. Similarly, the first three vowels of \"photography\" are different from the vowels of \"photograph\", but our spelling connects the two words. We pronounce the words in these sets differently because we shorten vowels that are stressed weakly or not at all. Usually the unstressed or weakly stressed vowel is pronounced like the second vowel of \"nation\". Some common one-syllable words we pronounce in more than one way; in the rapid pace of normal conversation we do not stress them and therefore we shorten their vowels. For that reason we have at least two pronunciations of words like \"can\", \"does\", and \"your\". Sometimes we go further and drop the vowel completely; when we are not writing formally, we can then show the omission by contractions of some words, such as 'm' for \"am\", 's' for \"is\" or \"has\", and \"'I/\" for \"will\".\n\nThe text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Homophones and Spelling Conventions**\n\nExplain how the text''s discussion of homophones (e.g., ''son'' and ''sun'') and spelling conventions (e.g., the -ed inflection in ''published'' and ''revolted'') helps us distinguish words that are pronounced the same but have different meanings.\n- **Step 1**: Define what homophones are and how spelling is used to differentiate them.\n- **Step 2**: Discuss the role of the -ed inflection in showing grammatical relationships despite different pronunciations.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an original example of a homophone pair that is distinguished by spelling and explain how the text''s principles apply to it.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both homophones and spelling conventions as outlined in the text, with a clear example that illustrates the concept.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Spelling and Pronunciation Relationships**\n\nConsider the words ''nation'' and ''national''. According to the text, they share the same spelling for the first two syllables but are pronounced differently.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the text suggests that the difference in pronunciation is due to ''shortening vowels that are stressed weakly or not at all''.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how this phenomenon affects the spelling-meaning relationship in English. Use the example of ''can'' and ''does'' to illustrate your point.\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence that demonstrates the ''shortening of vowels in unstressed syllables'' as described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts of vowel shortening and its impact on spelling-meaning relationships, with a clear example from the text.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Reasoning about Spelling Conventions and Contractions**\n\nThe text mentions that in informal speech, we often drop vowels completely, as seen in contractions like ''m'' for ''am'', ''s'' for ''is'' or ''has'', and ''I/'' for ''will''.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the text''s explanation of vowel omission relates to the concept of ''shortening vowels that are stressed weakly or not at all''.\n- **Part B**: Create a contraction for the phrase ''I am'' that follows the pattern described in the text. Justify your choice using the text''s principles.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the trade-off between spelling-sound relationship and spelling-meaning relationship in English. Use the example of ''can'' having two pronunciations to support your argument.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of vowel omission and its implications for both spelling-sound and spelling-meaning relationships in English.'

- prompt: "A final advantage of the relationship between spelling and meaning is that one  \nspelling of a word may represent different pronunciations, but the spelling shows  \nthat it is the same word. English is an international language that is spoken  \ndifferently in different countries. Even within England we do not find a uniform  \npronunciation; the pronunciation of a word may vary from one area to another or  \nbetween groups within the same area. For example, some say roof with a long u  \nsound, others with a short u sound; some pronounce the final 7 in words like car,  \nothers do not; some pronounce the vowel in cup like that in /uck, others like that in  \nput. Those spellings give some indication of pronunciation, but if we spelled words  \nexactly as we pronounced them, people with different pronunciations of a word  \nwould spell the word in different ways. Our spelling usually indicates a shared  \nmeaning; it does not necessarily represent an identical pronunciation.  \n248 An Introduction to English Grammar  \n\nA.2 Spelling variants  \n\nEnglish spelling, like English punctuation, is a convention that is helpful to the  \nreader. Spelling mistakes distract and irritate readers. Good spelling is usually  \nconsidered a sign that the writer is educated.  \n\nThe spelling of the vast majority of words is now fixed. However, you will  \nencounter some variant spellings in your reading or in dictionaries. For example,  \nyou may find realise and realize, archaeology and archeology, judgment and judge-  \nment, adviser and advisor. Do not use more than one spelling in a piece of writing,  \nsince inconsistencies are distracting. If you are used to a recognized and acceptable  \nvariant, keep to it. If not, select a dictionary and follow its spellings consistently.  \nConsult the introduction to your dictionary to find out if it signals the preferred  \nspelling when there are variants.  \n\nSome spelling variants are exclusively British or are more common in British  \nwriting. For example, British spelling uses the -ise and -isation endings (civilise,  \ncivilisation) as well as the -7ze and -ization endings that are normal for American  \nspelling (civilize, civilization). Here are some common American spellings and the  \nusual British spellings for the same word:\n\nThe text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Spelling Variants in English**\n\nCompare the spelling variants of ''realise'' and ''realize'', and ''archaeology'' and ''archeology''. Using the text, explain how these variants reflect differences in British and American English.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the spelling conventions associated with each variant (e.g., British vs. American).\n- **Step 2**: Justify why these spelling differences exist despite the same meaning.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss how using inconsistent spellings in writing can confuse readers, as mentioned in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly differentiate between British and American spellings for these words and explain the implications of spelling consistency in writing.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Spelling Rules and Conventions**\n\nConstruct a sentence that correctly uses the British spelling ''realise'' and the American spelling ''realize''. Explain how this sentence demonstrates proper spelling conventions as outlined in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Choose a context where both spellings are appropriate (e.g., academic or informal writing).\n- **Step 2**: Write the sentence, ensuring only one spelling is used.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your choice based on the text''s advice about using consistent spellings in a single piece of writing.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must reflect the text''s emphasis on maintaining spelling consistency and avoiding confusion.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Spelling and Pronunciation**\n\nThe text states that spelling often indicates shared meaning, not identical pronunciation. Consider the word ''colonel''.\n- **Part A**: Explain why ''colonel'' is spelled with two ''l''s in British English and one ''l'' in American English.\n- **Part B**: Create a counterexample to the claim that ''spelling indicates an exact pronunciation''.

    A.3 Spelling rules for short and long vowel sounds
    1. doubling of consonant after short vowel

    The vowels a, e, i, o, u have both long and short pronunciations; for example, the
    vowel a has a long pronunciation in rate and a short pronunciation in rat. The
    following general rule applies if the vowel is stressed.

    Appendix: Spelling 249
    Generally, a long vowel is followed by a single consonant plus a vowel:
    V+CH+Y: long vowel + consonant + vowel

    and a short vowel is followed by a double consonant; at the end of the word, a
    short vowel can be followed by just a single consonant:

    V+C+C: short vowel + consonant + consonant

    V+C: short vowel + consonant (end of word).
    Examples:

    Long vowel Short vowel

    middle end

    V+C+yv V+C+C V+C V+C+C

    tape, taping matter, tapping tap camp

    scene, scenic message, begging beg sell

    ripe, ripen blizzard, shipping ship miss

    hope, hopeful bottom, hopping hop fond

    amuse, amusement suffer, cutting cut much

    The rule is particularly useful when you add a suffix or inflectional ending to a

    word (cf. A.4 (1)).

    2. addition of final -e to indicate long vowel

    A final silent -e is used to indicate that the preceding stressed vowel is long:

    Long vowel Short vowel
    V+Crte V+C
    mate, debate mat

    theme, extreme them

    fine, polite fin

    robe, explode rob

    cute, amuse cut

    Here are some common exceptions, where the preceding vowel does not have the
    regular pronunciation:

    have; there, where; were; come, done, love, none, one, some; lose, move,
    prove, whose; gone; give, live (verb)

    A.4 Suffixes

    A suffix is an ending added to a word that produces another word; for example, the
    suffix ful is added to help to produce helpful. An inflection is a type of suffix that is
    added to the end of a word to produce another form of the same word; for
    example, we add -s to the noun Jook to produce the plural books, and we add -ed to
    the verb walk to produce the past walked. The general rules for suffixes in (1)—(3)
    below apply also to inflections, and the examples include words with inflections
    added to them.

    1. doubling of consonant before suffix

    We often double a final consonant when we add a suffix beginning with a vowel.
    Double the final consonant before a suffix beginning with a vowel:

    1. if the word ends in a single consonant, and
    2. if a single vowel comes before the consonant, and
    3. if the syllable before the suffix is stressed.

    Condition (3) always applies if the suffix is added to a monosyllabic word.

    suffix added to monosyllabic word Polysyllabic word: suffix follows

    stop +ed — stopped stressed syllable

    swim + ing — swimming permit + ed — permitted
    big+er — bigger prefer +ed — preferred
    red+ish — reddish forget + ing — forgetting
    drug + ist — druggist begin + ing — beginning
    win+er  — winner occur + ence — occurrence

    The vowel before the consonant is a short vowel (cf. A.3).

    In the following sets of related words, the final consonant is doubled when the
    suffix follows a stressed syllable, but not when it follows an unstressed syllable.
    The contrasts illustrate the stress rule:

    suffix follows stressed syllable suffix follows unstressed syllable

    deferred, deferring deference
    inferred, inferring inference
    preferred, preferring preference

    referred, referring reference

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.

'

- prompt: |-
    A few polysyllabic words ending in -s have irregular variants with the doubling, even though the final syllable before the suffix is unstressed; for example: biased, biassed; focusing, focussing.

    Do not double the final consonant before a suffix:

    1. if the word ends in two consonants:
    finding, lifted, recorded, resistance, oldest

    2. if there are two vowels:
    meeting, rained, beaten, trainer, repeated, appearance

    3. if the stress is not on the last syllable of the word to which the suffix is added:
    limit — limiting; deliver — delivered; differ — difference

    Exceptions for words of two or more syllables:

    (a) Some words, most of them ending in /, have a double consonant even though
    the final syllable is not stressed; for example, marvellous, modelling, traveller,
    quarrelled, worshipping, handicapped, diagrammed.

    (b) Final ¢ is usually spelled ck when a suffix is added to indicate the k sound:
    mimic — mimicking; panic — panicky; picnic — picnicked; traffic — trafficked.

    2. dropping of final -e before suffix

    Drop the final silent -e before a suffix beginning with a vowel:

    have + ing — having explore + ation > exploration
    debate + ed — debated cure + able — curable
    fame + ous — famous refuse + al — refusal

    Exception where the e is kept before a vowel:

    1. Keep the e in dyeing (from dye) and singeing (from singe) to distinguish the
    words from dying (from die) and singing (from sing).

    2. Keep the e in ce and ge before a suffix beginning with a or 0 to preserve the s
    and 7 sounds: enforceable, noticeable, peaceable, traceable, advantageous, courage-
    ous, knowledgeable.

    Do not drop the e before a suffix beginning with a consonant:
    movement, forceful, hopeless, strangely
    Exceptions where the e is dropped before a consonant:

    argue — argument
    awe — awful
    due — duly

    true — truly
    whole > wholly

- prompt: |-
    When a word ends in a consonant plus y, change the y to z before any suffix except
    -ing or 's:
    happy +ly — happily study + es — studies
    amplify + er — amplifier mystery + ous — mysterious
    beauty + ful — beautiful ratify + cation — ratification
    apply +ed — applied empty + ness — emptiness

    Exceptions where the y after a consonant is kept:

    1. A few words of one syllable keep the y before a suffix: dryness, shyness, slyness.
    2. The y is kept in busyness to distinguish it from business.

    Keep the y before -ing: studying, applying
    Keep the y before 's: the spy's name, Fuly's weather
    Keep the y in most words that end in a vowel + y:

    employ + er — employer play + ful — playful
    annoy + ance — annoyance destroy + s — destroys
    spray +ed  — sprayed pay + ment — payment

    Exceptions where the y after a vowel is changed to 7: daily, laid, paid, said, slain.

    4. plurals of nouns and -s forms of
    verbs

    Similar rules apply for making the plurals of regular nouns and the -s forms of
    regular verbs. Indeed, many words can be either nouns or verbs.

    1. General rule: add -s:

    noun plurals verb -s forms

    street — streets speak — speaks
    eye — eyes bring — brings
    winter > winters write — writes

    2. If the ending is pronounced as a separate syllable (like the sound in 1s), add -es:

    noun plurals verb -s forms
    church —> churches touch — touches
    box — boxes buzz — buzzes

    bush — bushes wash — washes
    Appendix: Spelling 253

    When the word already ends in an -e, add just -s:

    noun plurals verb -s forms
    base — bases curse — curses
    judge — judges trace — traces

    3. If the word ends in a consonant plus y, change y to z and then add -es:

    noun plurals verb -s forms
    worry — worries carry — carries
    spy — spies dry — dries

    4. For some words ending in -0, add -es. Some of them have a less common
    variant in -s:

    A.6 Other aids to spelling
    1. words run together
    A common type of spelling error is to run words together by writing two words as one. Always write these phrases as separate words:

    a lot even if in fact

    all right

    no one
    even though just as of course

    In some cases the spelling depends on the meaning. For example, write nobody as one word when it is a synonym of no person, but write no body as two words in other meanings (for example, ‘no corpse'). Write anyway when it is a synonym of anyhow, but any way when it means ‘any direction' or ‘any manner'; awhile is an adverb meaning ‘for a brief period' (e.g. You can stay awhile), but a while is a noun phrase (always so when preceded by a preposition), meaning ‘a period of time' (e.g. We'll be there in a (little) while and We haven't seen them for a (long) while).

    Here are some pairs that you write either as one or as two words, depending on the meaning you intend:

    one word
    already
    altogether
    always
    anybody
    anyway
    awhile
    everyone
    everybody
    into
    maybe
    nobody
    someone

    two words
    all ready
    all together
    all ways
    any body
    any way

    a while
    every one
    every body
    in to

    may be

    no body
    some one

    Appendix: Spelling

    In most words that do not have the pronunciations as in brief, the usual order is e before 1: neighbour, weigh, reign, leisure. The most common exception is friend.

    3. -cede, -ceed, -sede

    The most common spelling is -cede:

    antecede, concede, precede, recede, secede
    We find -ceed in three words:

    exceed, proceed, succeed
    We find -sede in just one word:

    supersede

    A.7 Homophones: Words pronounced similarly

    Homophones are words that are pronounced similarly but have different meanings and spellings. Because they sound very alike, writers frequently fail to distinguish

    257

    258 An Introduction to English Grammar

    between their different spellings. In this section we disambiguate the most com-
    mon of these.
    l. accept/except
    Accept is a verb: ‘I've decided to accept his offer.'
    Except is a preposition: ‘I like all types of movies except westerns.'
    2. advice/advise

    Advice is a noun: ‘Ask your doctor for advice.'
    Advise is a verb: ‘My doctor advised me to take exercise.'

    3. affect/effect

    Affect is a verb: ‘Ozone depletion in the atmosphere affects our climate'.
    Effect is most commonly a noun: ‘What effect will the terrorist attacks have on
    air travel?'

    Effect is also sometimes used as a verb, meaning ‘to bring about (change)':
    "The migration of peoples has effected enormous social change in Europe.'

    4. choose/chose

    Both are forms of the verb choose. Choose is the base form (cf. 4.13): ‘It's
    difficult to choose from this menu.' ‘Choose your partner carefully.' Chose is the
    past tense form: ‘Last summer we chose a hotel with a sea view." The -ed form
    of the verb choose is chosen.

    5. = he's/his

    He's is a contraction of he is or he has:

    He'll tell you when he's back home. (= he is)
    I know that he's sent the cheque. (= he has)

    His is a possessive pronoun (cf. 5.19):

    Do you know Ais name?

    6. it's/its
    It's is a contraction of it is or it has:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Spelling Rules and Homophones**\n\nGiven the spelling rules for -cede, -ceed, -sede and the homophones discussed in the text, determine which spelling is correct for each of the following words:\n1. _______ (antecede/antecedent)\n2. _______ (exceed/excedent)\n3. _______ (recede/recession)\n4. _______ (supersede/supercede)\n5. _______ (concede/concession)\n\n**Task**: For each blank, select the correct spelling based on the text''s rules. Justify your answer by referencing the specific spelling rule provided (e.g., "The text states that -cede is the most common spelling...").\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must be accurate, with explicit justification for each selection based on the text''s rules.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Homophone Confusion**\n\nExplain why the homophones ''accept/except'' and ''affect/effect'' are commonly confused in writing, using the definitions provided in the text.\n- **Part A**: Compare and contrast the meanings of ''accept'' (verb) and ''except'' (preposition).\n- **Part B**: Discuss the dual meanings of ''effect'' as both a noun and a verb, and how these different uses can lead to misunderstandings.\n- **Part C**: Suggest one strategy for writers to avoid homophone errors in their work, based on the text''s examples.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly address each part of the task and clearly differentiate between the homophones as defined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Contractions and Possessives**\n\nGiven the contractions ''he''s'' and ''his'', as well as the possessive pronoun ''its'', analyze the following sentences and identify any possible ambiguities:\n1. "He''s a tall man."\n2. "It''s a beautiful day."\n3. "His car is red."\n\n**Task**: For each sentence, determine if there is a potential for ambiguity based on the text''s explanation of contractions and possessives. Explain your reasoning, referencing the definitions provided in the text (e.g., "He''s is a contraction of he is or he has...").\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly identify any ambiguities and provide a logical explanation for each, using the definitions from the text.'

    Sentences and verb phrases with transitive verbs are either active or passive. The
    active is more commonly used. The passive involves differences in the structure of
    the verb phrase: the passive verb phrase has the addition of a form of the verb be,
    which is followed by an -ed participle:

    active loves passive is loved
    will proclaim will be proclaimed
    is investigating is being investigated

    The passive sentence differs from the corresponding active sentence in that the
    active subject corresponds to the passive object:

    active The police (S) are investigating the crime (O).
    passive The crime (S) is being investigated.

    If the active subject (here The police) is retained in the passive sentence it is put
    into a by-phrase:

    The crime is being investigated by the police.

    adjective

    An adjective is a word that typically can modify a noun and usually can itself be
    modified by very; for example, (very) nice, (very) careful. Adjectives are called
    ‘attributive' when they are used as pre-modifier in a noun phrase (a conscientious
    student). They are called ‘predicative' when they are used as subject complement
    (She is conscientious) or object complement (He considers her conscientious). Adjectives that can be used both attributively and predicatively are ‘central adjectives'.

    adjective phrase

    The main word in an adjective phrase is an adjective. Other constituents that often
    appear in the phrase are pre-modifiers (which come before the adjective) and post-
    modifiers (which come after the adjective):

    quite (premod.) hungry (adj.)
    very (premod.) happy (adj.) to see you (post-mod.)

    adverb

    An adverb is a word that is used chiefly as a modifier of an adjective (extremely in
    extremely pale), or a modifier of another adverb (very in very suddenly), or as an
    adverbial (frequently in I visit my family frequently).

    adverb phrase

    The main word in an adverb phrase is an adverb. Other constituents that often
    appear in the phrase are pre-modifiers (which come before the adverb) and post-
    modifiers (which come after the adverb):

    quite (pre-mod.) neatly (adv.)
    very (pre-mod.) luckily (adv.) for me (post-mod.)

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Sentence Structure and Verb Phrases\n\nCompare the active and passive verb phrases in the provided text, using the examples: ''loves'' vs ''is loved'', ''will proclaim'' vs ''will be proclaimed''.\n- **Part A**: Explain the structural difference between active and passive verb phrases, using the example of ''is investigating'' vs ''is being investigated''.\n- **Part B**: Construct a sentence in passive voice using the active sentence ''The police are investigating the crime'', and show how the subject is repositioned into a by-phrase.\n- **Part C**: Identify and explain the function of the verb phrase ''is being investigated'' in the sentence ''The crime is being investigated by the police''.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of active and passive voice, including the role of the verb phrase and subject repositioning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Analysis of Adjective and Adverb Functions\n\nUsing the definitions provided in the text, analyze the following phrases:\n- **Phrase 1**: ''quite hungry''\n- **Phrase 2**: ''very happy to see you''\n- **Phrase 3**: ''frequently visit my family''\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: For each phrase, identify whether the main word is an adjective or adverb and explain its function (pre-modifier, post-modifier, etc.).\n- **Part B**: Differentiate between central adjectives and non-central adjectives using the example of ''conscientious'' in ''a conscientious student''.\n- **Part C**: Create a sentence that demonstrates both an adjective and an adverb, ensuring the adverb is used as an adverbial modifier.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must accurately categorize each phrase and demonstrate an understanding of adjective/adverb distinctions.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Logical Reasoning with Adjective and Adverb Phrases\n\nThe text distinguishes between attributive, predicative, and central adjectives. Similarly, adverbs can function as modifiers of other adverbs or adjectives. Using this information:\n- **Part A**: Explain why the adjective ''conscientious'' is classified as a central adjective in ''She is conscientious''.\n- **Part B**: Construct an adverb phrase that includes both a pre-modifier and a post-modifier, such as ''quite neatly for me''.\n- **Part C**: Disprove the claim that all adverbs must modify verbs by providing an example where an adverb modifies another adverb.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of adjective and adverb classifications, including their functions in sentence structure.'

- prompt: "An adverbial is an optional element that is chiefly used to convey information  \nabout the circumstances of the situation depicted in the basic structure of the  \nsentence. There may be more than one adverbial in a sentence:  \n\nEvery year (A1) they rented a car for two weeks (A2) to tour some European  \ncountry (A3).  \n\nIn the above sentence, the adverbials convey information on frequency in time  \n(A1), duration of time (A2), and purpose (A3).  \n\nWe should distinguish the adverbial from the adverb. Like a noun, an adverb is  \na member of a word class.  \n\nAn adverbial complement is an element that conveys the same information as  \nsome adverbials but is required by the verb:  \n\nI am now living in Manhattan.  \n\nThe verb that most commonly requires an adverbial complement to complete the  \nsentence is the verb be, as in ‘She is on the way to New Zealand'. An adverbial  \ncomplement (aC) is also required by some transitive verbs to follow a direct object  \n\n(dO). See Object:  \nI put my car (dO) in the garage (aC).  \n\nadverbial clause  \nAn adverbial clause is a clause that functions as adverbial in sentence structure.  \n\nadverbial complement  \nAn adverbial complement is an obligatory element in sentence structure. See  \nAdverbial.  \n\nalternative question  \nAn alternative question is a question that presents two or more choices and asks  \nthe hearer to choose one of them:  \n\nDo you want a biscuit or (do you want) a piece of cake?  \n\nantecedent  \nThe antecedent of a pronoun is the unit that the pronoun refers to. The antecedent  \nusually comes before the pronoun:  \n\nThe brakes were defective when I examined them.  \n\nanticipatory it  \nThe pronoun it is called ‘anticipatory it' when the sentence is so structured that  \nthe pronoun takes the position of the subject and the subject is moved to the end:  \n\nIt is a pity that Sue is not here.

    Peter, your youngest brother, has just arrived.

    Typically, the two units are identical in the kind of unit (here two noun phrases),
    in what they refer to (Peter and your youngest brother refer to the same person), and
    in having the same potential function, so that either can be omitted (Peter has just
    arrived and Your youngest brother has just arrived are both acceptable). See also
    Appositive clause.

    270 = An Introduction to English Grammar

    appositive clause
    An appositive clause is a type of clause that functions as a post-modifier in a noun
    phrase:

    the reason that I am here today

    The conjunction that does not function in the clause (cf. Relative clause). Since
    the clause is in apposition to the noun phrase, the two units correspond to a
    sentence structure in which they are linked by a form of the verb be:

    The reason is that I am here today.

    aspect

    Aspect is the grammatical category in the verb phrase that refers to the way that
    the time of the situation is viewed by the speaker. There are two aspects: perfect
    and progressive. The perfect combines a form of auxiliary have with the -ed
    participle: has shouted, had worked, may have said. The progressive combines a
    form of auxiliary be with the -ing participle: is shouting, was working, may be saying.

    auxiliary

    Auxiliary (‘helping') verbs typically come before the main verb (see in the follow-
    ing examples) in a verb phrase: can see, has been seeing, should have been seen. The
    auxiliaries are:

    1. modals: e.g. can, could, may, might, should, will, would
    2. perfect auxiliary: have

    3. progressive auxiliary: be

    4. passive auxiliary: be

    5. dummy operator: do

    base form

    The base form of the verb is the form without any inflection. It is the entry word
    for a verb in dictionaries.

    basic sentence structure
    The seven basic sentence or clause structures are:

    SV: subject + verb

    SVA: subject + verb + adverbial (complement)

    SVC: subject + verb + (subject) complement

    SVO: subject + verb + (direct) object

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structure and Aspect**\n\nConsider the sentence: "Peter has just arrived."\n- **Part A**: Identify the basic sentence structure of this sentence (SV, SVA, SVC, or SVO) and explain why.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the aspect of the verb in this sentence (perfect or progressive) and justify your answer using the definitions provided.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the aspect of "Peter has just arrived" with that of "Peter is arriving."

Justify your answer using the definitions provided.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the use of different auxiliary verbs affects the meaning and tense of the sentences. Provide an example from the text that illustrates this difference.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of auxiliary verbs and their role in verb phrase construction.'

One or more optional adverbials may be added to the basic structures.  \n\ncase  \nCase is a distinction in nouns and pronouns that is related to their grammatical functions. Nouns have two cases: the common case (child, children) and the genitive case (child's, children's). The genitive noun phrase is generally equivalent to an of-phrase:  \n\nthe child's parents  \nthe parents of the child  \n\nIn the child's parents, the genitive phrase is a dependent genitive: it functions like a determiner.

    272 An Introduction to English Grammar

    In a wider sense, a clause may coincide with a sentence, since a simple sentence
    consists of just one clause.

    cleft sentence

    A cleft sentence is a sentence divided into three parts. The first has the subject zt
    and a form of the verb be; the emphasized part comes next; and the final part is
    what would be the rest of the sentence in a regular pattern.

    It was Betty that I wanted to see. (cf. ‘I wanted to see Betty.')
    It was after lunch that I phoned John. (cf. ‘I phoned John after lunch.')

    collective noun
    A collective noun refers to a group, e.g. audience, class, family, herd, jury.

    comma splice See Run-on sentence.

    comparative clause
    Comparative clauses are introduced by than or as and involve a comparison.

    Adam is happier than he used to be.
    Paul is as good a student as you are.

    complement

    A complement is the unit that may or must be introduced to complete the meaning
    of a word. For example, a preposition (e.g. for) is normally followed by a noun
    phrase (e.g. my best friend) as its complement, as in for my best friend. See Object,
    Object complement, Subject complement.

    complex sentence

    A complex sentence is a sentence that contains one or more subordinate clauses.
    The subordinate clause may function as a sentence element [1] or as a post-
    modifier in a phrase [2] and [3]:

    [1] Jean told me that she would be late.
    [2] This is the man who was asking for you.
    [3] We are glad that you could be here.

    compound
    A compound is a word formed from the combination of two words: handmade,
    user-friendly.

    compound sentence
    A compound sentence is a sentence that consists of two or more clauses linked by
    a coordinator. The coordinators are and, or, and but:

    Glossary

    She is a superb administrator and everybody knows it.
    We can go in my car or we can take a bus.
    He felt quite ill but he refused to leave his post.

    See 6.6.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Cleft Sentence Structure Analysis**\n\nConstruct a cleft sentence to emphasize the time ''three days ago'' in the context of a story about a meeting. The original sentence is: ''I met John three days ago.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the subject and verb of the original sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the emphasized part (the time ''three days ago'').\n- **Step 3**: Apply the structure of a cleft sentence: ''It was [emphasized part] that [rest of the sentence].''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your cleft sentence must correctly emphasize the time and adhere to the structure described in the text. You must also explain why this sentence structure is used for emphasis, referencing the definition of a cleft sentence from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Comparative Clause Construction**\n\nWrite a comparative clause to compare the speed of two vehicles, one described as ''fast'' and the other as ''very fast.'' The original sentence is: ''Car A is faster than Car B.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the subject and the two compared elements (Car A and Car B).\n- **Step 2**: Determine the comparative form of ''fast'' (faster) and the structure required for a comparative clause.\n- **Step 3**: Construct the sentence using the correct grammar pattern described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must use the comparative clause structure introduced by ''than'' and correctly compare the two vehicles. You must also explain how this structure functions in comparison, based on the text''s description of comparative clauses.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Collective Noun Application**\n\nCreate a sentence that uses the collective noun ''audience'' to describe a scenario where the audience is reacting to a performance.

- prompt: "conditional clause  \nA conditional clause is a clause that expresses a condition on which something else  \nis dependent:  \n\nIf they hurry, they can catch the earlier flight.  \n\nThe sentence conveys the proposition that their ability to catch the earlier flight is  \ndependent on their hurrying.  \n\nconjunction  \nThe two classes of conjunctions are coordinators (or coordinating conjunctions)  \nand subordinators (or subordinating conjunctions). The coordinators are and, or,  \nand but. They link units of equal status (those having a similar function), e.g.  \nclauses, phrases, pre-modifiers. Subordinators (e.g. because, if) introduce subordin-  \nate clauses:  \n\nThe baby is crying because she is hungry.  \n\nconversion  \n\nConversion is the process by which a word is changed from one class to a new class  \nwithout any change in its form. For example, the verb bottle (‘put into a bottle') is  \nderived by conversion from the noun bottle.  \n\ncoordination  \nCoordination is the linking of two or more units with the same function. The  \ncoordinators (or coordinating conjunctions) are and, or, and but:  \n\nThere is a heavy duty on cigarettes, cigars, and pipe tobacco.  \nThey pierced their ears or noses.  \nWe waited, but nobody came.  \n\ncoordinator See Conjunction.  \n\ncount noun  \nCount nouns refer to things that can be counted, and they therefore have a singular  \nand a plural: college, colleges. Non-count nouns have only the singular form: imforma-  \ntion, software.  \n\n273  \n274 An Introduction to English Grammar  \n\ndangling modifier  \nA dangling modifier is an adverbial clause that has no subject, but its implied  \nsubject is not intended to be identified with the subject of the sentence:  \n\nBeing blind, a dog guided her across the street.  \nThe implied subject of being blind is not intended to be a dog.  \n\ndeclarative  \nA declarative sentence is a type of sentence structure used chiefly for making  \nstatements. In declaratives, the subject generally comes before the verb.  \n\nSandra is on the radio.  \n\nI'm not joking.  \n\nI'll send you an email.  \n\nMuch more work will be required to analyse the data before we can  \nannounce our conclusions.  \n\ndeclarative question  \nA declarative question has the form of a declarative sentence but the force of a  \nquestion:  \n\nShe agrees with us?\n\nThe text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson."

- prompt: |-
    A formal definition defines a grammatical term, such as adverb, by the form of
    members of the category. For example, most adverbs end in -y. In a wider sense,
    form includes structure. The form or structure of a noun phrase may be described
    as consisting of a noun or pronoun as the main word plus other possible constituents, such as determiners and modifiers. See Structure. Formal definitions are
    contrasted with notional definitions.

    fragmentary sentence

    Fragmentary sentences are irregular sentences from which some part or parts are
    missing that are normally present in corresponding regular sentences. We can
    ‘regularize' the fragmentary sentence im the kitchen in this exchange:

    A: Where are you?
    B: In the kitchen.

    In the kitchen corresponds to the regular sentence I am in the kitchen.

    front-focus
    Front-focus is a device for fronting an expression from its normal position so that
    it will acquire greater prominence:

    Ronald I like, but Doris I respect.

    Here the two direct objects have been fronted from their normal position after
    the verb.

    function
    The function of a unit refers to its use within another unit. For example, the
    function of your sister is subject in [1] and object in [2]:

    [1] Your sister is over there.
    [2] I have already met your sister.

    gender

    Gender is a grammatical distinction among words of the same word class that
    refers to contrasts such as masculine, feminine, neuter. In English this distinction
    is found mainly in certain pronouns and in the possessive determiners.

    generic
    Noun phrases are generic when they refer to a class as a whole:

    Dogs make good pets.

    They are non-generic when they refer to individual members of a class:
    My dogs are good with children.

    genitive case See Case.

    gradable

    Words are gradable when they can be viewed as being on a scale of degree of
    intensity. Adjectives and adverbs are typically gradable: they can be modified by
    intensifiers such as very (extremely hot, very badly), and they can take comparison
    (happier, more relevant).

    grammar
    The grammar is the set of rules for combining words into larger units. For
    example, the rules for the grammar of standard English allow:

    Home computers are now much cheaper.
    They disallow:

- prompt: |-
    [1] Home computers now much are cheaper.
    [2] Home computers 7s now much cheaper.

    They disallow [1] because much is positioned wrongly. They disallow [2] because the subject and the verb must agree in number, and the subject Home computers is plural whereas the verb is is singular.

    Such rules are descriptive rules: they describe what speakers of the language actually use. There are also prescriptive rules, which advise people what they should use. These are found in style manuals, handbooks, and other books that advise people how to use their language, telling people which usages to adopt or avoid. The prescriptive rules refer to usages that are common among speakers of standard English, perhaps mainly when they are speaking informally; for example:

    Glossary
    Don't use "ike" as a conjunction, as in "Speak like I do."

    grammatical sentence

    A grammatical sentence in English is a sentence that conforms to the rules of the grammar of standard English. In a wider sense, grammatical sentences are sentences that conform to the rules of any variety, so that it is possible to distinguish between grammatical and non-grammatical sentences in different varieties of non-standard English.

    homograph See Homonym.

    homonym

    Homonyms are two or more words that are identical in sound or spelling but different in meaning: the verb "peep" refers either to making a kind of sound or to taking a kind of look. Homophones share the same sound but not necessarily the same spelling, e.g. "weigh" and "way". Homographs share the same spelling but not necessarily the same sound, e.g. "row" (‘line of objects' when it rhymes with "no", or 'quarrel' when it rhymes with "zo").

    homophone See Homonym.

    hypotaxis
    Hypotaxis refers to the grammatical relationship between clauses based on coordination or subordination. Compare: Parataxis.

    imperative

    An imperative sentence is a type of sentence structure used chiefly for issuing a directive. The imperative verb has the base form. The subject is generally absent, and in that case the missing subject is understood to be you:

    Take off your hat.
    Make yourself at home.

    There are also first and third person imperative sentences with "let" and a subject:

    indefinite article
    The indefinite article is a or (before a vowel sound) an. Compare: Definite article.

    indefinite pronoun
    Indefinite pronouns are pronouns that refer to the quantity of persons or things.
    They include sets of words ending in -one and -body (someone, nobody, everybody),

    279

    280 An Introduction to English Grammar

    many, few, both, either, neither, some, any. Some of these pronouns have the same
    form as indefinite determiners.

    independent genitive See Case.
    indicative See Mood.

    indirect object See Object.
    indirect speech See Direct speech.

    infinitive

    The infinitive has the base form of the verb. It is often preceded by ¢o (to stay, to
    knock), but the infinitive without Zo is used after the central modals (may stay, will
    knock) and after dummy operator do (did say).

    inflection See Suffix.

    interrogative

    An interrogative sentence is a type of sentence structure used chiefly for asking
    questions. In interrogatives the operator comes before the subject or the sentence
    begins with an interrogative word (e.g. who, how, why) or with an interrogative
    expression (e.g. on which day, for how long):

    Did you hear that noise?
    Why is Pat so annoyed?
    At which point should I stop?

    interrogative pronoun
    The interrogative pronouns are who, whom, which and what.

    intransitive verb
    An intransitive verb does not require another element to complete the sentence:

    Peter yawned.
    The baby Jaughed.

    It has been raining.

    Intransitive verbs contrast with transitive verbs, which take an object; for example,
    the transitive verb take is followed by the object my book in this next sentence:

    Somebody has taken my book.

    Glossary 281
    Many verbs may be either intransitive or transitive, for example play:

    They were playing.
    They were playing football.

    A compound sentence [3] consists of two or more main clauses:

    [3] I know that you are in a hurry, but you should be more careful when you
    cross the street.

    In [3], but joins the two main clauses.

    main verb

    A main verb is the main word in a verb phrase. Regular main verbs have four
    forms: the base, -s, -ing, and -ed forms. The base form (e.g. talk) has no inflection;
    the other three forms are named after their inflections (talks, talking, talked). Some
    irregular verbs have five forms, two of them corresponding to the two uses of the
    regular -ed form: past (spoke) and -ed participle (spoken); others have four forms,
    but the -ed form is irregular (spent); others still have only three forms, since the
    base and the -ed forms are identical (put). The highly irregular verb be has eight
    different forms. See 4.12 and 5.11.

    medium

    The medium is the channel in which the language is used. The main distinction is
    between speech and writing.

    modal

    The central modals (or central modal auxiliaries) are can, could, may, might, will,
    would, shall, should, must.

    mood

    Mood is the grammatical category that indicates the attitude of the speaker to what
    is said. Finite verb phrases have three moods: indicative, imperative, and subjunctive.

    282 An Introduction to English Grammar

    The indicative is the usual mood in declarative, interrogative, and exclamative
    sentences. The imperative mood is used in imperative sentences. The subjunctive
    mood commonly conveys uncertainty or tentativeness. See 4.19.

    morphology

    Morphology deals with the structure of words. Words may be combinations of
    smaller units. For example, books consists of the stem book and the inflection -s.
    Sometimes is a compound formed from the two stems some and times. Review con-
    sists of the prefix re- and the stem view, and national consists of the stem nation
    and the suffix -al.

    Multi-word verbs are combinations of a verb and one or more other words. The
    major types are phrasal verbs (give im), prepositional verbs (/ook at), and phrasal-
    prepositional verbs (put up with).

    neutralization
    Neutralization involves reducing distinctions to one form. For example, you rep-
    resents both the subjective form (You saw them) and the objective form (They saw

    you).

    nominal clause

    Nominal clauses are subordinate clauses that have a range of functions similar
    to that of noun phrases. For example, they can function as subject [1] or direct
    object [2]:

    [1] That 1t's too difficult for him should be obvious to everyone.
    [2] I think that you should take a rest now.

    Nominal relative clauses are introduced by a nominal relative pronoun. The
    pronoun functions like a combination of antecedent and relative pronoun:

    You can take whatever you want. (‘anything you want')
    nominal relative clause See Nominal clause.

    nominal relative pronoun

    The nominal relative pronouns are who, whom (formal), which, whoever, whomever
    (formal), whichever, what, and whatever. They introduce nominal relative clauses.
    Several of these pronouns have the same form as nominal relative determiners.

    A notional definition defines a grammatical term, such as a noun, by the meaning that members of the category are said to convey. For example, a traditional notional definition of a noun is ‘the name of a person, thing, or place'. Notional definitions can help to identify a category such as a noun by indicating typical members of the category, but the definitions are usually not comprehensive. Nouns include words such as happiness, information, and action that are not covered by the traditional notional definition. Notional definitions are contrasted with formal definitions.

    noun

    Proper nouns are names of people (Helen), places (Hong Kong), days of the week (Monday), holidays (Christmas), etc. The noun phrases in which common nouns function refer to people (teachers), places (the city), things (your car), qualities (elegance), states (knowledge), actions (action), etc. Most common nouns take a plural form: car, cars.

    noun phrase

    The main word in a noun phrase is a noun or a pronoun. If the main word is a noun, it is often introduced by a determiner and may have modifiers. Pre-modifiers are modifiers that come before the main word and post-modifiers are modifiers that come after it:

    an (det.) old (premod.) quarrel (noun) that has recently flared up again
    (post-mod.)

    284 An Introduction to English Grammar

    number
    Number is a grammatical category that contrasts singular and plural. It applies to nouns (student, students), pronouns (she, they), and verbs (he works, they work).

    object
    Transitive verbs require a direct object to complete the sentence as in [1]:

    [1] Helen wore a red dress (dO).

    Some transitive verbs allow or require a second element: indirect object, which comes before the direct object [2]; object complement [3]; adverbial complement [4].

    [2] Nancy showed me (iO) her book (dO).
    [3] Pauline made him (dO) her understudy (oC).
    [4] Norma put the cat (dO) in the yard (aC).

- prompt: |-
    The direct object typically refers to the person or thing affected by the action. The
    indirect object typically refers to the person who receives something or benefits
    from the action. The object in an active structure (whether the object is direct or
    indirect) usually corresponds to the subject in a passive structure:

    The sentry fired two shots (dO).

    Two shots (S) were fired.

    Ted promised Mary (iO) two tickets (dO).
    Mary (S) was promised two tickets.

    Two tickets (S) were promised to Mary.

    object complement
    Some transitive verbs require or allow an object complement to follow the direct
    object:

    The heat has turned the milk (dO) sour (oC).

    The relationship between the direct object and the object complement resembles
    that between the subject and subject complement:

    The milk (S) turned sour (sC).
    See Object.

    objective case See Subjective case.

    Glossary 285

    operator

    The operator is the part of the predicate that (among other functions) interchanges
    with the subject when we form questions [1] and comes before not or contracted n't
    in negative sentences [2] and [3]:

    [1] Have (op) you (S) seen my pen?
    [2] I have (op) not replied to her letter.
    [3] I haven't replied to her letter.

    The operator is usually the first auxiliary in the verb phrase, but the main verb be
    is the operator when it is the only verb in the verb phrase, as in [4], while the main
    verb ave may serve as operator, as in [5], or take the dummy operator, as in [6]:

    [4] Are you ready?
    [5] Have you a car?
    [6] Do you have a car?

    orthographic sentence
    An orthographic sentence is a sentence in the written language, signalled by an
    initial capital letter and a final full-stop (period).

    orthography
    Orthography is the writing system in the language: the distinctive written symbols
    and their possible combinations.

    parallelism
    Parallelism is an arrangement of similar grammatical structures. In parallel struc-
    tures at least some of the words have similar or contrasting meanings:

    parataxis

    Parataxis refers to the loose ‘stringing together' of (usually) clauses, without any
    grammatical relation between them: It was midnight. It was dark. The door opened.
    Compare: Hypotaxis.

    286 An Introduction to English Grammar

    particle

    A particle is a word that does not change its form (unlike verbs that have past
    forms or nouns that have plural forms) and, because of its specialized functions,
    does not fit into the traditional classes of words. Particles include not, to as used
    with the infinitive, and words like up and out that combine with verbs to form
    multi-word verbs, for example, blow up and look out.

    participle
    There are two participles, the -ing participle (playing) and the -ed participle. The
    -ing participle always ends in -ing. In all regular verbs and in some irregular verbs,
    the -ed participle ends in -ed. In other irregular verbs the -ed participle may end in
    -n (speak — spoken), or may have a different vowel from the base form (fight —
    fought), or may have both characteristics (wear — worn), or may be identical with
    the base form (put — put).

    The -ing participle is used to form the progressive (was playing). The -ed
    participle is used to form the perfect (has played) and the passive (was played).
    Both participles can function as the verb in non-finite clauses:

    Speaking before the game, Keegan was upbeat and optimistic.
    When captured, he refused to give his name.

    Person is the grammatical category that indicates differences in the relationship to the speaker of those involved in the situation. There are three persons: the first person refers to the speaker, the second to those addressed, and the third to other people or things. Differences are signalled by the possessive determiners (my, your etc.), some pronouns (e.g. I, you), and by verb forms (e.g. I know versus She knows).

    personal pronoun
    The personal pronouns are:

    1. subjective case: I, we, you, he, she, it, they
    2. objective case: me, us, you, him, her, it, them

    See Subjective case.

    Glossary 287
    phonetics

    Phonetics deals with the physical characteristics of the sounds in the language,
    their production, and their perception.

    phonology
    Phonology is the sound system in the language: the distinctive sound units and the
    ways in which they may be combined.

    phrasal auxiliary

    Phrasal auxiliaries convey meanings that are similar to the auxiliaries but do not
    share all their grammatical characteristics. For example, only the first word of the
    phrasal auxiliary Have got to functions as an operator:

    Have we got to go now?
    Phrasal auxiliaries include have to, had better, be about to, be going to, be able to.
    phrasal-prepositional verb See Multi-word verb.
    phrasal verb. See Multi-word verb.

    phrase
    A phrase is a unit below the clause. There are five types of phrases:

    noun phrase our family
    verb phrase was talking
    adjective phrase quite old
    adverb phrase very loudly
    prepositional phrase on the table

    The first four phrases above are named after their main word. The prepositional
    phrase is named after the word that introduces the phrase. In this book, and in
    many other works on grammar, a phrase may consist of one word, so that both
    talked and was talking are verb phrases. See 4.1.

    possessive determiner
    The possessive determiners are my, our, your, his, her, its, their. See Case.

    possessive pronoun
    The possessive pronouns are mine, ours, yours, his, hers, its, theirs. See Case.

    Pragmatics

    Pragmatics deals with the use of utterances in particular situations. For example,
    Will you join our group? is a question that might be intended as either a request for
    information or a request for action.

    predicate
    We can divide most clauses into two parts; the subject and the predicate. The
    main parts of the predicate are the verb and any of its objects or complements.

    prefix
    A prefix is added before the stem of a word to form a new word, e.g. un- in untidy.

    preposition

    Prepositions introduce prepositional phrases. The preposition links the com-
    plement in the phrase to some other expression. Here are some common preposi-
    tions with complements in parentheses: after (lunch), by (telling me), for (us), in (my
    room), since (seeing them), to (Ruth), up (the road).

    prepositional object
    A prepositional object is a word or phrase that follows the preposition of a preposi-
    tional verb:

    Tom is looking after my children.
    Norma is making fun of you.

    prepositional phrase
    The prepositional phrase consists of a preposition and the complement of the

    preposition:

    for (prep.) your sake (comp.)
    on (prep.) entering the room (comp.)

    prepositional verb See Multi-word verb.

    prescriptive rules See Grammar.

    progressive See Aspect.

    pronoun

    A pronoun is a closed class of words that are used as substitutes for a noun phrase

    or (less commonly) for a noun. They fall into a number of classes, such as personal
    pronouns and demonstrative pronouns. See 5.17.
    Glossary

    reciprocal pronoun
    The reciprocal pronouns are each other and one another.

    reflexive pronoun
    The reflexive pronouns are myself, ourselves, yourself, yourselves, himself, herself,
    itself, themselves.

    register

    A linguistic register is a variety of language that we associate with a specific use and
    communicative purpose. For example, conversational English, newspaper English,
    and scientific English are commonly recognized registers.

    regular sentence

    A regular sentence conforms to one of the major sentence patterns in the language
    (see 3.13). Those that do not conform are irregular sentences. See Basic sentence
    structure.

    They are non-specific when they do not have such reference:
    I have never met a Russian. (non-specific: ‘any Russian')

    standard English

    Standard English is the variety of English that normally appears in print. Its
    relative uniformity is confined to grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and punctuation.
    There is no standard English pronunciation. There are some differences in the
    standard English used in English-speaking countries, so that we can distinguish,
    for example, between standard English in Britain, in the USA, and in Canada.
    Varieties other than the standard variety are called non-standard.

    stative

    Stative verbs introduce a quality attributed to the subject (Tom seems bored) or a
    state of affairs (We know the way). Dynamic verbs are used in descriptions of
    events (The kettle is boiling; Cathy listened intently). Dynamic verbs can occur with
    the -ing form, as in The kettle is boiling, has been listening.

    structure
    The structure of a unit refers to the parts that make up the unit. For example, a
    sentence may have the structure subject, verb, object, as in:

    David (S) has written (V) a good paper (O).

    Or a noun phrase may have the structure determiner, pre-modifier, noun, as in:
    a (det) good (pre-mod) paper (noun)

    subject

    The subject is an element that usually comes before the verb in a declarative
    sentence [1] and after the operator in an interrogative sentence [2]:

    [1] We (S) should consider (V) the rights of every class.
    [2] Should (op) we (S) consider the rights of every class?

    Except in imperative sentences, the subject is an obligatory element. In active
    structures, the subject typically refers to the performer of the action.

    292 An Introduction to English Grammar

    subject complement
    Linking verbs require a subject complement to complete the sentence. The most
    common linking verb is be. Subject complements are usually noun phrases [1] or
    adjective phrases [2]:

    The text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson.
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structure and Verb Types**\n\nAnalyze the sentence: ''The kettle is boiling.''\n- **Part A**: Identify the sentence structure (subject, verb, object) and classify the verb as stative or dynamic. Justify your classification based on the text''s definition of stative and dynamic verbs.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the -ing form is used in this sentence, referencing the text''s explanation of dynamic verbs and the -ing form.\n- **Part C**: Compare the sentence ''The kettle has been boiling'' with ''The kettle is boiling,'' highlighting differences in tense and the implications for verb usage according to the text''s discussion of dynamic verbs.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the text''s definitions of stative/dynamic verbs and sentence structure, with clear examples from the text.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Standard English Varieties**\n\nConsider the sentence: ''I have never met a Russian.''\n- **Part A**: Explain why this sentence is considered non-specific according to the text''s definition of specific and non-specific noun phrases.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the differences between standard English in Britain, the USA, and Canada as described in the text. Provide an example of how these differences might appear in everyday language.\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence that demonstrates the use of standard English, ensuring it adheres to grammar, vocabulary, and punctuation rules as defined in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of standard English varieties and the distinction between specific and non-specific noun phrases, with clear examples from the text.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Grammatical Components**\n\nExamine the noun phrase: ''a good paper.''\n- **Part A**: Identify its structure (determiner, pre-modifier, noun) and explain how each component functions according to the text''s explanation of noun phrase structure.\n- **Part B**: Construct a similar noun phrase using different components and justify why it follows the same structural rules as ''a good paper.''\n- **Part C**: Compare the noun phrase structure with that of a sentence structure (subject, verb, object), highlighting similarities and differences in how grammatical components are organized.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s explanations of noun phrase and sentence structure, with clear examples from the text.'

- prompt: "[1] Leonard is Mary's brother  \n[2] Robert looks very happy.  \n\nThe subject complement typically identifies or characterizes the subject.  \n\nsubjective case  \n\nThe personal pronouns and the pronouns who and whoever distinguish between subjective case and objective case. The subjective case is used when a pronoun is the subject (I know). The objective case is used when a pronoun is a direct object (me in He pushed me) or indirect object (me in She told me the truth) or complement of a preposition (for me). The subject complement takes the subjective case in formal style (This is she), but otherwise the objective case (This is her) is usual.  \n\nsubject-operator inversion  \nIn subject-operator inversion, the usual order is inverted: the operator comes before the subject:  \n\n[1] Are (op) you (S) staying?  \n\nSubject-operator inversion occurs chiefly in questions, as in [1]. It also occurs when a negative element is fronted, as in [2]:  \n\n[2] Not a word did we hear.  \nCompare [2a] and [2b]:  \n\n[2a] We did not hear a word.  \n[2b] We heard not a word.  \n\nsubject-verb agreement  \nThe general rule is that a verb agrees with its subject in number and person whenever the verb displays distinctions in number and person:  \n\nThe dog barks. I am thirsty.  \nThe dogs bark. She is thirsty.  \n\nsubjunctive  \nThe present subjunctive is the base form of the verb:  \nI demanded that Norman leave the meeting.  \nIt is essential that you be on time.  \n\nThe past subjunctive is were.  \n\nIf Tess were here, she would help me.  \nSee 4.19.  \nsubordinate clause See Complex sentence.  \nsubordinator See Conjunction.  \n\nsuffix  \n\nA suffix is added after the stem of a word to form a new word, e.g. -ness in goodness.  \nA suffix that expresses a grammatical relationship is an inflection, e.g. plural -s in crowds or past -ed in cooked.  \n\nsuperordinate clause  \nA superordinate clause is a clause that has a subordinate clause as one of its elements:  \n\nI hear (A) that you know (B) where Ken lives.\n\nThe text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Subject-Verb Agreement and Inversion**\n\nConsider the following sentences:\n1. The dog barks.\n2. The dogs bark.\n3. Are you staying?\n4. Not a word did we hear.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain how the subject-verb agreement rules apply to sentences 1 and 2. Use the definitions from the text to justify your answer.\n- **Part B**: Analyze sentence 3 using subject-operator inversion. Identify the operator and subject, and explain why this structure is used in questions.\n- **Part C**: Compare sentences 4 and 4a/4b. Explain how subject-operator inversion differs in negative statements, citing the text''s examples.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of both subject-verb agreement and inversion, with clear references to the text''s definitions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Subject-Object Case and Subjunctive**\n\nWrite two sentences using the information provided in the text. One sentence must use subject complement with subjective case, and the other must use the present subjunctive.\n- **Sentence 1**: This is she. (Subject complement in subjective case)\n- **Sentence 2**: I demand that you be on time. (Present subjunctive)\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Justify why Sentence 1 uses the subjective case and not the objective.\n- **Part B**: Explain how Sentence 2 uses the present subjunctive, and why it differs from the base form of the verb.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentences must adhere strictly to the grammatical rules outlined in the text, with clear explanations of their usage.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Clauses and Suffixes**\n\nConsider the following complex sentence: ''I hear that you know where Ken lives.''\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the superordinate clause and the subordinate clause. Explain how they relate to each other based on the text''s definition of a superordinate clause.\n- **Part B**: Create an original sentence that demonstrates the use of a suffix as an inflection. Use the example given in the text (e.g., plural -s or past -ed).\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence that uses both a subordinate clause and a suffix. Explain how each part contributes to the overall meaning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate all three concepts (clauses, suffixes, and subordinate clauses) as defined in the text.'

- prompt: "The (A) clause that you know where Ken hives is superordinate to the (B) clause  \nwhere Ken lives. The subordinate (B) clause is the direct object in the (A) clause.\n\nsyntax  \nThis is another term for Grammar, as that term is used in this book.\n\ntag question  \nA tag question is attached to a sentence that is not interrogative. It invites agreement:\n\nYou remember me, don't you?  \nPlease don't tell them, will you?\n\ntense  \nTense is the grammatical category that refers to time and is signalled by the form  \nof the verb. There are two tenses: present (laughs, laughs) and past (laughed).\n\nthere-structure  \nIn a there-structure, there is put in the subject position and the subject is moved to  \n\na later position:\n\nThere is somebody here to see you. (cf. ‘Somebody is here to see you.')\n\n293  \n294 An Introduction to English Grammar\n\ntransitive Verb See Object.\n\nverb  \n\nA verb is either (like a noun) a member of a word class or (like a subject) an  \nelement in sentence or clause structure. As a verb, it functions in a verb phrase.  \nThe verb phrase may be playing is the verb of the sentence in [1]:\n\n[1] She may be playing tennis this afternoon.\n\nIt is the verb of the that-clause in [2]:\n\n[2] She says that she may be playing tennis this afternoon.  \nSee Main verb.\n\nverbless clause  \nA verbless clause is a reduced clause that does not have a verb:\n\nSend me another one if possible. (‘if it is possible')  \nThough in pain, Joan came with us. (\"Though she was in pain\")\n\nverb phrase  \nA verb phrase consists of a main verb preceded optionally by a maximum of four  \nauxiliaries.\n\nvoice  \n\nVoice is a grammatical category that applies to the structure of the sentence and to  \nthe structure of the verb phrase. There are two voices: the active voice and the  \npassive voice. See Active.\n\nwh-question  \n\nA wh-question is a question beginning with an interrogative word or with a phrase  \ncontaining an interrogative word. All interrogative words except how begin with  \nthe spelling wh-: who, whom, whose, which, what, where, when, why.\n\nThe text is from An Introduction to English Grammar-Longman by Sidney Greenbaum, Gerald Nelson."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Clause Structure and Syntax Analysis**\n\nConsider the sentence: ''The man who is wearing a red shirt is my brother.''\n- **Part A**: Identify the main clause and the subordinate clause in this sentence. Justify your answer by referencing the provided text''s explanation of subordinate clauses and their relationship to superordinate clauses.\n- **Part B**: Using the definition of a verb phrase from the text, analyze the verb phrase in the main clause. Explain how it functions within the sentence structure and relate this to the example given in the text about ''playing is the verb of the sentence.''\n- **Part C**: Construct a similar sentence using a different subordinate clause type (e.g., an adverbial clause) and explain its grammatical function based on the text''s definition of subordinate clauses.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of clause structure, syntax, and the relationships between superordinate and subordinate clauses as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Tag Questions and Tense Analysis**\n\nGiven the sentence: ''She has not finished her homework, ______.''\n- **Part A**: Complete the tag question appropriately. Justify your choice based on the text''s definition of tag questions and their role in inviting agreement.\n- **Part B**: Change the sentence to the past tense and determine the correct tag question. Explain how tense affects the form of the verb and the corresponding tag.\n- **Part C**: Contrast the use of tag questions in the present tense and past tense examples provided in the text. Discuss how the grammatical category of tense influences the construction of tag questions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must accurately apply the rules for tag questions and demonstrate a clear understanding of how tense affects sentence structure and question formation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Verb Phrases, Voice, and Wh-Questions**\n\nConsider the sentence: ''Where did you go last weekend?''\n- **Part A**: Identify the type of question and explain its structure based on the text''s definition of wh-questions.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the verb phrase in this sentence according to the text''s definition. Explain how it functions as a verb phrase and relate this to the example provided in the text about ''playing is the verb of the sentence.''\n- **Part C**: Convert the sentence into a passive voice construction. Explain how voice affects the structure of the sentence and relate this to the text''s explanation of active versus passive voices.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of verb phrases, question types, and voice in grammar as outlined in the text.'

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structure and Verb Forms**\n\nConstruct a complex sentence that contains at least two subordinate clauses, utilizing the following grammatical features:\n- A verb form that demonstrates both tense and mood (e.g., conditional or imperative)\n- A non-finite verb (gerund, participle, or infinitive)\n- An independent clause with a subject and predicate\n\n**Task**:\n1. Write the sentence, ensuring it is grammatically correct and semantically clear.\n2. Analyze each component of the sentence, specifying which grammatical rules from the text apply to each part.\n3. Justify why the chosen verb form (tense and mood) is appropriate for the sentence''s context.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly demonstrate an understanding of how different grammatical elements interact to form a coherent sentence.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Word Classes and Sentence Elements**\n\nGiven the sentence: "The quickly running dog chased the slowly walking cat across the field."\n- **Part A**: Identify and categorize each word in the sentence according to its word class (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) as per the text.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the sentence structure to determine which clause(s) are independent and which are dependent.\n- **Part C**: Explain why the words "quickly" and "slowly" are classified as adverbs rather than adjectives, using the text''s definitions of these word classes.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s definitions of word classes and sentence structure to provide a comprehensive analysis.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Verb Properties and Sentence Construction**\n\nCreate a narrative sentence that incorporates the following elements:\n- A verb in the stative form (as defined in the text)\n- A verb phrase that includes an auxiliary verb and a main verb\n- A subject-verb agreement that reflects the correct person and number\n\n**Task**:\n1. Write the sentence, ensuring it is grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.\n2. Identify each component of the sentence, specifying which grammatical rules from the text apply to each part.\n3. Discuss how the combination of these elements contributes to the sentence''s clarity and coherence.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a deep understanding of verb properties, sentence structure, and subject-verb agreement as outlined in the text.'

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Pronoun Usage in Complex Sentences**\n\nConstruct a sentence that contains both ''your'' and ''you''re'' as shown in the text. Ensure the sentence includes a prepositional object (e.g., ''about'', ''from'') and a relative pronoun (''who'', ''whom'', or ''whose'').\n- **Step 1**: Identify a situation where ''your'' and ''you''re'' can be used correctly.\n- **Step 2**: Insert a preposition and a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence.\n- **Page 104**: Use the text''s information on ''your'', ''you''re'', and relative pronouns to ensure grammatical correctness.\n**Answer Requirement**: The sentence must be grammatically correct and clearly demonstrate the use of all specified elements as per the text''s explanations.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Question Types and Sentence Structure**\n\nWrite a yes-no question that includes ''yet'' as shown in the text. The question must also contain a parallel structure (as described on page 175) and a prepositional object.\n- **Step 1**: Formulate a yes-no question using ''yet'' to express an ongoing or contrasting situation.\n- **Step 2**: Ensure the sentence has parallel structure by repeating the same grammatical form in two parts.\n- **Step 3**: Add a prepositional phrase to the question, such as ''about'' or ''from''.\n- **Page 121 and 175**: Use the text''s information on yes-no questions, parallelism, and prepositional objects to guide your construction.\n**Answer Requirement**: The question must be grammatically correct and meet all specified criteria from the text''s definitions.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Differentiation of Pronoun Roles in Sentences**\n\nWrite a sentence that uses ''whom'' as the object of a preposition and ''who'' as the subject of a verb, as described in the text. The sentence must also include ''zero relative pronouns'' (as shown on page 212) and a prepositional object.\n- **Step 1**: Identify a scenario where ''whom'' can be the object of a preposition.\n- **Step 2**: Create a clause where ''who'' serves as the subject of a verb.\n- **Step 3**: Use a zero relative pronoun (e.g., ''that'' or ''which'') to introduce a non-essential clause.\n- **Page 151, 212**: Use the text''s information on ''whom'', zero relative pronouns, and prepositional objects to ensure the sentence is grammatically correct.\n**Answer Requirement**: The sentence must be grammatically correct and clearly demonstrate the use of all specified elements as per the text''s explanations.'
