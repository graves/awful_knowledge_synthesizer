E.g. \"(W closed)\" means a warning in the \"closed\" category.\n\n       Optional warnings are enabled by using the \"warnings\" pragma or the -w\n       and -W switches.  Warnings may be captured by setting $SIG{__WARN__} to\n       a reference to a routine that will be called on each warning instead of\n       printing it.  See perlvar."

Mixing of different rule types is forbidden, so\n\t   the operation was not done; instead the result is the indicated\n\t   value, which is the best available that uses entirely Unicode\n\t   rules.  That turns out to almost always be the original character,\n\t   unchanged.\n\n\t   It is generally a bad idea to mix non-UTF-8 locales and Unicode,\n\t   and this issue is one of the reasons why.  This warning is raised\n\t   when Unicode rules would normally cause the result of this\n\t   operation to contain a character that is in the range specified by\n\t   the locale, 0..255, and hence is subject to the locale's rules, not\n\t   Unicode's.\n\n\t   If you are using locale purely for its characteristics related to\n\t   things like its numeric and time formatting (and not \"LC_CTYPE\"),\n\t   consider using a restricted form of the locale pragma (see \"The\n\t   \"use locale\" pragma\" in perllocale) like\n\t   \"\"use locale ':not_characters'\"\"."

Turkish and some related\n\t   languages have two types of \"I\" characters.\tOne is dotted in both\n\t   upper- and lowercase, and the other is dotless in both cases.\n\t   Unicode allows a locale to use either the Turkish rules, or the\n\t   rules used in all other instances, where there is only one type of\n\t   \"I\", which is dotless in the uppercase, and dotted in the lower.\n\t   The perl core does not (yet) handle the Turkish case, and this\n\t   message warns you of that.  Instead, the Unicode::Casing module\n\t   allows you to mostly implement the Turkish casing rules.\n\n\t   The other common cause is for the characters\n\n\t    $ + < = > ^ ` | ~\n\n\t   These are problematic.  The C standard says that these should be\n\t   considered punctuation in the C locale (and the POSIX standard\n\t   defers to the C standard), and Unicode is generally considered a\n\t   superset of the C locale.  But Unicode has added an extra category,\n\t   \"Symbol\", and classifies these particular characters as being\n\t   symbols.  Most UTF-8 locales have them treated as punctuation, so\n\t   that ispunct(2) returns non-zero for them.  But a few locales have\n\t   it return 0.
