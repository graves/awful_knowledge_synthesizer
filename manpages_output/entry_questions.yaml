If this option is the empty string,\n       the normal background color is used.\n       [-disabledforeground disabledForeground] Specifies the foreground color\n       to use when the entry is disabled.  If this option is the empty string,\n       the normal foreground color is used.  [-invalidcommand or\n       -invcmd invalidCommand] Specifies a script to eval when validateCommand\n       returns 0.  Setting it to {} disables this feature (the default).  The\n       best use of this option is to set it to bell.  See Validation below for\n       more information.  [-readonlybackground readonlyBackground] Specifies\n       the background color to use when the entry is readonly.\tIf this option\n       is the empty string, the normal background color is used.  [-show show]\n       If this option is specified, then the true contents of the entry are\n       not displayed in the window.  Instead, each character in the entry's\n       value will be displayed as the first character in the value of this\n       option, such as “*”.  This is useful, for example, if the entry is to\n       be used to enter a password.  If characters in the entry are selected\n       and copied elsewhere, the information copied will be what is displayed,\n       not the true contents of the entry.  [-state state] Specifies one of\n       three states for the entry:  normal, disabled, or readonly.  If the\n       entry is readonly, then the value may not be changed using widget\n       commands and no insertion cursor will be displayed, even if the input\n       focus is in the widget; the contents of the widget may still be\n       selected.  If the entry is disabled, the value may not be changed, no\n       insertion cursor will be displayed, the contents will not be\n       selectable, and the entry may be displayed in a different color,\n       depending on the values of the -disabledforeground and\n       -disabledbackground options.  [-validate validate] Specifies the mode\n       in which validation should operate: none, focus, focusin, focusout,\n       key, or all.  It defaults to none.  When you want validation, you must\n       explicitly state which mode you wish to use.  See Validation below for\n       more.  [-validatecommand or -vcmd validateCommand] Specifies a script\n       to eval when you want to validate the input into the entry widget.\n       Setting it to {} disables this feature (the default).  This command\n       must return a valid Tcl boolean value.  If it returns 0 (or the valid\n       Tcl boolean equivalent) then it means you reject the new edition and it\n       will not occur and the invalidCommand will be evaluated if it is set.\n       If it returns 1, then the new edition occurs.  See Validation below for\n       more information.  [-width width] Specifies an integer value indicating\n       the desired width of the entry window, in average-size characters of\n       the widget's font.  If the value is less than or equal to zero, the\n       widget picks a size just large enough to hold its current text.\n______________________________________________________________________________"

Additional options, described\n       above, may be specified on the command line or in the option database\n       to configure aspects of the entry such as its colors, font, and relief.\n       The entry command returns its pathName argument.  At the time this\n       command is invoked, there must not exist a window named pathName, but\n       pathName's parent must exist.\n\n       An entry is a widget that displays a one-line text string and allows\n       that string to be edited using widget commands described below, which\n       are typically bound to keystrokes and mouse actions.  When first\n       created, an entry's string is empty.  A portion of the entry may be\n       selected as described below.  If an entry is exporting its selection\n       (see the exportSelection option), then it will observe the standard X11\n       protocols for handling the selection;  entry selections are available\n       as type STRING.\tEntries also observe the standard Tk rules for dealing\n       with the input focus.  When an entry has the input focus it displays an\n       insertion cursor to indicate where new characters will be inserted."
