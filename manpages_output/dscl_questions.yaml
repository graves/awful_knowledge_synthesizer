Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `dscl`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     dscl is a general-purpose utility for operating on Directory Service\n     directory nodes.  Its commands allow one to create, read, and manage\n     Directory Service data.  If invoked without any commands, dscl runs in an\n     interactive mode, reading commands from standard input.  Interactive\n     processing is terminated by the quit command.  Leading dashes (\"-\") are\n     optional for all commands.\n\n     dscl operates on a datasource specified on the command line.  This may be\n     a node name or a Mac OS X Server (10.2 or later) host specified by DNS\n     hostname or IP address.  Node names may be absolute paths beginning with\n     a slash (\"/\"), or relative domain paths beginning with a dot (\".\")\n     character, which specifies the local domain, or \"..\", specifying the\n     local domain's parent.  If the hostname or IP address form is used then\n     the user must specify the -u option and either the -P or -p options to\n     specify an administrative user and password on the remote host to\n     authenticate with to the remote host. The exception to this is if\n     \"localhost\" is specified.\tPassing passwords on the command line is\n     inherently insecure and can cause password exposure.  For better security\n     do not provide the password as part of the command and you will be\n     securely prompted."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `dscl`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe datasource may also be specified as \"localonly\" in which case a\n     separate DirectoryService daemon process is activated which contains only\n     the Local plugin for use by dscl.\tIf no file path is provided then\n     access goes only to the registered local nodes on the system. However, if\n     the -f option is specified then access is added to the local node\n     \"/Local/Target\" which points to the database located at the provided\n     filepath. One example is to provide the filepath of\n     \"/Volumes/Build100/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default\" and then access to that\n     database is provided via the nodename \"/Local/Target\".\n\nPATH SPECIFICATION\n     There are two modes of operation when specifying paths to operate on. The\n     two modes correspond to whether the datasource is a node or a host. In\n     the case of specifying a node, the top level of paths will be record\n     types. Example top level paths would be:\n\n\t   /Users/alice\n\t   /Groups/admin\n\n     In the case of specifying a host as a data source, the top level of paths\n     correspond to Open Directory plug-ins and Search Paths. One can specify\n     the plug-in to traverse to a node name, after which the paths are\n     equivalent to the former usage. The following might be the equivalent\n     paths as the above paths:"

    If The -raw flag for raw output has been given, then read prints the full
         DirectoryService API constant for record and attribute types.

         If the -url flag has been specified then printed record path attribute
         values are encoded in the style of URLs. This is useful if a script or
         program is trying to process the output since values will not have any
         spaces or other control characters.

       readall
         Usage: readall [path [key ...]]

         readall prints all the records of a given type.  The output of readall is
         formatted in the same way as read with a "-" on a line as a delimeter
         between records.

       readpl
         Usage: readpl path key plist_path

         Prints the contents of plist_path. The plist_path is followed by a colon,
         then a whitespace, and then the value for the path.

         If the plist_path is the key for a dictionary or array, the contents of
         it are displayed in plist form after the plist_path. If plist_path is the
         key for a string, number, bool, date, or data object, only the value is
         printed out after the plist_path.

         Usage: readpli path key value_index plist_path

         Prints the contents of plist_path for the plist at value_index of the
         key.  The plist_path is followed by a colon, then a whitespace, and then
         the value for the path.

         If the plist_path is the key for a dictionary or array, the contents of

         printed out after the plist_path.

       list (ls)
         Usage: list path

         Lists the subdirectories of the given directory.  Subdirectories are
         listed one per line.  In the case of listing a search path, the names are
         preceded by an index number that can act as a shortcut and used in place
         of the name when specifying a path.

         When used in interactive mode, the path is optional.  With no path given,
         the current directory will be used.

       search
         path key val

         Searches for records that match a pattern.  The search is rooted at the
         given path.  The path may be a node path or a record type path.  Valid
         keys are Directory Service record attribute types.

    create (mk)
         Usage: create record_path [key [val ...]]

         Creates a record, property, or value.  If only a record path is given,
         the create command will create the record if it does not exist.  If a key
         is given, then a property with that key will be created.

         WARNING - If a property with the given key already exists, it will be
         destroyed and a new property will be created in its place.  To add values
         to an existing property, use the append or merge commands.

         If values are included in the command, these values will be set for the
         given key.

         NOTE - Not all directory nodes support a property without a value. An
         error will be given if you attempt to create a property with no value in
         such a directory node.

       createpl
         Usage: createpl record_path key plist_path val1 [val2 ...]

         Creates a string, or array of strings at plist_path.

         If you are creating a value at the root of a plist that is an array,
         simply use "0" as the plist_path.

         Deletes a value in a plist.  If no values are given deletepl deletes the

         within plist_path.

         Deletes a value for the plist at value_index of the key.  If no values

         given, deletepli deletes the values within plist_path.

       passwd
         Usage: passwd user_path [new_password | old_password new_password]

         Changes a password for a user. The user must be specified by full path,
         not just a username.  If you are authenticated to the node (either by
         specifying the -u and -P flags or by using the auth command when in
         interactive node) then you can simply specify a new password.  If you are
         not authenticated or if FileVault is enabled then the user's old password
         must be specified.  If passwords are not specified while in interactive
         mode, you will be prompted for them.  Passing these passwords on the
         command line is inherently insecure and can cause password exposure.  For
         better security do not provide the password as part of the command and

    INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
       cd
         Usage: cd dir

         Sets the current directory.  Path names for other dscl commands may be
         relative to the current directory.

       pushd (pd)
         Usage: pushd path

         Similar to the pushd command commonly found in Unix shells.  When a path
         is specified it sets the current directory while pushing the previous
         directory on to the directory stack.  If no path is specified it
         exchanges the top two elements of the directory stack.  It will also
         print the final directory stack.

       popd
         Usage: popd

         Pops the directory stack and returns to the new top directory.  It will
         also print the final directory stack.

       auth (su)
         Usage: auth [user [password]]

         Authenticate as the named user, or as "root" if no user is specified.  If
         a password is supplied, then that password is used for authentication,
         otherwise the command prompts for a password.

         If dscl is run in host mode, then when this command is run the current
