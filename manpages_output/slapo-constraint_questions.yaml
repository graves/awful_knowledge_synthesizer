Attributes can have\n       multiple constraints placed upon them, and all must be satisfied when\n       modifying an attribute value under constraint.\n\n       This overlay is intended to be used to force syntactic regularity upon\n       certain string represented data which have well known canonical forms,\n       like telephone numbers, post codes, FQDNs, etc.\n\n       It constrains only LDAP add, modify and rename commands and only seeks\n       to control the add and replace values of modify and rename requests.\n\n       No constraints are applied for operations performed with the relax\n       control set.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       This slapd.conf option applies to the constraint overlay.  It should\n       appear after the overlay directive.\n\n       constraint_attribute <attribute_name>[,...] <type> <value> [<extra>\n       [...]] Specifies the constraint which should apply to the comma-\n\t      separated attribute list named as the first parameter.  Five\n\t      types of constraint are currently supported - regex, size,\n\t      count, uri, and set.\n\n\t      The parameter following the regex type is a Unix style regular\n\t      expression (See regex(7) ). The parameter following the uri type\n\t      is an LDAP URI. The URI will be evaluated using an internal\n\t      search.  It must not include a hostname, and it must include a\n\t      list of attributes to evaluate.\n\n\t      The parameter following the set type is a string that is\n\t      interpreted according to the syntax in use for ACL sets.\tThis\n\t      allows to construct constraints based on the contents of the\n\t      entry.\n\n\t      The size type can be used to enforce a limit on an attribute\n\t      length, and the count type limits the number of values of an\n\t      attribute.\n\n\t      Extra parameters can occur in any order after those described\n\t      above.\n\n\t      <extra> : restrict=<uri>\n\n\t      This extra parameter allows to restrict the application of the\n\t      corresponding constraint only to entries that match the base,\n\t      scope and filter portions of the LDAP URI.  The base, if\n\t      present, must be within the naming context of the database.  The\n\t      scope is only used when the base is present; it defaults to\n\t      base.  The other parameters of the URI are not allowed."

It would also\n       reject any title attribute whose values were not listed in the title\n       attribute of any titleCatalog entries in the given scope. (Note that\n       the \"dc=catalog,dc=example,dc=com\" subtree ought to reside in a\n       separate database, otherwise the initial set of titleCatalog entries\n       could not be populated while the constraint is in effect.)  Finally, it\n       requires the values of the attribute cn to be constructed by pairing\n       values of the attributes sn and givenName, separated by a space, but\n       only for entries derived from the objectClass inetOrgPerson."
