    NAME
           perlxstut - Tutorial for writing XSUBs

    DESCRIPTION
           This tutorial will educate the reader on the steps involved in creating
           a Perl extension.  The reader is assumed to have access to perlguts,
           perlapi and perlxs.

           This tutorial starts with very simple examples and becomes more
           complex, with each new example adding new features.  Certain concepts
           may not be completely explained until later in the tutorial in order to
           slowly ease the reader into building extensions.

           This tutorial was written from a Unix point of view.  Where I know them
           to be otherwise different for other platforms (e.g. Win32), I will list
           them.  If you find something that was missed, please let me know.

    SPECIAL NOTES
       make
           This tutorial assumes that the make program that Perl is configured to
           use is called "make".  Instead of running "make" in the examples that
           follow, you may have to substitute whatever make program Perl has been
           configured to use.  Running perl -V:make should tell you what it is.

    Version caveat
           When writing a Perl extension for general consumption, one should
           expect that the extension will be used with versions of Perl different
           from the version available on your machine.  Since you are reading this
           document, the version of Perl on your machine is probably 5.005 or
           later, but the users of your extension may have more ancient versions.

           To understand what kinds of incompatibilities one may expect, and in
           the rare case that the version of Perl on your machine is older than
           this document, see the section on "Troubleshooting these Examples" for
           more information.

           If your extension uses some features of Perl which are not available on
           older releases of Perl, your users would appreciate an early meaningful
           warning.  You would probably put this information into the README file,
           but nowadays installation of extensions may be performed automatically,
           guided by CPAN.pm module or other tools.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlxstut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIn MakeMaker-based installations, Makefile.PL provides the earliest\n       opportunity to perform version checks.  One can put something like this\n       in Makefile.PL for this purpose:\n\n\t   eval { require 5.007 }\n\t       or die <<EOD;\n\t   ############\n\t   ### This module uses frobnication framework which is not available\n\t   ### before version 5.007 of Perl.  Upgrade your Perl before\n\t   ### installing Kara::Mba.\n\t   ############\n\t   EOD\n\n   Dynamic Loading versus Static Loading\n       It is commonly thought that if a system does not have the capability to\n       dynamically load a library, you cannot build XSUBs.  This is incorrect.\n       You can build them, but you must link the XSUBs subroutines with the\n       rest of Perl, creating a new executable.  This situation is similar to\n       Perl 4.\n\n       This tutorial can still be used on such a system.  The XSUB build\n       mechanism will check the system and build a dynamically-loadable\n       library if possible, or else a static library and then, optionally, a\n       new statically-linked executable with that static library linked in.\n\n       Should you wish to build a statically-linked executable on a system\n       which can dynamically load libraries, you may, in all the following\n       examples, where the command \"\"make\"\" with no arguments is executed, run\n       the command \"\"make perl\"\" instead.\n\n       If you have generated such a statically-linked executable by choice,\n       then instead of saying \"\"make test\"\", you should say \"\"make\n       test_static\"\".  On systems that cannot build dynamically-loadable\n       libraries at all, simply saying \"\"make test\"\" is sufficient.\n\n   Threads and PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT\n       For threaded builds, perl requires the context pointer for the current\n       thread, without \"PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT\", perl will call a function to\n       retrieve the context.\n\n       For improved performance, include:\n\n\t #define PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT\n\n       as shown below.\n\n       For more details, see perlguts.\n\nTUTORIAL\n       Now let's go on with the show!\n\n   EXAMPLE 1\n       Our first extension will be very simple.  When we call the routine in\n       the extension, it will print out a well-known message and return.\n\n       Run \"\"h2xs -A -n Mytest\"\".  This creates a directory named Mytest,\n       possibly under ext/ if that directory exists in the current working\n       directory.  Several files will be created under the Mytest dir,\n       including MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, lib/Mytest.pm, Mytest.xs, t/Mytest.t,\n       and Changes.\n\n       The MANIFEST file contains the names of all the files just created in\n       the Mytest directory.\n\n       The file Makefile.PL should look something like this:\n\n\t   use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;\n\n\t   # See lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm for details of how to influence\n\t   # the contents of the Makefile that is written.\n\t   WriteMakefile(\n\t       NAME\t    => 'Mytest',\n\t       VERSION_FROM => 'Mytest.pm', # finds $VERSION\n\t       LIBS\t    => [''],\t    # e.g., '-lm'\n\t       DEFINE\t    => '',\t    # e.g., '-DHAVE_SOMETHING'\n\t       INC\t    => '-I',\t    # e.g., '-I. -I/usr/include/other'\n\t   );\n\n       The file Mytest.pm should start with something like this:\n\n\t   package Mytest;\n\n\t   use 5.008008;\n\t   use strict;\n\t   use warnings;\n\n\t   require Exporter;\n\n\t   our @ISA = qw(Exporter);\n\t   our %EXPORT_TAGS = ( 'all' => [ qw(\n\n\t   ) ] );\n\n\t   our @EXPORT_OK = ( @{ $EXPORT_TAGS{'all'} } );\n\n\t   our @EXPORT = qw(\n\n\t   );\n\n\t   our $VERSION = '0.01';\n\n\t   require XSLoader;\n\t   XSLoader::load('Mytest', $VERSION);\n\n\t   # Preloaded methods go here.\n\n\t   1;\n\t   __END__\n\t   # Below is the stub of documentation for your module. You better\n\t   # edit it!\n\n       The rest of the .pm file contains sample code for providing\n       documentation for the extension.\n\n       Finally, the Mytest.xs file should look something like this:\n\n\t   #define PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT\n\t   #include \"EXTERN.h\"\n\t   #include \"perl.h\"\n\t   #include \"XSUB.h\"\n\n\t   #include \"ppport.h\"\n\n\t   MODULE = Mytest\t       PACKAGE = Mytest\n\n       Let's edit the .xs file by adding this to the end of the file:\n\n\t   void\n\t   hello()\n\t       CODE:\n\t\t   printf(\"Hello, world!\\n\");\n\n       It is okay for the lines starting at the \"CODE:\" line to not be\n       indented.  However, for readability purposes, it is suggested that you\n       indent CODE: one level and the lines following one more level.\n\n       Now we'll run \"\"perl Makefile.PL\"\".  This will create a real Makefile,\n       which make needs.  Its output looks something like:\n\n\t   % perl Makefile.PL\n\t   Checking if your kit is complete...\n\t   Looks good\n\t   Writing Makefile for Mytest\n\t   %\n\n       Now, running make will produce output that looks something like this\n       (some long lines have been shortened for clarity and some extraneous\n       lines have been deleted):\n\n\t% make\n\tcp lib/Mytest.pm blib/lib/Mytest.pm\n\tperl xsubpp  -typemap typemap  Mytest.xs > Mytest.xsc && \\\n\tmv Mytest.xsc Mytest.c\n\tPlease specify prototyping behavior for Mytest.xs (see perlxs manual)\n\tcc -c\t  Mytest.c\n\tRunning Mkbootstrap for Mytest ()\n\tchmod 644 Mytest.bs\n\trm -f blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.so\n\tcc -shared -L/usr/local/lib Mytest.o -o blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.so\n\n\tchmod 755 blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.so\n\tcp Mytest.bs blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.bs\n\tchmod 644 blib/arch/auto/Mytest/Mytest.bs\n\tManifying blib/man3/Mytest.3pm\n\t%\n\n       You can safely ignore the line about \"prototyping behavior\" - it is\n       explained in \"The PROTOTYPES: Keyword\" in perlxs.\n\n       Perl has its own special way of easily writing test scripts, but for\n       this example only, we'll create our own test script.  Create a file\n       called hello that looks like this:\n\n\t   #! /opt/perl5/bin/perl\n\n\t   use ExtUtils::testlib;\n\n\t   use Mytest;\n\n\t   Mytest::hello();\n\n       Now we make the script executable (\"chmod +x hello\"), run the script\n       and we should see the following output:\n\n\t   % ./hello\n\t   Hello, world!\n\t   %\n\n   EXAMPLE 2\n       Now let's add to our extension a subroutine that will take a single\n       numeric argument as input and return 1 if the number is even or 0 if\n       the number is odd.\n\n       Add the following to the end of Mytest.xs:\n\n\t   int\n\t   is_even(input)\n\t\t   int input\n\t       CODE:\n\t\t   RETVAL = (input % 2 == 0);\n\t       OUTPUT:\n\t\t   RETVAL\n\n       There does not need to be whitespace at the start of the \"\"int input\"\"\n       line, but it is useful for improving readability.  Placing a semi-colon\n       at the end of that line is also optional.  Any amount and kind of\n       whitespace may be placed between the \"\"int\"\" and \"\"input\"\".\n\n       Now re-run make to rebuild our new shared library.\n\n       Now perform the same steps as before, generating a Makefile from the\n       Makefile.PL file, and running make.\n\n       In order to test that our extension works, we now need to look at the\n       file Mytest.t.  This file is set up to imitate the same kind of testing\n       structure that Perl itself has.\tWithin the test script, you perform a\n       number of tests to confirm the behavior of the extension, printing \"ok\"\n       when the test is correct, \"not ok\" when it is not.\n\n\t   use Test::More tests => 4;\n\t   BEGIN { use_ok('Mytest') };\n\n\t   #########################\n\n\t   # Insert your test code below, the Test::More module is use()ed here\n\t   # so read its man page ( perldoc Test::More ) for help writing this\n\t   # test script.\n\n\t   is( Mytest::is_even(0), 1 );\n\t   is( Mytest::is_even(1), 0 );\n\t   is( Mytest::is_even(2), 1 );\n\n       We will be calling the test script through the command \"\"make test\"\".\n       You should see output that looks something like this:\n\n\t%make test\n\tPERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/bin/perl \"-MExtUtils::Command::MM\" \"-e\"\n\t\"test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')\" t/*.t\n\tt/Mytest....ok\n\tAll tests successful.\n\tFiles=1, Tests=4, 0 wallclock secs ( 0.03 cusr + 0.00 csys = 0.03 CPU)\n\t%\n\n   What has gone on?\n       The program h2xs is the starting point for creating extensions.\tIn\n       later examples we'll see how we can use h2xs to read header files and\n       generate templates to connect to C routines.\n\n       h2xs creates a number of files in the extension directory.  The file\n       Makefile.PL is a perl script which will generate a true Makefile to\n       build the extension.  We'll take a closer look at it later.\n\n       The .pm and .xs files contain the meat of the extension.  The .xs file\n       holds the C routines that make up the extension.  The .pm file contains\n       routines that tell Perl how to load your extension.\n\n       Generating the Makefile and running \"make\" created a directory called\n       blib (which stands for \"build library\") in the current working\n       directory.  This directory will contain the shared library that we will\n       build.  Once we have tested it, we can install it into its final\n       location.\n\n       Invoking the test script via \"\"make test\"\" did something very\n       important.  It invoked perl with all those \"-I\" arguments so that it\n       could find the various files that are part of the extension.  It is\n       very important that while you are still testing extensions that you use\n       \"\"make test\"\".  If you try to run the test script all by itself, you\n       will get a fatal error.\tAnother reason it is important to use \"\"make\n       test\"\" to run your test script is that if you are testing an upgrade to\n       an already-existing version, using \"\"make test\"\" ensures that you will\n       test your new extension, not the already-existing version.\n\n       When Perl sees a \"use extension;\", it searches for a file with the same\n       name as the \"use\"'d extension that has a .pm suffix.  If that file\n       cannot be found, Perl dies with a fatal error.  The default search path\n       is contained in the @INC array.\n\n       In our case, Mytest.pm tells perl that it will need the Exporter and\n       Dynamic Loader extensions.  It then sets the @ISA and @EXPORT arrays\n       and the $VERSION scalar; finally it tells perl to bootstrap the module.\n       Perl will call its dynamic loader routine (if there is one) and load\n       the shared library.\n\n       The two arrays @ISA and @EXPORT are very important.  The @ISA array\n       contains a list of other packages in which to search for methods (or\n       subroutines) that do not exist in the current package.  This is usually\n       only important for object-oriented extensions (which we will talk about\n       much later), and so usually doesn't need to be modified.\n\n       The @EXPORT array tells Perl which of the extension's variables and\n       subroutines should be placed into the calling package's namespace.\n       Because you don't know if the user has already used your variable and\n       subroutine names, it's vitally important to carefully select what to\n       export.\tDo not export method or variable names by default without a\n       good reason.\n\n       As a general rule, if the module is trying to be object-oriented then\n       don't export anything.  If it's just a collection of functions and\n       variables, then you can export them via another array, called\n       @EXPORT_OK.  This array does not automatically place its subroutine and\n       variable names into the namespace unless the user specifically requests\n       that this be done.\n\n       See perlmod for more information.\n\n       The $VERSION variable is used to ensure that the .pm file and the\n       shared library are \"in sync\" with each other.  Any time you make\n       changes to the .pm or .xs files, you should increment the value of this\n       variable.\n\n   Writing good test scripts\n       The importance of writing good test scripts cannot be over-emphasized.\n       You should closely follow the \"ok/not ok\" style that Perl itself uses,\n       so that it is very easy and unambiguous to determine the outcome of\n       each test case.\tWhen you find and fix a bug, make sure you add a test\n       case for it.\n\n       By running \"\"make test\"\", you ensure that your Mytest.t script runs and\n       uses the correct version of your extension.  If you have many test\n       cases, save your test files in the \"t\" directory and use the suffix\n       \".t\".  When you run \"\"make test\"\", all of these test files will be\n       executed.\n\n   EXAMPLE 3\n       Our third extension will take one argument as its input, round off that\n       value, and set the argument to the rounded value.\n\n       Add the following to the end of Mytest.xs:\n\n\t       void\n\t       round(arg)\n\t\t       double  arg\n\t\t   CODE:\n\t\t       if (arg > 0.0) {\n\t\t\t       arg = floor(arg + 0.5);\n\t\t       } else if (arg < 0.0) {\n\t\t\t       arg = ceil(arg - 0.5);\n\t\t       } else {\n\t\t\t       arg = 0.0;\n\t\t       }\n\t\t   OUTPUT:\n\t\t       arg\n\n       Edit the Makefile.PL file so that the corresponding line looks like\n       this:\n\n\t       LIBS\t => ['-lm'],   # e.g., '-lm'\n\n       Generate the Makefile and run make.  Change the test number in Mytest.t\n       to \"9\" and add the following tests:\n\n\t       my $i;\n\n\t       $i = -1.5;\n\t       Mytest::round($i);\n\t       is( $i, -2.0, 'Rounding -1.5 to -2.0' );\n\n\t       $i = -1.1;\n\t       Mytest::round($i);\n\t       is( $i, -1.0, 'Rounding -1.1 to -1.0' );\n\n\t       $i = 0.0;\n\t       Mytest::round($i);\n\t       is( $i, 0.0, 'Rounding 0.0 to 0.0' );\n\n\t       $i = 0.5;\n\t       Mytest::round($i);\n\t       is( $i, 1.0, 'Rounding 0.5 to 1.0' );\n\n\t       $i = 1.2;\n\t       Mytest::round($i);\n\t       is( $i, 1.0, 'Rounding 1.2 to 1.0' );\n\n       Running \"\"make test\"\" should now print out that all nine tests are\n       okay.\n\n       Notice that in these new test cases, the argument passed to round was a\n       scalar variable.  You might be wondering if you can round a constant or\n       literal.  To see what happens, temporarily add the following line to\n       Mytest.t:\n\n\t       Mytest::round(3);\n\n       Run \"\"make test\"\" and notice that Perl dies with a fatal error.\tPerl\n       won't let you change the value of constants!\n\n   What's new here?\n       •   We've made some changes to Makefile.PL.  In this case, we've\n\t   specified an extra library to be linked into the extension's shared\n\t   library, the math library libm in this case.  We'll talk later\n\t   about how to write XSUBs that can call every routine in a library.\n\n       •   The value of the function is not being passed back as the\n\t   function's return value, but by changing the value of the variable\n\t   that was passed into the function.  You might have guessed that\n\t   when you saw that the return value of round is of type \"void\".\n\n   Input and Output Parameters\n       You specify the parameters that will be passed into the XSUB on the\n       line(s) after you declare the function's return value and name.\tEach\n       input parameter line starts with optional whitespace, and may have an\n       optional terminating semicolon.\n\n       The list of output parameters occurs at the very end of the function,\n       just after the OUTPUT: directive.  The use of RETVAL tells Perl that\n       you wish to send this value back as the return value of the XSUB\n       function.  In Example 3, we wanted the \"return value\" placed in the\n       original variable which we passed in, so we listed it (and not RETVAL)\n       in the OUTPUT: section.\n\n   The XSUBPP Program\n       The xsubpp program takes the XS code in the .xs file and translates it\n       into C code, placing it in a file whose suffix is .c.  The C code\n       created makes heavy use of the C functions within Perl.\n\n   The TYPEMAP file\n       The xsubpp program uses rules to convert from Perl's data types\n       (scalar, array, etc.) to C's data types (int, char, etc.).  These rules\n       are stored in the typemap file ($PERLLIB/ExtUtils/typemap).  There's a\n       brief discussion below, but all the nitty-gritty details can be found\n       in perlxstypemap.  If you have a new-enough version of perl (5.16 and\n       up) or an upgraded XS compiler (\"ExtUtils::ParseXS\" 3.13_01 or better),\n       then you can inline typemaps in your XS instead of writing separate\n       files.  Either way, this typemap thing is split into three parts:\n\n       The first section maps various C data types to a name, which\n       corresponds somewhat with the various Perl types.  The second section\n       contains C code which xsubpp uses to handle input parameters.  The\n       third section contains C code which xsubpp uses to handle output\n       parameters.\n\n       Let's take a look at a portion of the .c file created for our\n       extension.  The file name is Mytest.c:\n\n\t       XS(XS_Mytest_round)\n\t       {\n\t\t   dXSARGS;\n\t\t   if (items != 1)\n\t\t       Perl_croak(aTHX_ \"Usage: Mytest::round(arg)\");\n\t\t   PERL_UNUSED_VAR(cv); /* -W */\n\t\t   {\n\t\t       double  arg = (double)SvNV(ST(0));      /* XXXXX */\n\t\t       if (arg > 0.0) {\n\t\t\t       arg = floor(arg + 0.5);\n\t\t       } else if (arg < 0.0) {\n\t\t\t       arg = ceil(arg - 0.5);\n\t\t       } else {\n\t\t\t       arg = 0.0;\n\t\t       }\n\t\t       sv_setnv(ST(0), (double)arg);   /* XXXXX */\n\t\t       SvSETMAGIC(ST(0));\n\t\t   }\n\t\t   XSRETURN_EMPTY;\n\t       }\n\n       Notice the two lines commented with \"XXXXX\".  If you check the first\n       part of the typemap file (or section), you'll see that doubles are of\n       type T_DOUBLE.  In the INPUT part of the typemap, an argument that is\n       T_DOUBLE is assigned to the variable arg by calling the routine SvNV on\n       something, then casting it to double, then assigned to the variable\n       arg.  Similarly, in the OUTPUT section, once arg has its final value,\n       it is passed to the sv_setnv function to be passed back to the calling\n       subroutine.  These two functions are explained in perlguts; we'll talk\n       more later about what that \"ST(0)\" means in the section on the argument\n       stack.\n\n   Warning about Output Arguments\n       In general, it's not a good idea to write extensions that modify their\n       input parameters, as in Example 3.  Instead, you should probably return\n       multiple values in an array and let the caller handle them (we'll do\n       this in a later example).  However, in order to better accommodate\n       calling pre-existing C routines, which often do modify their input\n       parameters, this behavior is tolerated.\n\n   EXAMPLE 4\n       In this example, we'll now begin to write XSUBs that will interact with\n       pre-defined C libraries.  To begin with, we will build a small library\n       of our own, then let h2xs write our .pm and .xs files for us.\n\n       Create a new directory called Mytest2 at the same level as the\n       directory Mytest.  In the Mytest2 directory, create another directory\n       called mylib, and cd into that directory.\n\n       Here we'll create some files that will generate a test library.\tThese\n       will include a C source file and a header file.\tWe'll also create a\n       Makefile.PL in this directory.  Then we'll make sure that running make\n       at the Mytest2 level will automatically run this Makefile.PL file and\n       the resulting Makefile.\n\n       In the mylib directory, create a file mylib.h that looks like this:\n\n\t       #define TESTVAL 4\n\n\t       extern double   foo(int, long, const char*);\n\n       Also create a file mylib.c that looks like this:\n\n\t       #include <stdlib.h>\n\t       #include \"mylib.h\"\n\n\t       double\n\t       foo(int a, long b, const char *c)\n\t       {\n\t\t       return (a + b + atof(c) + TESTVAL);\n\t       }\n\n       And finally create a file Makefile.PL that looks like this:\n\n\t       use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;\n\t       $Verbose = 1;\n\t       WriteMakefile(\n\t\t   NAME  => 'Mytest2::mylib',\n\t\t   SKIP  => [qw(all static static_lib dynamic dynamic_lib)],\n\t\t   clean => {'FILES' => 'libmylib$(LIB_EXT)'},\n\t       );"

    Anything before this line is plain C code which describes which headers
           to include, and defines some convenience functions.  No translations
           are performed on this part, apart from having embedded POD
           documentation skipped over (see perlpod) it goes into the generated
           output C file as is.

           Anything after this line is the description of XSUB functions.  These
           descriptions are translated by xsubpp into C code which implements
           these functions using Perl calling conventions, and which makes these
           functions visible from Perl interpreter.

           Pay a special attention to the function "constant".  This name appears
           twice in the generated .xs file: once in the first part, as a static C
           function, then another time in the second part, when an XSUB interface
           to this static C function is defined.

           This is quite typical for .xs files: usually the .xs file provides an
           interface to an existing C function.  Then this C function is defined
           somewhere (either in an external library, or in the first part of .xs
           file), and a Perl interface to this function (i.e. "Perl glue") is
           described in the second part of .xs file.  The situation in "EXAMPLE
           1", "EXAMPLE 2", and "EXAMPLE 3", when all the work is done inside the

    More about XSUB arguments
           With the completion of Example 4, we now have an easy way to simulate
           some real-life libraries whose interfaces may not be the cleanest in
           the world.  We shall now continue with a discussion of the arguments
           passed to the xsubpp compiler.

           When you specify arguments to routines in the .xs file, you are really
           passing three pieces of information for each argument listed.  The
           first piece is the order of that argument relative to the others
           (first, second, etc).  The second is the type of argument, and consists
           of the type declaration of the argument (e.g., int, char*, etc).  The
           third piece is the calling convention for the argument in the call to
           the library function.

           While Perl passes arguments to functions by reference, C passes
           arguments by value; to implement a C function which modifies data of
           one of the "arguments", the actual argument of this C function would be
           a pointer to the data.  Thus two C functions with declarations

    XSUBs are also allowed to return lists, not just scalars.  This must be
           done by manipulating stack values ST(0), ST(1), etc, in a subtly
           different way.  See perlxs for details.

           XSUBs are also allowed to avoid automatic conversion of Perl function
           arguments to C function arguments.  See perlxs for details.  Some
           people prefer manual conversion by inspecting ST(i) even in the cases
           when automatic conversion will do, arguing that this makes the logic of
           an XSUB call clearer.  Compare with "Getting the fat out of XSUBs" for
           a similar tradeoff of a complete separation of "Perl glue" and
           "workhorse" parts of an XSUB.

           While experts may argue about these idioms, a novice to Perl guts may
           prefer a way which is as little Perl-guts-specific as possible, meaning
           automatic conversion and automatic call generation, as in "Getting the
           fat out of XSUBs".  This approach has the additional benefit of
           protecting the XSUB writer from future changes to the Perl API.

    Extending your Extension
           Sometimes you might want to provide some extra methods or subroutines
           to assist in making the interface between Perl and your extension
           simpler or easier to understand.  These routines should live in the .pm
           file.  Whether they are automatically loaded when the extension itself
           is loaded or only loaded when called depends on where in the .pm file
           the subroutine definition is placed.  You can also consult AutoLoader
           for an alternate way to store and load your extra subroutines.

       Documenting your Extension
           There is absolutely no excuse for not documenting your extension.
           Documentation belongs in the .pm file.  This file will be fed to
           pod2man, and the embedded documentation will be converted to the
           manpage format, then placed in the blib directory.  It will be copied
           to Perl's manpage directory when the extension is installed.

           You may intersperse documentation and Perl code within the .pm file.
           In fact, if you want to use method autoloading, you must do this, as
           the comment inside the .pm file explains.

    Manpage text:

    The standard typemap does not contain PerlIO * before perl 5.7, but it
           has the three stream variants. Using a PerlIO * directly is not
           backwards compatible unless you provide your own typemap.

           For streams coming from perl the main difference is that "OutputStream"
           will get the output PerlIO * - which may make a difference on a socket.
           Like in our example...

           For streams being handed to perl a new file handle is created (i.e. a
           reference to a new glob) and associated with the PerlIO * provided. If
           the read/write state of the PerlIO * is not correct then you may get
           errors or warnings from when the file handle is used.  So if you opened
           the PerlIO * as "w" it should really be an "OutputStream" if open as
           "r" it should be an "InputStream".

           Now, suppose you want to use perlio layers in your XS. We'll use the

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlxstut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n#define OutputStream    PerlIO *\n\t   or\n\t       typedef PerlIO *        OutputStream;\n\n       And this is the XS code:\n\n\t       int\n\t       perlioputs(s, stream)\n\t\t       char *\t       s\n\t\t       OutputStream    stream\n\t       CODE:\n\t\t       RETVAL = PerlIO_puts(stream, s);\n\t       OUTPUT:\n\t\t       RETVAL\n\n       We have to use a \"CODE\" section because \"PerlIO_puts()\" has the\n       arguments reversed compared to \"fputs()\", and we want to keep the\n       arguments the same.\n\n       Wanting to explore this thoroughly, we want to use the stdio \"fputs()\"\n       on a PerlIO *. This means we have to ask the perlio system for a stdio\n       \"FILE *\":\n\n\t       int\n\t       perliofputs(s, stream)\n\t\t       char *\t       s\n\t\t       OutputStream    stream\n\t       PREINIT:\n\t\t       FILE *fp = PerlIO_findFILE(stream);\n\t       CODE:\n\t\t       if (fp != (FILE*) 0) {\n\t\t\t       RETVAL = fputs(s, fp);\n\t\t       } else {\n\t\t\t       RETVAL = -1;\n\t\t       }\n\t       OUTPUT:\n\t\t       RETVAL\n\n       Note: \"PerlIO_findFILE()\" will search the layers for a stdio layer. If\n       it can't find one, it will call \"PerlIO_exportFILE()\" to generate a new\n       stdio \"FILE\". Please only call \"PerlIO_exportFILE()\" if you want a new\n       \"FILE\". It will generate one on each call and push a new stdio layer.\n       So don't call it repeatedly on the same file. \"PerlIO_findFILE()\" will\n       retrieve the stdio layer once it has been generated by\n       \"PerlIO_exportFILE()\"."

For versions before 5.7,\n       \"PerlIO_exportFILE()\" is equivalent to \"PerlIO_findFILE()\".\n\n   Troubleshooting these Examples\n       As mentioned at the top of this document, if you are having problems\n       with these example extensions, you might see if any of these help you.\n\n       •   In versions of 5.002 prior to the gamma version, the test script in\n\t   Example 1 will not function properly.  You need to change the \"use\n\t   lib\" line to read:\n\n\t\t   use lib './blib';\n\n       •   In versions of 5.002 prior to version 5.002b1h, the test.pl file\n\t   was not automatically created by h2xs.  This means that you cannot\n\t   say \"make test\" to run the test script.  You will need to add the\n\t   following line before the \"use extension\" statement:\n\n\t\t   use lib './blib';\n\n       •   In versions 5.000 and 5.001, instead of using the above line, you\n\t   will need to use the following line:\n\n\t\t   BEGIN { unshift(@INC, \"./blib\") }\n\n       •   This document assumes that the executable named \"perl\" is Perl\n\t   version 5.
