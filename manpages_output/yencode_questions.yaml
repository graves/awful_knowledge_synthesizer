This is a recently introduced method of encoding binary files\n       for transmission through Usenet. This encoding packs binary data into a\n       format that requires an 8-bit clean transmission layer but that escapes\n       characters special to the NNTP posting protocols. See\n       http://www.yenc.org/ for details concerning the algorithm.\n\n       ::yencode::encode string\n\t      returns the yEnc encoded data.\n\n       ::yencode::decode string\n\t      Decodes the given yEnc encoded data.\n\n       ::yencode::yencode ?-name string? ?-line integer? ?-crc32 boolean?\n       (-file filename | ?--? string)\n\t      Encode a file or block of data.\n\n       ::yencode::ydecode (-file filename | ?--? string)\n\t      Decode a file or block of data. A file may contain more than one\n\t      embedded file so the result is a list where each element is a\n\t      three element list of filename, file size and data.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -filename name\n\t      Cause the yencode or ydecode commands to read their data from\n\t      the named file rather that taking a string parameter.\n\n       -name string\n\t      The encoded data header line contains the suggested file name to\n\t      be used when unpacking the data. Use this option to change this\n\t      from the default of \"data.dat\".\n\n       -line integer\n\t      The yencoded data header line contains records the line length\n\t      used during the encoding. Use this option to select a line\n\t      length other that the default of 128. Note that NNTP imposes a\n\t      1000 character line length limit and some gateways may have\n\t      trouble with more than 255 characters per line.\n\n       -crc32 boolean\n\t      The yEnc specification recommends the inclusion of a cyclic\n\t      redundancy check value in the footer. Use this option to change\n\t      the default from true to false."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the yencode tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use yencode to encode a binary file named 'data.bin' into yEnc format with a custom filename 'myfile.txt' and line length of 256?
  manpageQuestion3: What command would you use to decode a yEnc encoded string that contains multiple embedded files, extracting their filenames, sizes, and data?
