The SPD (Security Policy Database) in the kernel usually triggers\n     racoon.  racoon usually sends all informational messages, warnings and\n     error messages to syslogd(8) with the facility LOG_DAEMON and the\n     priority LOG_INFO.  Debugging messages are sent with the priority\n     LOG_DEBUG.  You should configure syslog.conf(5) appropriately to see\n     these messages."
