Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `ppdmerge`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nppdmerge(1)\t\t\t  Apple Inc.\t\t\t   ppdmerge(1)\n\nNAME\n       ppdmerge - merge ppd files (deprecated)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       ppdmerge [ -o output-ppd-file ] ppd-file ppd-file [ ...\tppd-file ]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       ppdmerge merges two or more PPD files into a single, multi-language PPD\n       file.  This program is deprecated and will be removed in a future\n       release of CUPS.\n\nOPTIONS\n       ppdmerge supports the following options:\n\n       -o output-ppd-file\n\t      Specifies the PPD file to create.  If not specified, the merged\n\t      PPD file is written to the standard output.  If the output file\n\t      already exists, it is silently overwritten.\n\nNOTES\n       PPD files are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a future\n       feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP can be\n       supported using applications such as ippeveprinter(1).\n\n       ppdmerge does not check whether the merged PPD files are for the same\n       device.\tMerging of different device PPDs will yield unpredictable\n       results."
