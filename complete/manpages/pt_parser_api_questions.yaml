Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This document describes the API shared by the grammar interpreter\n       provided by the package pt::peg::interp and the parsers generated by\n       the pt application for the result formats critcl, snit, and oo\n       regarding access to the actual parsing functionality.\n\n       Its intended audience are people who wish to create a parser for some\n       language of theirs and then use that parser within a Tcl-based package\n       or application.\n\n       It resides in the User Layer of Parser Tools.\n\n       IMAGE: arch_user_pkg\n\nCLASS API\n       className ?objectName?\n\t      The class command constructs parser instances, i.e. objects. The\n\t      result of the command is the fully-qualified name of the\n\t      instance command.\n\n\t      If no objectName is specified the class will generate and use an\n\t      automatic name. If the objectName was specified, but is not\n\t      fully qualified the command will be created in the curent\n\t      namespace.\n\nINSTANCE API\n       All parser instances provide at least the methods shown below:\n\n       objectName destroy\n\t      This method destroys the parser instance, releasing all claimed\n\t      memory and other resources, and deleting the instance command.\n\n\t      The result of the command is the empty string.\n\n       objectName parse chan\n\t      This method runs the parser using the contents of chan as input\n\t      (starting at the current location in the channel), until parsing\n\t      is not possible anymore, either because parsing has completed,\n\t      or run into a syntax error.\n\n\t      Note here that the Parser Tools are based on Tcl 8.5+. In other\n\t      words, the channel argument is not restricted to files, sockets,\n\t      etc. We have the full power of reflected channels available.\n\n\t      It should also be noted that the parser pulls the characters\n\t      from the input stream as it needs them. If a parser created by\n\t      this package has to be operated in a push aka event-driven\n\t      manner it will be necessary to go to Tcl 8.6+ and use the\n\t      coroutine::auto to wrap it into a coroutine where read is\n\t      properly changed for push-operation.\n\n\t      Upon successful completion the command returns an abstract\n\t      syntax tree as its result.  This AST is in the form specified in\n\t      section AST serialization format.  As a plain nested Tcl-list it\n\t      can then be processed with any Tcl commands the user likes,\n\t      doing transformations, semantic checks, etc.  To help in this\n\t      the package pt::ast provides a set of convenience commands for\n\t      validation of the tree's basic structure, printing it for\n\t      debugging, and walking it either from the bottom up, or top\n\t      down.\n\n\t      When encountering a syntax error the command will throw an error\n\t      instead.\tThis error will be a 4-element Tcl-list, containing,\n\t      in the order listed below:\n\n\t      [1]    The string pt::rde identifying it as parser runtime\n\t\t     error.\n\n\t      [2]    The location of the parse error, as character offset from\n\t\t     the beginning of the parsed input.\n\n\t      [3]    The location of parse error, now as a 2-element list\n\t\t     containing line-number and column in the line.\n\n\t      [4]    A set of atomic parsing expressions indicating encoding\n\t\t     the characters and/or nonterminal symbols the parser\n\t\t     expected to see at the location of the parse error, but\n\t\t     did not get.  For the specification of atomic parsing\n\t\t     expressions please see the section PE serialization\n\t\t     format.\n\n       objectName parset text\n\t      This method runs the parser using the string in text as input.\n\t      In all other ways it behaves like the method parse, shown above.\n\nUSAGE\n       A generated parser is used like this\n\n\t   package require the-parser-package ;# Generated by result-formats 'critcl', 'snit' or 'oo' of 'pt'.\n\t   set parser [the-parser-class]\n\n\t   set ast [$parser parse $channel]\n\t   ... process the abstract syntax tree ...\n\n       When using a grammar interpreter for parsing some differences creep in\n\n\t   package require the-grammar-package ;# Generated by result-format 'container' of 'pt'.\n\t   set grammar [the-grammar-class]\n\n\t   package require pt::peg::interp\n\t   set parser [pt::peg::interp]\n\n\t   $parser use $grammar\n\n\t   set ast [$parser parse $channel]\n\t   $parser destroy\n\n\t   ... process the abstract syntax tree ..."

ASTs do not\n       contain terminal symbols, i.e. tokens/characters. These can be\n       recovered from the input given a symbol's location.\n\n       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a\n       tree may have more than one regular serialization only exactly one of\n       them will be canonical.\n\n       Regular serialization\n\n\t      [1]    The serialization of any AST is the serialization of its\n\t\t     root node.\n\n\t      [2]    The serialization of any node is a Tcl list containing at\n\t\t     least three elements.\n\n\t\t     [1]    The first element is the name of the nonterminal\n\t\t\t    symbol stored in the node.\n\n\t\t     [2]    The second and third element are the locations of\n\t\t\t    the first and last token in the token stream the\n\t\t\t    node represents (covers).\n\n\t\t\t    [1]    Locations are provided as non-negative\n\t\t\t\t   integer offsets from the beginning of the\n\t\t\t\t   token stream, with the first token found in\n\t\t\t\t   the stream located at offset 0 (zero).\n\n\t\t\t    [2]    The end location has to be equal to or\n\t\t\t\t   larger than the start location.\n\n\t\t     [3]    All elements after the first three represent the\n\t\t\t    children of the node, which are themselves nodes.\n\t\t\t    This means that the serializations of nodes\n\t\t\t    without children, i.e. leaf nodes, have exactly\n\t\t\t    three elements.  The children are stored in the\n\t\t\t    list with the leftmost child first, and the\n\t\t\t    rightmost child last.\n\n       Canonical serialization\n\t      The canonical serialization of an abstract syntax tree has the\n\t      format as specified in the previous item, and then additionally\n\t      satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique among all\n\t      the possible serializations of this tree.\n\n\t      [1]    The string representation of the value is the canonical\n\t\t     representation of a pure Tcl list.
