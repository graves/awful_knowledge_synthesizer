This is because (on Unix machines) tcl_platform\n       reflects the values returned by the uname command and these are not\n       standardized across platforms and architectures. In addition, on at\n       least one platform (AIX) the tcl_platform(machine) contains the CPU\n       serial number."

The returned identifier has the general\n\t      format OS-CPU. The OS part of the identifier may contain details\n\t      like kernel version, libc version, etc., and this information\n\t      may contain dashes as well.  The CPU part will not contain\n\t      dashes, making the preceding dash the last dash in the result."
