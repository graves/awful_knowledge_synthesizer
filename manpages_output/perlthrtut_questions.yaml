In this model, each thread runs in its own\n       Perl interpreter, and any data sharing between threads must be\n       explicit.  The user-level interface for ithreads uses the threads\n       class.\n\n       NOTE: There was another older Perl threading flavor called the 5.005\n       model that used the threads class.  This old model was known to have\n       problems, is deprecated, and was removed for release 5.10.  You are\n       strongly encouraged to migrate any existing 5.005 threads code to the\n       new model as soon as possible.\n\n       You can see which (or neither) threading flavour you have by running\n       \"perl -V\" and looking at the \"Platform\" section.  If you have\n       \"useithreads=define\" you have ithreads, if you have\n       \"use5005threads=define\" you have 5.005 threads.\tIf you have neither,\n       you don't have any thread support built in.  If you have both, you are\n       in trouble."

    This model is common in GUI and server programs, where a main thread
           waits for some event and then passes that event to the appropriate
           worker threads for processing.  Once the event has been passed on, the
           boss thread goes back to waiting for another event.

           The boss thread does relatively little work.  While tasks aren't
           necessarily performed faster than with any other method, it tends to
           have the best user-response times.

       Work Crew
           In the work crew model, several threads are created that do essentially
           the same thing to different pieces of data.  It closely mirrors
           classical parallel processing and vector processors, where a large
           array of processors do the exact same thing to many pieces of data.

           This model is particularly useful if the system running the program
           will distribute multiple threads across different processors.  It can
           also be useful in ray tracing or rendering engines, where the
           individual threads can pass on interim results to give the user visual
           feedback.

    What kind of threads are Perl threads?
           If you have experience with other thread implementations, you might
           find that things aren't quite what you expect.  It's very important to
           remember when dealing with Perl threads that Perl Threads Are Not X
           Threads for all values of X.  They aren't POSIX threads, or DecThreads,
           or Java's Green threads, or Win32 threads.  There are similarities, and
           the broad concepts are the same, but if you start looking for
           implementation details you're going to be either disappointed or
           confused.  Possibly both.

           This is not to say that Perl threads are completely different from
           everything that's ever come before. They're not.  Perl's threading
           model owes a lot to other thread models, especially POSIX.  Just as
           Perl is not C, though, Perl threads are not POSIX threads.  So if you
           find yourself looking for mutexes, or thread priorities, it's time to
           step back a bit and think about what you want to do and how Perl can do
           it.

    Even if a module is thread-safe, it doesn't mean that the module is
           optimized to work well with threads. A module could possibly be
           rewritten to utilize the new features in threaded Perl to increase
           performance in a threaded environment.

           If you're using a module that's not thread-safe for some reason, you
           can protect yourself by using it from one, and only one thread at all.
           If you need multiple threads to access such a module, you can use
           semaphores and lots of programming discipline to control access to it.
           Semaphores are covered in "Basic semaphores".

It's something that's\n       turned on or off when Perl is built at your site, rather than when your\n       programs are compiled. If your Perl wasn't compiled with thread support\n       enabled, then any attempt to use threads will fail.\n\n       Your programs can use the Config module to check whether threads are\n       enabled. If your program can't run without them, you can say something\n       like:\n\n\t   use Config;\n\t   $Config{useithreads} or\n\t       die('Recompile Perl with threads to run this program.');\n\n       A possibly-threaded program using a possibly-threaded module might have\n       code like this:\n\n\t   use Config;\n\t   use MyMod;\n\n\t   BEGIN {\n\t       if ($Config{useithreads}) {\n\t\t   # We have threads\n\t\t   require MyMod_threaded;\n\t\t   import MyMod_threaded;\n\t       } else {\n\t\t   require MyMod_unthreaded;\n\t\t   import MyMod_unthreaded;\n\t       }\n\t   }\n\n       Since code that runs both with and without threads is usually pretty\n       messy, it's best to isolate the thread-specific code in its own module.\n       In our example above, that's what \"MyMod_threaded\" is, and it's only\n       imported if we're running on a threaded Perl."

    Two threads both access $x.  Each thread can potentially be interrupted
           at any point, or be executed in any order.  At the end, $x could be 3
           or 4, and both $y and $z could be 2 or 3.

           Even "$x += 5" or "$x++" are not guaranteed to be atomic.

           Whenever your program accesses data or resources that can be accessed
           by other threads, you must take steps to coordinate access or risk data
           inconsistency and race conditions. Note that Perl will protect its
           internals from your race conditions, but it won't protect you from you.

    Synchronization and control
           Perl provides a number of mechanisms to coordinate the interactions
           between themselves and their data, to avoid race conditions and the
           like.  Some of these are designed to resemble the common techniques
           used in thread libraries such as "pthreads"; others are Perl-specific.
           Often, the standard techniques are clumsy and difficult to get right
           (such as condition waits). Where possible, it is usually easier to use
           Perlish techniques such as queues, which remove some of the hard work
           involved.

    For example, let's take a GUI driven program.  It has a semaphore that
           it uses to synchronize access to the display, so only one thread is
           ever drawing at once.  Handy, but of course you don't want any thread
           to start drawing until things are properly set up.  In this case, you
           can create a semaphore with a counter set to zero, and up it when
           things are ready for drawing.

           Semaphores with counters greater than one are also useful for
           establishing quotas.  Say, for example, that you have a number of
           threads that can do I/O at once.  You don't want all the threads
           reading or writing at once though, since that can potentially swamp
           your I/O channels, or deplete your process's quota of filehandles.  You
           can use a semaphore initialized to the number of concurrent I/O
           requests (or open files) that you want at any one time, and have your
           threads quietly block and unblock themselves.

           Larger increments or decrements are handy in those cases where a thread

           thread that's created.  When used as a class method, "threads->tid()"
           can be used by a thread to get its own TID.

       Are These Threads The Same?
           The "equal()" method takes two thread objects and returns true if the
           objects represent the same thread, and false if they don't.

           Thread objects also have an overloaded "==" comparison so that you can
           do comparison on them as you would with normal objects.

       What Threads Are Running?
           "threads->list()" returns a list of thread objects, one for each thread
           that's currently running and not detached.  Handy for a number of
           things, including cleaning up at the end of your program (from the main
           Perl thread, of course):

    Manpage text:

    The while loop from line 14 to line 26 grabs a scalar off the input
           queue and checks against the prime this thread is responsible for.
           Line 15 checks to see if there's a remainder when we divide the number
           to be checked by our prime.  If there is one, the number must not be
           evenly divisible by our prime, so we need to either pass it on to the
           next thread if we've created one (line 17) or create a new thread if we
           haven't.

           The new thread creation is line 20.  We pass on to it a reference to
           the queue we've created, and the prime number we've found.  In lines 21
           through 24, we check to make sure that our new thread got created, and
           if not, we stop checking any remaining numbers in the queue.

           Finally, once the loop terminates (because we got a 0 or "undef" in the
           queue, which serves as a note to terminate), we pass on the notice to
           our child, and wait for it to exit if we've created a child (lines 27
           and 30).

    Meanwhile, back in the main thread, we first create a queue (line 33)
           and queue up all the numbers from 3 to 1000 for checking, plus a

           pass the queue and the first prime to the "check_num()" subroutine
           (line 34).

           That's how it works.  It's pretty simple; as with many Perl programs,

    Different implementations of threads
           Some background on thread implementations from the operating system
           viewpoint.  There are three basic categories of threads: user-mode
           threads, kernel threads, and multiprocessor kernel threads.

           User-mode threads are threads that live entirely within a program and
           its libraries.  In this model, the OS knows nothing about threads.  As
           far as it's concerned, your process is just a process.

           This is the easiest way to implement threads, and the way most OSes
           start.  The big disadvantage is that, since the OS knows nothing about
           threads, if one thread blocks they all do.  Typical blocking activities
           include most system calls, most I/O, and things like "sleep()".

The OS knows\n       about kernel threads, and makes allowances for them.  The main\n       difference between a kernel thread and a user-mode thread is blocking.\n       With kernel threads, things that block a single thread don't block\n       other threads.  This is not the case with user-mode threads, where the\n       kernel blocks at the process level and not the thread level.\n\n       This is a big step forward, and can give a threaded program quite a\n       performance boost over non-threaded programs.

    Manpage text:

    Multiprocessor kernel threads are the final step in thread support.
           With multiprocessor kernel threads on a machine with multiple CPUs, the
           OS may schedule two or more threads to run simultaneously on different
           CPUs.

           This can give a serious performance boost to your threaded program,
           since more than one thread will be executing at the same time.  As a
           tradeoff, though, any of those nagging synchronization issues that
           might not have shown with basic kernel threads will appear with a
           vengeance.

           In addition to the different levels of OS involvement in threads,
           different OSes (and different thread implementations for a particular
           OS) allocate CPU cycles to threads in different ways.

           Cooperative multitasking systems have running threads give up control
           if one of two things happen.  If a thread calls a yield function, it
           gives up control.  It also gives up control if the thread does
           something that would cause it to block, such as perform I/O.  In a
           cooperative multitasking implementation, one thread can starve all the
           others for CPU time if it so chooses.

    Manpage text:

    Preemptive multitasking systems interrupt threads at regular intervals
           while the system decides which thread should run next.  In a preemptive
           multitasking system, one thread usually won't monopolize the CPU.

           On some systems, there can be cooperative and preemptive threads
           running simultaneously. (Threads running with realtime priorities often
           behave cooperatively, for example, while threads running at normal
           priorities behave preemptively.)

           Most modern operating systems support preemptive multitasking nowadays.

    Performance considerations
           The main thing to bear in mind when comparing Perl's ithreads to other
           threading models is the fact that for each new thread created, a
           complete copy of all the variables and data of the parent thread has to
           be taken. Thus, thread creation can be quite expensive, both in terms
           of memory usage and time spent in creation. The ideal way to reduce
           these costs is to have a relatively short number of long-lived threads,
           all created fairly early on (before the base thread has accumulated too
           much data). Of course, this may not always be possible, so compromises
           have to be made. However, after a thread has been created, its
           performance and extra memory usage should be little different than
           ordinary code.

    Also note that under the current implementation, shared variables use a
           little more memory and are a little slower than ordinary variables.

    Process-scope Changes
           Note that while threads themselves are separate execution threads and
           Perl data is thread-private unless explicitly shared, the threads can
           affect process-scope state, affecting all the threads.

           The most common example of this is changing the current working
           directory using "chdir()".  One thread calls "chdir()", and the working
           directory of all the threads changes.

           Even more drastic example of a process-scope change is "chroot()": the
           root directory of all the threads changes, and no thread can undo it
           (as opposed to "chdir()").

           Further examples of process-scope changes include "umask()" and
           changing uids and gids.

           Thinking of mixing "fork()" and threads?  Please lie down and wait
           until the feeling passes.  Be aware that the semantics of "fork()" vary
           between platforms.  For example, some Unix systems copy all the current
           threads into the child process, while others only copy the thread that
           called "fork()". You have been warned!

    Similarly, mixing signals and threads may be problematic.
           Implementations are platform-dependent, and even the POSIX semantics
           may not be what you expect (and Perl doesn't even give you the full
           POSIX API).  For example, there is no way to guarantee that a signal
           sent to a multi-threaded Perl application will get intercepted by any
           particular thread.  (However, a recently added feature does provide the
           capability to send signals between threads.  See "THREAD SIGNALLING" in
           threads for more details.)

    Thread-Safety of System Libraries
           Whether various library calls are thread-safe is outside the control of
           Perl.  Calls often suffering from not being thread-safe include:
           "localtime()", "gmtime()",  functions fetching user, group and network
           information (such as "getgrent()", "gethostent()", "getnetent()" and so
           on), "readdir()", "rand()", and "srand()". In general, calls that
           depend on some global external state.

    Manpage text:

    If the system Perl is compiled in has thread-safe variants of such
           calls, they will be used.  Beyond that, Perl is at the mercy of the
           thread-safety or -unsafety of the calls.  Please consult your C library
           call documentation.

           On some platforms the thread-safe library interfaces may fail if the
           result buffer is too small (for example the user group databases may be
           rather large, and the reentrant interfaces may have to carry around a
           full snapshot of those databases).  Perl will start with a small
           buffer, but keep retrying and growing the result buffer until the
           result fits.  If this limitless growing sounds bad for security or
           memory consumption reasons you can recompile Perl with
           "PERL_REENTRANT_MAXSIZE" defined to the maximum number of bytes you
           will allow.
