It is ignored for regular\n     files.  See chmod(2) or the file <sys/stat.h> for an explanation of file\n     modes.\n\nSTICKY DIRECTORIES\n     A directory whose `sticky bit' is set becomes an append-only directory,\n     or, more accurately, a directory in which the deletion of files is\n     restricted.  A file in a sticky directory may only be removed or renamed\n     by a user if the user has write permission for the directory and the user\n     is the owner of the file, the owner of the directory, or the super-user.\n     This feature is usefully applied to directories such as /tmp which must\n     be publicly writable but should deny users the license to arbitrarily\n     delete or rename each others' files.\n\n     Any user may create a sticky directory.  See chmod(1) for details about\n     modifying file modes."
