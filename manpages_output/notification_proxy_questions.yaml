- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `notification_proxy`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nnotification_proxy(8)\t    System Manager's Manual\t notification_proxy(8)\n\nNAME\n     notification_proxy â€“ notification server\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     notification_proxy\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     notification_proxy enables a trusted remote Mac to read/write\n     notifications on this Mac.  Trust requires that this Mac explicitly pair\n     with the remote Mac.  The daemon is started automatically by launchd upon\n     the trusted Mac requesting a connection to this service.\n\n     This daemon also allows an untrusted remote Mac to read/write\n     notifications while this Mac is still in setup. Once this Mac exits\n     device setup, trust is required.\n\n     This command is not intended to be invoked directly.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     notify(3).\n\nMac OS X\t\t\tMarch 25, 2021\t\t\t      Mac OS X"
