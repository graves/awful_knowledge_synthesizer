It does this by opening an AgentX subagent\n       connection to the master snmpd agent and registering the notification\n       log tables.  As long as the snmpd application is started first, it will\n       attach itself to it and thus you should be able to view the last\n       recorded notifications via the nlmLogTable and nlmLogVariableTable.\n       See the snmptrapd.conf file and the \"doNotRetainNotificationLogs\" token\n       for turning off this support.
