The following information is shown for each loaded kext:\n\n     Index     The load index of the kext (used to track linkage references).\n\t       Gaps in the list indicate kexts that have been unloaded.\n\n     Refs      The number of references to this kext by others.  If nonzero,\n\t       the kext cannot be unloaded.\n\n     Address   The address in kernel space where the kext has been loaded.\n\n     Size      The number of bytes of kernel memory that the kext occupies.\n\t       If this is zero, the kext is a built-in part of the kernel that\n\t       has a record as a kext for resolving dependencies among kexts."

  manpageQuestion2: How can you use kextstat to list all currently loaded kernel extensions along with their load index and reference count?
  manpageQuestion3: What command would you use to check the status of a specific kernel extension identified by the bundle identifier 'com.example.mykext'?
