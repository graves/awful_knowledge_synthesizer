One\n\t      example is the aforementioned pt::pgen which provides a parser\n\t      generator.\n\n\t      The list of packages belonging to this layer can be found in\n\t      section User Packages\n\n       [2]    In this layer we have the packages which provide the core of the\n\t      functionality for the whole system. They are, in essence, a set\n\t      of blocks which can be combined in myriad ways, like Lego (tm).\n\t      The packages in the previous level are 'just' pre-fabricated\n\t      combinations to cover the most important use cases.\n\n\t      The list of packages belonging to this layer can be found in\n\t      section Core Packages\n\n       [3]    Last, but not least is the layer containing support packages\n\t      providing generic functionality which not necessarily belong\n\t      into the module.\n\n\t      The list of packages belonging to this layer can be found in\n\t      section Support Packages\n\n   USER PACKAGES\n       pt::pgen\n\n   CORE PACKAGES\n       This layer is further split into six sections handling the storage,\n       import, export, transformation, and execution of grammars, plus grammar\n       specific support packages.\n\n       Storage\n\n\t      pt::peg::container\n\n       Export\n\n\t      pt::peg::export\n\n\t      pt::peg::export::container\n\n\t      pt::peg::export::json\n\n\t      pt::peg::export::peg\n\n\t      pt::peg::to::container\n\n\t      pt::peg::to::json\n\n\t      pt::peg::to::peg\n\n\t      pt::peg::to::param\n\n\t      pt::peg::to::tclparam\n\n\t      pt::peg::to::cparam\n\n       Import\n\n\t      pt::peg::import\n\n\t      pt::peg::import::container\n\n\t      pt::peg::import::json\n\n\t      pt::peg::import::peg\n\n\t      pt::peg::from::container\n\n\t      pt::peg::from::json\n\n\t      pt::peg::from::peg\n\n       Transformation\n\n       Execution\n\n\t      pt::peg::interp\n\n\t      pt::rde\n\n       Support\n\n\t      pt::tclparam::configuration::snit\n\n\t      pt::tclparam::configuration::tcloo\n\n\t      pt::cparam::configuration::critcl\n\n\t      pt::ast\n\n\t      pt::pe\n\n\t      pt::peg\n\n   SUPPORT PACKAGES\n       pt::peg::container::peg\n\n       text::write\n\n       configuration\n\n       paths\n\n       char\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
