You can write something\n       like this and all of a sudden, you'd have an array with three\n       dimensions!\n\n\t   for my $x (1 .. 10) {\n\t       for my $y (1 .. 10) {\n\t\t   for my $z (1 .. 10) {\n\t\t       $AoA[$x][$y][$z] =\n\t\t\t   $x ** $y + $z;\n\t\t   }\n\t       }\n\t   }\n\n       Alas, however simple this may appear, underneath it's a much more\n       elaborate construct than meets the eye!\n\n       How do you print it out?  Why can't you say just \"print @AoA\"?  How do\n       you sort it?  How can you pass it to a function or get one of these\n       back from a function?  Is it an object?\tCan you save it to disk to\n       read back later?  How do you access whole rows or columns of that\n       matrix?\tDo all the values have to be numeric?\n\n       As you see, it's quite easy to become confused.\tWhile some small\n       portion of the blame for this can be attributed to the reference-based\n       implementation, it's really more due to a lack of existing\n       documentation with examples designed for the beginner.\n\n       This document is meant to be a detailed but understandable treatment of\n       the many different sorts of data structures you might want to develop.\n       It should also serve as a cookbook of examples.\tThat way, when you\n       need to create one of these complex data structures, you can just\n       pinch, pilfer, or purloin a drop-in example from here.\n\n       Let's look at each of these possible constructs in detail.  There are\n       separate sections on each of the following:\n\n       •    arrays of arrays\n\n       •    hashes of arrays\n\n       •    arrays of hashes\n\n       •    hashes of hashes\n\n       •    more elaborate constructs\n\n       But for now, let's look at general issues common to all these types of\n       data structures.\n\nREFERENCES\n       The most important thing to understand about all data structures in\n       Perl--including multidimensional arrays--is that even though they might\n       appear otherwise, Perl @ARRAYs and %HASHes are all internally one-\n       dimensional.  They can hold only scalar values (meaning a string,\n       number, or a reference).  They cannot directly contain other arrays or\n       hashes, but instead contain references to other arrays or hashes.\n\n       You can't use a reference to an array or hash in quite the same way\n       that you would a real array or hash.  For C or C++ programmers unused\n       to distinguishing between arrays and pointers to the same, this can be\n       confusing.  If so, just think of it as the difference between a\n       structure and a pointer to a structure.\n\n       You can (and should) read more about references in perlref.  Briefly,\n       references are rather like pointers that know what they point to.\n       (Objects are also a kind of reference, but we won't be needing them\n       right away--if ever.)  This means that when you have something which\n       looks to you like an access to a two-or-more-dimensional array and/or\n       hash, what's really going on is that the base type is merely a one-\n       dimensional entity that contains references to the next level.  It's\n       just that you can use it as though it were a two-dimensional one.  This\n       is actually the way almost all C multidimensional arrays work as well.\n\n\t   $array[7][12]\t\t       # array of arrays\n\t   $array[7]{string}\t\t       # array of hashes\n\t   $hash{string}[7]\t\t       # hash of arrays\n\t   $hash{string}{'another string'}     # hash of hashes\n\n       Now, because the top level contains only references, if you try to\n       print out your array in with a simple print() function, you'll get\n       something that doesn't look very nice, like this:\n\n\t   my @AoA = ( [2, 3], [4, 5, 7], [0] );\n\t   print $AoA[1][2];\n\t 7\n\t   print @AoA;\n\t ARRAY(0x83c38)ARRAY(0x8b194)ARRAY(0x8b1d0)\n\n       That's because Perl doesn't (ever) implicitly dereference your\n       variables.  If you want to get at the thing a reference is referring\n       to, then you have to do this yourself using either prefix typing\n       indicators, like \"${$blah}\", \"@{$blah}\", \"@{$blah[$i]}\", or else\n       postfix pointer arrows, like \"$a->[3]\", \"$h->{fred}\", or even\n       \"$ob->method()->[3]\".\n\nCOMMON MISTAKES\n       The two most common mistakes made in constructing something like an\n       array of arrays is either accidentally counting the number of elements\n       or else taking a reference to the same memory location repeatedly.\n       Here's the case where you just get the count instead of a nested array:\n\n\t   for my $i (1..10) {\n\t       my @array = somefunc($i);\n\t       $AoA[$i] = @array;      # WRONG!\n\t   }\n\n       That's just the simple case of assigning an array to a scalar and\n       getting its element count.  If that's what you really and truly want,\n       then you might do well to consider being a tad more explicit about it,\n       like this:\n\n\t   for my $i (1..10) {\n\t       my @array = somefunc($i);\n\t       $counts[$i] = scalar @array;\n\t   }\n\n       Here's the case of taking a reference to the same memory location again\n       and again:\n\n\t   # Either without strict or having an outer-scope my @array;\n\t   # declaration.\n\n\t   for my $i (1..10) {\n\t       @array = somefunc($i);\n\t       $AoA[$i] = \\@array;     # WRONG!\n\t   }\n\n       So, what's the big problem with that?  It looks right, doesn't it?\n       After all, I just told you that you need an array of references, so by\n       golly, you've made me one!\n\n       Unfortunately, while this is true, it's still broken.  All the\n       references in @AoA refer to the very same place, and they will\n       therefore all hold whatever was last in @array!\tIt's similar to the\n       problem demonstrated in the following C program:\n\n\t   #include <pwd.h>\n\t   main() {\n\t       struct passwd *getpwnam(), *rp, *dp;\n\t       rp = getpwnam(\"root\");\n\t       dp = getpwnam(\"daemon\");\n\n\t       printf(\"daemon name is %s\\nroot name is %s\\n\",\n\t\t       dp->pw_name, rp->pw_name);\n\t   }\n\n       Which will print\n\n\t   daemon name is daemon\n\t   root name is daemon\n\n       The problem is that both \"rp\" and \"dp\" are pointers to the same\n       location in memory!  In C, you'd have to remember to malloc() yourself\n       some new memory.  In Perl, you'll want to use the array constructor\n       \"[]\" or the hash constructor \"{}\" instead.   Here's the right way to do\n       the preceding broken code fragments:\n\n\t   # Either without strict or having an outer-scope my @array;\n\t   # declaration.\n\n\t   for my $i (1..10) {\n\t       @array = somefunc($i);\n\t       $AoA[$i] = [ @array ];\n\t   }\n\n       The square brackets make a reference to a new array with a copy of\n       what's in @array at the time of the assignment.\tThis is what you want.\n\n       Note that this will produce something similar:\n\n\t   # Either without strict or having an outer-scope my @array;\n\t   # declaration.\n\t   for my $i (1..10) {\n\t       @array = 0 .. $i;\n\t       $AoA[$i]->@* = @array;\n\t   }\n\n       Is it the same?\tWell, maybe so--and maybe not.\tThe subtle difference\n       is that when you assign something in square brackets, you know for sure\n       it's always a brand new reference with a new copy of the data.\n       Something else could be going on in this new case with the\n       \"$AoA[$i]->@*\" dereference on the left-hand-side of the assignment.  It\n       all depends on whether $AoA[$i] had been undefined to start with, or\n       whether it already contained a reference.  If you had already populated\n       @AoA with references, as in\n\n\t   $AoA[3] = \\@another_array;\n\n       Then the assignment with the indirection on the left-hand-side would\n       use the existing reference that was already there:\n\n\t   $AoA[3]->@* = @array;\n\n       Of course, this would have the \"interesting\" effect of clobbering\n       @another_array.\t(Have you ever noticed how when a programmer says\n       something is \"interesting\", that rather than meaning \"intriguing\",\n       they're disturbingly more apt to mean that it's \"annoying\",\n       \"difficult\", or both?  :-)\n\n       So just remember always to use the array or hash constructors with \"[]\"\n       or \"{}\", and you'll be fine, although it's not always optimally\n       efficient.\n\n       Surprisingly, the following dangerous-looking construct will actually\n       work out fine:\n\n\t   for my $i (1..10) {\n\t       my @array = somefunc($i);\n\t       $AoA[$i] = \\@array;\n\t   }\n\n       That's because my() is more of a run-time statement than it is a\n       compile-time declaration per se.  This means that the my() variable is\n       remade afresh each time through the loop.  So even though it looks as\n       though you stored the same variable reference each time, you actually\n       did not!  This is a subtle distinction that can produce more efficient\n       code at the risk of misleading all but the most experienced of\n       programmers.  So I usually advise against teaching it to beginners.  In\n       fact, except for passing arguments to functions, I seldom like to see\n       the gimme-a-reference operator (backslash) used much at all in code.\n       Instead, I advise beginners that they (and most of the rest of us)\n       should try to use the much more easily understood constructors \"[]\" and\n       \"{}\" instead of relying upon lexical (or dynamic) scoping and hidden\n       reference-counting to do the right thing behind the scenes.\n\n       Note also that there exists another way to write a dereference!\tThese\n       two lines are equivalent:\n\n\t   $AoA[$i]->@* = @array;\n\t   @{ $AoA[$i] } = @array;\n\n       The first form, called postfix dereference is generally easier to read,\n       because the expression can be read from left to right, and there are no\n       enclosing braces to balance.  On the other hand, it is also newer.  It\n       was added to the language in 2014, so you will often encounter the\n       other form, circumfix dereference, in older code.\n\n       In summary:\n\n\t   $AoA[$i] = [ @array ];     # usually best\n\t   $AoA[$i] = \\@array;\t      # perilous; just how my() was that array?\n\t   $AoA[$i]->@*  = @array;    # way too tricky for most programmers\n\t   @{ $AoA[$i] } = @array;    # just as tricky, and also harder to read\n\nCAVEAT ON PRECEDENCE\n       Speaking of things like \"@{$AoA[$i]}\", the following are actually the\n       same thing:\n\n\t   $aref->[2][2]       # clear\n\t   $$aref[2][2]        # confusing\n\n       That's because Perl's precedence rules on its five prefix dereferencers\n       (which look like someone swearing: \"$ @ * % &\") make them bind more\n       tightly than the postfix subscripting brackets or braces!  This will no\n       doubt come as a great shock to the C or C++ programmer, who is quite\n       accustomed to using *a[i] to mean what's pointed to by the i'th element\n       of \"a\".\tThat is, they first take the subscript, and only then\n       dereference the thing at that subscript.  That's fine in C, but this\n       isn't C.\n\n       The seemingly equivalent construct in Perl, $$aref[$i] first does the\n       deref of $aref, making it take $aref as a reference to an array, and\n       then dereference that, and finally tell you the i'th value of the array\n       pointed to by $AoA. If you wanted the C notion, you could write\n       \"$AoA[$i]->$*\" to explicitly dereference the i'th item, reading left to\n       right.\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD ALWAYS \"use strict\"\n       If this is starting to sound scarier than it's worth, relax.  Perl has\n       some features to help you avoid its most common pitfalls.  The best way\n       to avoid getting confused is to start every program with:\n\n\t   use strict;\n\n       This way, you'll be forced to declare all your variables with my() and\n       also disallow accidental \"symbolic dereferencing\".  Therefore if you'd\n       done this:\n\n\t   my $aref = [\n\t       [ \"fred\", \"barney\", \"pebbles\", \"bambam\", \"dino\", ],\n\t       [ \"homer\", \"bart\", \"marge\", \"maggie\", ],\n\t       [ \"george\", \"jane\", \"elroy\", \"judy\", ],\n\t   ];\n\n\t   print $aref[2][2];\n\n       The compiler would immediately flag that as an error at compile time,\n       because you were accidentally accessing @aref, an undeclared variable,\n       and it would thereby remind you to write instead:\n\n\t   print $aref->[2][2]\n\nDEBUGGING\n       You can use the debugger's \"x\" command to dump out complex data\n       structures.  For example, given the assignment to $AoA above, here's\n       the debugger output:\n\n\t   DB<1> x $AoA\n\t   $AoA = ARRAY(0x13b5a0)\n\t      0  ARRAY(0x1f0a24)\n\t\t 0  'fred'\n\t\t 1  'barney'\n\t\t 2  'pebbles'\n\t\t 3  'bambam'\n\t\t 4  'dino'\n\t      1  ARRAY(0x13b558)\n\t\t 0  'homer'\n\t\t 1  'bart'\n\t\t 2  'marge'\n\t\t 3  'maggie'\n\t      2  ARRAY(0x13b540)\n\t\t 0  'george'\n\t\t 1  'jane'\n\t\t 2  'elroy'\n\t\t 3  'judy'\n\nCODE EXAMPLES\n       Presented with little comment here are short code examples illustrating\n       access of various types of data structures.\n\nARRAYS OF ARRAYS\n   Declaration of an ARRAY OF ARRAYS\n\t@AoA = (\n\t       [ \"fred\", \"barney\" ],\n\t       [ \"george\", \"jane\", \"elroy\" ],\n\t       [ \"homer\", \"marge\", \"bart\" ],\n\t     );\n\n   Generation of an ARRAY OF ARRAYS\n\t# reading from file\n\twhile ( <> ) {\n\t    push @AoA, [ split ];\n\t}\n\n\t# calling a function\n\tfor $i ( 1 .. 10 ) {\n\t    $AoA[$i] = [ somefunc($i) ];\n\t}\n\n\t# using temp vars\n\tfor $i ( 1 .. 10 ) {\n\t    @tmp = somefunc($i);\n\t    $AoA[$i] = [ @tmp ];\n\t}\n\n\t# add to an existing row\n\tpush $AoA[0]->@*, \"wilma\", \"betty\";\n\n   Access and Printing of an ARRAY OF ARRAYS\n\t# one element\n\t$AoA[0][0] = \"Fred\";\n\n\t# another element\n\t$AoA[1][1] =~ s/(\\w)/\\u$1/;\n\n\t# print the whole thing with refs\n\tfor $aref ( @AoA ) {\n\t    print \"\\t [ @$aref ],\\n\";\n\t}\n\n\t# print the whole thing with indices\n\tfor $i ( 0 .. $#AoA ) {\n\t    print \"\\t [ $AoA[$i]->@* ],\\n\";\n\t}\n\n\t# print the whole thing one at a time\n\tfor $i ( 0 .. $#AoA ) {\n\t    for $j ( 0 .. $AoA[$i]->$#* ) {\n\t\tprint \"elem at ($i, $j) is $AoA[$i][$j]\\n\";\n\t    }\n\t}\n\nHASHES OF ARRAYS\n   Declaration of a HASH OF ARRAYS\n\t%HoA = (\n\t       flintstones\t  => [ \"fred\", \"barney\" ],\n\t       jetsons\t\t  => [ \"george\", \"jane\", \"elroy\" ],\n\t       simpsons \t  => [ \"homer\", \"marge\", \"bart\" ],\n\t     );\n\n   Generation of a HASH OF ARRAYS\n\t# reading from file\n\t# flintstones: fred barney wilma dino\n\twhile ( <> ) {\n\t    next unless s/^(.*?):\\s*//;\n\t    $HoA{$1} = [ split ];\n\t}\n\n\t# reading from file; more temps\n\t# flintstones: fred barney wilma dino\n\twhile ( $line = <> ) {\n\t    ($who, $rest) = split /:\\s*/, $line, 2;\n\t    @fields = split ' ', $rest;\n\t    $HoA{$who} = [ @fields ];\n\t}\n\n\t# calling a function that returns a list\n\tfor $group ( \"simpsons\", \"jetsons\", \"flintstones\" ) {\n\t    $HoA{$group} = [ get_family($group) ];\n\t}\n\n\t# likewise, but using temps\n\tfor $group ( \"simpsons\", \"jetsons\", \"flintstones\" ) {\n\t    @members = get_family($group);\n\t    $HoA{$group} = [ @members ];\n\t}\n\n\t# append new members to an existing family\n\tpush $HoA{flintstones}->@*, \"wilma\", \"betty\";\n\n   Access and Printing of a HASH OF ARRAYS\n\t# one element\n\t$HoA{flintstones}[0] = \"Fred\";\n\n\t# another element\n\t$HoA{simpsons}[1] =~ s/(\\w)/\\u$1/;\n\n\t# print the whole thing\n\tforeach $family ( keys %HoA ) {\n\t    print \"$family: $HoA{$family}->@* \\n\"\n\t}\n\n\t# print the whole thing with indices\n\tforeach $family ( keys %HoA ) {\n\t    print \"family: \";\n\t    foreach $i ( 0 .. $HoA{$family}->$#* ) {\n\t\tprint \" $i = $HoA{$family}[$i]\";\n\t    }\n\t    print \"\\n\";\n\t}\n\n\t# print the whole thing sorted by number of members\n\tforeach $family ( sort { $HoA{$b}->@* <=> $HoA{$a}->@* } keys %HoA ) {\n\t    print \"$family: $HoA{$family}->@* \\n\"\n\t}\n\n\t# print the whole thing sorted by number of members and name\n\tforeach $family ( sort {\n\t\t\t\t   $HoA{$b}->@* <=> $HoA{$a}->@*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ||\n\t\t\t\t\t     $a cmp $b\n\t\t   } keys %HoA )\n\t{\n\t    print \"$family: \", join(\", \", sort $HoA{$family}->@* ), \"\\n\";\n\t}\n\nARRAYS OF HASHES\n   Declaration of an ARRAY OF HASHES\n\t@AoH = (\n\t       {\n\t\t   Lead     => \"fred\",\n\t\t   Friend   => \"barney\",\n\t       },\n\t       {\n\t\t   Lead     => \"george\",\n\t\t   Wife     => \"jane\",\n\t\t   Son\t    => \"elroy\",\n\t       },\n\t       {\n\t\t   Lead     => \"homer\",\n\t\t   Wife     => \"marge\",\n\t\t   Son\t    => \"bart\",\n\t       }\n\t );\n\n   Generation of an ARRAY OF HASHES\n\t# reading from file\n\t# format: LEAD=fred FRIEND=barney\n\twhile ( <> ) {\n\t    $rec = {};\n\t    for $field ( split ) {\n\t\t($key, $value) = split /=/, $field;\n\t\t$rec->{$key} = $value;\n\t    }\n\t    push @AoH, $rec;\n\t}"
