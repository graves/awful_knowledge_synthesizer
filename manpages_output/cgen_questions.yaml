For the compiler frontend using this generator see the\n       package fileutil::magic::cfront.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::fileutil::magic::cgen::2tree script\n\t      This command converts the recognizer specified by the script\n\t      into a tree and returns the object command of that tree as its\n\t      result. It uses the package struct::tree for the tree."
