It provides a means to exchange\n     capabilities information prior to file transfer.\n\n     In this document, \"client\" refers to the openrsync(1) utility making the\n     request.  It follows that \"server\" refers to the daemon servicing the\n     request.\n\n     A connection between a client and server consists of host, a module, and\n     zero or more paths.\n\n\t   openrsync rsync://host/module/path1 rsync://host/path2... dest\n\n     At this time, operating in sender mode (with the rsync:// host receiving\n     information) is not described in this document.\n\n   Data types\n     These are the same as in rsync(5).  A newline is always a standalone \\n."
