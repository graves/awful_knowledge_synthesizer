    NAME
           perl58delta - what is new for perl v5.8.0

    DESCRIPTION
           This document describes differences between the 5.6.0 release and the
           5.8.0 release.

           Many of the bug fixes in 5.8.0 were already seen in the 5.6.1
           maintenance release since the two releases were kept closely
           coordinated (while 5.8.0 was still called 5.7.something).

           Changes that were integrated into the 5.6.1 release are marked "[561]".
           Many of these changes have been further developed since 5.6.1 was
           released, those are marked "[561+]".

           You can see the list of changes in the 5.6.1 release (both from the
           5.005_03 release and the 5.6.0 release) by reading perl561delta.

    Highlights In 5.8.0
           •   Better Unicode support

           •   New IO Implementation

           •   New Thread Implementation

           •   Better Numeric Accuracy

           •   Safe Signals

           •   Many New Modules

           •   More Extensive Regression Testing

    Incompatible Changes
       Binary Incompatibility
           Perl 5.8 is not binary compatible with earlier releases of Perl.

PerlIO is the default configuration because without it\n       many new features of Perl 5.8 cannot be used.

Also, usually\n       the system mallocs on such platforms are much better optimized for such\n       large memory models than the Perl malloc.  Some memory-hungry Perl\n       applications like the PDL don't work well with Perl's malloc.  Finally,\n       other applications than Perl (such as mod_perl) tend to prefer the\n       system malloc.  Such platforms include Alpha and 64-bit HPPA, MIPS,\n       PPC, and Sparc."

(Subroutine and \"our\" variables still get attributes applied at\n       compile-time.)  See attributes for additional details.  In particular,\n       however, this allows variable attributes to be useful for \"tie\"\n       interfaces, which was a deficiency of earlier releases.\tNote that the\n       new semantics doesn't work with the Attribute::Handlers module (as of\n       version 0.76).\n\n   Socket Extension Dynamic in VMS\n       The Socket extension is now dynamically loaded instead of being\n       statically built in.

    Manpage text:

    See perluniintro for the explanation of the current model, and utf8 for
           the current use of the utf8 pragma.

       New Unicode Properties
           Unicode scripts are now supported. Scripts are similar to (and superior
           to) Unicode blocks. The difference between scripts and blocks is that
           scripts are the glyphs used by a language or a group of languages,
           while the blocks are more artificial groupings of (mostly) 256
           characters based on the Unicode numbering.

           In general, scripts are more inclusive, but not universally so. For
           example, while the script "Latin" includes all the Latin characters and
           their various diacritic-adorned versions, it does not include the
           various punctuation or digits (since they are not solely "Latin").

           A number of other properties are now supported, including "\p{L&}",
           "\p{Any}" "\p{Assigned}", "\p{Unassigned}", "\p{Blank}" [561] and
           "\p{SpacePerl}" [561] (along with their "\P{...}" versions, of course).

    Manpage text:

    The "In" or "Is" prefix to names used with the "\p{...}" and "\P{...}"
           are now almost always optional. The only exception is that a "In"
           prefix is required to signify a Unicode block when a block name
           conflicts with a script name. For example, "\p{Tibetan}" refers to the
           script, while "\p{InTibetan}" refers to the block. When there is no
           name conflict, you can omit the "In" from the block name (e.g.
           "\p{BraillePatterns}"), but to be safe, it's probably best to always
           use the "In").

       REF(...) Instead Of SCALAR(...)
           A reference to a reference now stringifies as "REF(0x81485ec)" instead
           of "SCALAR(0x81485ec)" in order to be more consistent with the return
           value of ref().

       pack/unpack D/F recycled
           The undocumented pack/unpack template letters D/F have been recycled
           for better use: now they stand for long double (if supported by the
           platform) and NV (Perl internal floating point type).  (They used to be
           aliases for d/f, but you never knew that.)

    Safe Signals
           Perl used to be fragile in that signals arriving at inopportune moments
           could corrupt Perl's internal state.  Now Perl postpones handling of
           signals until it's safe (between opcodes).

           This change may have surprising side effects because signals no longer
           interrupt Perl instantly.  Perl will now first finish whatever it was
           doing, like finishing an internal operation (like sort()) or an
           external operation (like an I/O operation), and only then look at any
           arrived signals (and before starting the next operation).  No more
           corrupt internal state since the current operation is always finished
           first, but the signal may take more time to get heard.  Note that
           breaking out from potentially blocking operations should still work,
           though.

       Understanding of Numbers
           In general a lot of fixing has happened in the area of Perl's
           understanding of numbers, both integer and floating point.  Since in
           many systems the standard number parsing functions like "strtoul()" and
           "atof()" seem to have bugs, Perl tries to work around their
           deficiencies.  This results hopefully in more accurate numbers.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perl58delta`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPerl now tries internally to use integer values in numeric conversions\n       and basic arithmetics (+ - * /) if the arguments are integers, and\n       tries also to keep the results stored internally as integers.  This\n       change leads to often slightly faster and always less lossy\n       arithmetics. (Previously Perl always preferred floating point numbers\n       in its math.)\n\n   Arrays now always interpolate into double-quoted strings [561]\n       In double-quoted strings, arrays now interpolate, no matter what.  The\n       behavior in earlier versions of perl 5 was that arrays would\n       interpolate into strings if the array had been mentioned before the\n       string was compiled, and otherwise Perl would raise a fatal compile-\n       time error.  In versions 5.000 through 5.003, the error was\n\n\t       Literal @example now requires backslash\n\n       In versions 5.004_01 through 5.6.0, the error was\n\n\t       In string, @example now must be written as \\@example\n\n       The idea here was to get people into the habit of writing\n       \"fred\\@example.com\" when they wanted a literal \"@\" sign, just as they\n       have always written \"Give me back my \\$5\" when they wanted a literal\n       \"$\" sign."

    Manpage text:

    The failures in dumper.t and downgrade.t are problems in the tests,
           those in io_unix and sprintf are problems in the USS (UDP sockets and
           printf formats).  The pat, tr, and fold failures are genuine Perl
           problems caused by EBCDIC (and in the pat and fold cases, combining
           that with Unicode).  The Constant and Embed are probably problems in
           the tests (since they test Perl's ability to build extensions, and that
           seems to be working reasonably well.)

       Unicode Support on EBCDIC Still Spotty
           Though mostly working, Unicode support still has problem spots on
           EBCDIC platforms.  One such known spot are the "\p{}" and "\P{}"
           regular expression constructs for code points less than 256: the "pP"
           are testing for Unicode code points, not knowing about EBCDIC.

       Seen In Perl 5.7 But Gone Now
           "Time::Piece" (previously known as "Time::Object") was removed because
           it was felt that it didn't have enough value in it to be a core module.
           It is still a useful module, though, and is available from the CPAN.

    Perl 5.8 unfortunately does not build anymore on AmigaOS; this broke
           accidentally at some point.  Since there are not that many Amiga
           developers available, we could not get this fixed and tested in time
           for 5.8.0.  Perl 5.6.1 still works for AmigaOS (as does the 5.7.2
           development release).

           The "PerlIO::Scalar" and "PerlIO::Via" (capitalised) were renamed as
           "PerlIO::scalar" and "PerlIO::via" (all lowercase) just before 5.8.0.
           The main rationale was to have all core PerlIO layers to have all
           lowercase names.  The "plugins" are named as usual, for example
           "PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint".

           The "threads::shared::queue" and "threads::shared::semaphore" were
           renamed as "Thread::Queue" and "Thread::Semaphore" just before 5.8.0.
           The main rationale was to have thread modules to obey normal naming,
           "Thread::" (the "threads" and "threads::shared" themselves are more
           pragma-like, they affect compile-time, so they stay lowercase).
