    NAME
           perl5140delta - what is new for perl v5.14.0

    DESCRIPTION
           This document describes differences between the 5.12.0 release and the
           5.14.0 release.

           If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.10.0, first read
           perl5120delta, which describes differences between 5.10.0 and 5.12.0.

           Some of the bug fixes in this release have been backported to
           subsequent releases of 5.12.x.  Those are indicated with the 5.12.x
           version in parentheses.

    Notice
           As described in perlpolicy, the release of Perl 5.14.0 marks the
           official end of support for Perl 5.10.  Users of Perl 5.10 or earlier
           should consider upgrading to a more recent release of Perl.

    Core Enhancements
       Unicode
           Unicode Version 6.0 is now supported (mostly)

           Perl comes with the Unicode 6.0 data base updated with Corrigendum #8
           <http://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum8.html>, with one exception
           noted below.  See <http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/> for
           details on the new release.  Perl does not support any Unicode
           provisional properties, including the new ones for this release.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perl5140delta`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nUnicode 6.0 has chosen to use the name \"BELL\" for the character at\n       U+1F514, which is a symbol that looks like a bell, and is used in\n       Japanese cell phones.  This conflicts with the long-standing Perl usage\n       of having \"BELL\" mean the ASCII \"BEL\" character, U+0007.  In Perl 5.14,\n       \"\\N{BELL}\" continues to mean U+0007, but its use generates a\n       deprecation warning message unless such warnings are turned off.  The\n       new name for U+0007 in Perl is \"ALERT\", which corresponds nicely with\n       the existing shorthand sequence for it, \"\\a\".  \"\\N{BEL}\" means U+0007,\n       with no warning given.  The character at U+1F514 has no name in 5.14,\n       but can be referred to by \"\\N{U+1F514}\".  In Perl 5.16, \"\\N{BELL}\" will\n       refer to U+1F514; all code that uses \"\\N{BELL}\" should be converted to\n       use \"\\N{ALERT}\", \"\\N{BEL}\", or \"\\a\" before upgrading.\n\n       Full functionality for \"use feature 'unicode_strings'\"\n\n       This release provides full functionality for \"use feature\n       'unicode_strings'\".  Under its scope, all string operations executed\n       and regular expressions compiled (even if executed outside its scope)\n       have Unicode semantics.\tSee \"the 'unicode_strings' feature\" in\n       feature.  However, see \"Inverted bracketed character classes and multi-\n       character folds\", below."

It can handle Unicode named character\n\t   sequences, whereas the pre-existing charnames::vianame() cannot, as\n\t   the latter returns a single code point.\n\n       See charnames for details on all these changes.\n\n       New warnings categories for problematic (non-)Unicode code points.\n\n       Three new warnings subcategories of \"utf8\" have been added.  These\n       allow you to turn off some \"utf8\" warnings, while allowing other\n       warnings to remain on.  The three categories are: \"surrogate\" when\n       UTF-16 surrogates are encountered; \"nonchar\" when Unicode non-character\n       code points are encountered; and \"non_unicode\" when code points above\n       the legal Unicode maximum of 0x10FFFF are encountered."

However,\n       unless utf8 or the corresponding sub-category (see previous item) of\n       lexical warnings have been explicitly turned off, outputting or\n       executing a Unicode-defined operation such as upper-casing on such a\n       code point generates a warning.\tAttempting to input these using strict\n       rules (such as with the \":encoding(UTF-8)\" layer) will continue to\n       fail.  Prior to this release, handling was inconsistent and in places,\n       incorrect.\n\n       Unicode non-characters, some of which previously were erroneously\n       considered illegal in places by Perl, contrary to the Unicode Standard,\n       are now always legal internally.

    Manpage text:

    Earlier releases of Perl did allow this multi-character matching, but
           due to bugs, it mostly did not work.

           \400-\777

           In certain circumstances, "\400"-"\777" in regexes have behaved
           differently than they behave in all other doublequote-like contexts.
           Since 5.10.1, Perl has issued a deprecation warning when this happens.
           Now, these literals behave the same in all doublequote-like contexts,
           namely to be equivalent to "\x{100}"-"\x{1FF}", with no deprecation
           warning.

           Use of "\400"-"\777" in the command-line option -0 retain their
           conventional meaning.  They slurp whole input files; previously, this
           was documented only for -0777.

           Because of various ambiguities, you should use the new "\o{...}"
           construct to represent characters in octal instead.

           Most "\p{}" properties are now immune to case-insensitive matching

           For most Unicode properties, it doesn't make sense to have them match
           differently under "/i" case-insensitive matching.  Doing so can lead to
           unexpected results and potential security holes.  For example

           Perl source code is read in text mode on Windows

           Perl scripts used to be read in binary mode on Windows for the benefit
           of the ByteLoader module (which is no longer part of core Perl).  This
           had the side-effect of breaking various operations on the "DATA"

           "DATA" after filehandles have been flushed by a call to system(),
           backticks, fork() etc.

           The default build options for Windows have been changed to read Perl
           source code on Windows in text mode now.  ByteLoader will (hopefully)

           acts on a filehandle if the scalar happens to hold a typeglob.

           This is a long-standing bug that will be removed in Perl 5.16, as there
           is currently no way to tie the scalar itself when it holds a typeglob,

           multiple packages to get that same functionality.

           You can silence these deprecation warnings by installing the module in

    Optimisation of regexp engine string comparison work
           The "foldEQ_utf8" API function for case-insensitive comparison of
           strings (which is used heavily by the regexp engine) was substantially
           refactored and optimised -- and its documentation much improved as a
           free bonus.

       Regular expression compilation speed-up
           Compiling regular expressions has been made faster when upgrading the
           regex to utf8 is necessary but this isn't known when the compilation
           begins.

       String appending is 100 times faster
           When doing a lot of string appending, perls built to use the system's
           "malloc" could end up allocating a lot more memory than needed in a
           inefficient way.

           "sv_grow", the function used to allocate more memory if necessary when
           appending to a string, has been taught to round up the memory it
           requests to a certain geometric progression, making it much faster on
           certain platforms and configurations.  On Win32, it's now about 100

    Eliminate "PL_*" accessor functions under ithreads
           When "MULTIPLICITY" was first developed, and interpreter state moved
           into an interpreter struct, thread- and interpreter-local "PL_*"
           variables were defined as macros that called accessor functions
           (returning the address of the value) outside the Perl core.  The intent
           was to allow members within the interpreter struct to change size
           without breaking binary compatibility, so that bug fixes could be
           merged to a maintenance branch that necessitated such a size change.
           This mechanism was redundant and penalised well-behaved code.  It has
           been removed.

       Freeing weak references
           When there are many weak references to an object, freeing that object
           can under some circumstances take O(N*N) time to free, where N is the
           number of references.  The circumstances in which this can happen have

    Now we have found another way to speed up these assignments [perl
           #82110].

       @_ uses less memory
           Previously, @_ was allocated for every subroutine at compile time with
           enough space for four entries.  Now this allocation is done on demand
           when the subroutine is called [perl #72416].

       Size optimisations to SV and HV structures
           "xhv_fill" has been eliminated from "struct xpvhv", saving 1 IV per
           hash and on some systems will cause "struct xpvhv" to become cache-
           aligned.  To avoid this memory saving causing a slowdown elsewhere,
           boolean use of "HvFILL" now calls "HvTOTALKEYS" instead (which is
           equivalent), so while the fill data when actually required are now
           calculated on demand, cases when this needs to be done should be rare.

           The order of structure elements in SV bodies has changed.  Effectively,
           the NV slot has swapped location with STASH and MAGIC.  As all access
           to SV members is via macros, this should be completely transparent.
           This change allows the space saving for PVHVs documented above, and may

       New Documentation
           perlgpl

           perlgpl has been updated to contain GPL version 1, as is included in
           the README distributed with Perl (5.12.1).

           Perl 5.12.x delta files

           The perldelta files for Perl 5.12.1 to 5.12.3 have been added from the
           maintenance branch: perl5121delta, perl5122delta, perl5123delta.

           perlpodstyle

           New style guide for POD documentation, split mostly from the NOTES
           section of the pod2man(1) manpage.

           perlsource, perlinterp, perlhacktut, and perlhacktips

           See "perlhack and perlrepository revamp", below.

       Changes to Existing Documentation
           perlmodlib is now complete

           The perlmodlib manpage that came with Perl 5.12.0 was missing several
           modules due to a bug in the script that generates the list.  This has
           been fixed [perl #74332] (5.12.1).

           Replace incorrect tr/// table in perlebcdic

           perlebcdic contains a helpful table to use in "tr///" to convert
           between EBCDIC and Latin1/ASCII.  The table was the inverse of the one
           it describes, though the code that used the table worked correctly for
           the specific example given.

    The table has been corrected and the sample code changed to correspond.

           The table has also been changed to hex from octal, and the recipes in
           the pod have been altered to print out leading zeros to make all values
           the same length.

           Tricks for user-defined casing

           perlunicode now contains an explanation of how to override, mangle and
           otherwise tweak the way Perl handles upper-, lower- and other-case
           conversions on Unicode data, and how to provide scoped changes to alter
           one's own code's behaviour without stomping on anybody else's.

           INSTALL explicitly states that Perl requires a C89 compiler

           This was already true, but it's now Officially Stated For The Record
           (5.12.2).

           Explanation of "\xHH" and "\oOOO" escapes

           perlop has been updated with more detailed explanation of these two
           character escapes.

           affects formats.

           overload

           overload's documentation has practically undergone a rewrite.  It is
           now much more straightforward and clear.

           perlhack and perlrepository revamp

           The perlhack document is now much shorter, and focuses on the Perl 5
           development process and submitting patches to Perl.  The technical
           content has been moved to several new documents, perlsource,
           perlinterp, perlhacktut, and perlhacktips.  This technical content has
           been only lightly edited.

           Custom per-subroutine check hooks

           XS code in an extension module can now annotate a subroutine (whether

           at compile time (specifically as part of op checking) to change the op

           the extension module) can implement argument processing that can't be
           expressed as a prototype, generate customised compile-time warnings,

    List op-building functions have been added to the API.  See
           op_append_elem, op_append_list, and op_prepend_elem in perlapi.

           "LINKLIST"

           The LINKLIST macro, part of op building that constructs the execution-
           order op chain, has been added to the API.

           Localisation functions

           The "save_freeop", "save_op", "save_pushi32ptr" and "save_pushptrptr"
           functions have been added to the API.

           Stash names

           A stash can now have a list of effective names in addition to its usual
           name.  The first effective name can be accessed via the "HvENAME"
           macro, which is now the recommended name to use in MRO linearisations
           ("HvNAME" being a fallback if there is no "HvENAME").

           These names are added and deleted via "hv_ename_add" and
           "hv_ename_delete".  These two functions are not part of the API.

           New functions for finding and removing magic

           The "mg_findext()" and "sv_unmagicext()" functions have been added to
           the API. They allow extension authors to find and remove magic attached
           to scalars based on both the magic type and the magic virtual table,
           similar to how sv_magicext() attaches magic of a certain type and with
           a given virtual table to a scalar.  This eliminates the need for
           extensions to walk the list of "MAGIC" pointers of an "SV" to find the
           magic that belongs to them.

           Perl_croak_no_modify() is short-hand for "Perl_croak("%s",

           "PERL_STATIC_INLINE" define

           The "PERL_STATIC_INLINE" define has been added to provide the best-
           guess incantation to use for static inline functions, if the C compiler
           supports C99-style static inline.  If it doesn't, it'll give a plain

           "HAS_STATIC_INLINE" can be used to check if the compiler actually

           A new option, "PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NONASCII", has been added to "pv_escape"
           to dump all characters above ASCII in hexadecimal.  Before, one could
           get all characters as hexadecimal or the Latin1 non-ASCII as octal.

    Perl_fetch_cop_label

           The first argument of the C API function "Perl_fetch_cop_label" has
           changed from "struct refcounted_he *" to "COP *", to insulate the user
           from implementation details.

           This API function was marked as "may change", and likely isn't in use
           outside the core.  (Neither an unpacked CPAN nor Google's codesearch
           finds any other references to it.)

           GvCV() and GvGP() are no longer lvalues

           The new GvCV_set() and GvGP_set() macros are now provided to replace
           assignment to those two macros.

           This allows a future commit to eliminate some backref magic between GV
           and CVs, which will require complete control over assignment to the
           "gp_cv" slot.

           CvGV() is no longer an lvalue

           Under some circumstances, the CvGV() field of a CV is now reference-
           counted.  To ensure consistent behaviour, direct assignment to it, for
           example "CvGV(cv) = gv" is now a compile-time error.  A new macro,
           "CvGV_set(cv,gv)" has been introduced to run this operation safely.
           Note that modification of this field is not part of the public API,
           regardless of this new macro (and despite its being listed in this
           section).

    CvSTASH() is no longer an lvalue

           The CvSTASH() macro can now only be used as an rvalue.  CvSTASH_set()
           has been added to replace assignment to CvSTASH().  This is to ensure
           that backreferences are handled properly.  These macros are not part of
           the API.

           Calling conventions for "newFOROP" and "newWHILEOP"

           The way the parser handles labels has been cleaned up and refactored.
           As a result, the newFOROP() constructor function no longer takes a
           parameter stating what label is to go in the state op.

           The newWHILEOP() and newFOROP() functions no longer accept a line
           number as a parameter.

           Flags passed to "uvuni_to_utf8_flags" and "utf8n_to_uvuni"

           Some of the flags parameters to uvuni_to_utf8_flags() and
           utf8n_to_uvuni() have changed.  This is a result of Perl's now allowing
           internal storage and manipulation of code points that are problematic
           in some situations.  Hence, the default actions for these functions has
           been complemented to allow these code points.  The new flags are
           documented in perlapi.  Code that requires the problematic code points
           to be rejected needs to change to use the new flags.  Some flag names
           are retained for backward source compatibility, though they do nothing,
           as they are now the default.  However the flags "UNICODE_ALLOW_FDD0",
           "UNICODE_ALLOW_FFFF", "UNICODE_ILLEGAL", and "UNICODE_IS_ILLEGAL" have
           been removed, as they stem from a fundamentally broken model of how the
           Unicode non-character code points should be handled, which is now
           described in "Non-character code points" in perlunicode.  See also the

    Obituary
           Randy Kobes, creator of http://kobesearch.cpan.org/ and
           contributor/maintainer to several core Perl toolchain modules, passed
           away on September 18, 2010 after a battle with lung cancer.  The
           community was richer for his involvement.  He will be missed.

           Perl 5.14.0 represents one year of development since Perl 5.12.0 and
           contains nearly 550,000 lines of changes across nearly 3,000 files from
           150 authors and committers.

           Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
           community of users and developers.  The following people are known to

           If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
           recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the Perl bug
           database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
           information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

           If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
           program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
           tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
           of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
           the Perl porting team.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perl5140delta`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIf the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it\n       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please\n       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed\n       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core\n       committers, who are able to help assess the impact of issues, figure\n       out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to\n       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is\n       supported.  Please use this address for security issues in the Perl\n       core only, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for an explanation of how to view exhaustive details\n       on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t      PERL5140DELTA(1)"
