      You are playing the role of a college professor writing final exam questions. Here is some text copied from the ch05-01-defining-structs page of the documentation provided by Rust.

      Please synthesize 3 questions that exercise the code or tools documented where the answer contains correct usage of the most common parameters or flags. The questions must be able to be answered without the documentation available, so there should be no definite articles referring to specific code from the documentation, only indefinite articles should be used. The questions should prove the student understands the concepts and APIs. The questions should be answerable by a code example or a command example.
