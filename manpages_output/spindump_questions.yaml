Reports are stored at:\n\n     /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/\n\n     For normal application force quits spindump will display a dialog to\n     offer the choice to view more details and/or send a report to Apple.\n\n     -------------------------------------\n\n     When run manually, spindump samples user and kernel callstacks for every\n     process in the system. Spindump supports two display formats for\n     callstacks, heavy and timeline, and includes a binary representation of\n     its data at the end of reports for re-reporting with different options\n     (see -i ). Spindump can also parse reports in timeline format even\n     without a binary representation to re-report them in heavy format."

    Manpage text:

    When displayed in heavy format, callstacks are sorted by count and each
         unique callstack is displayed once. In this snippet:

         84  __CFRunLoopRun + 1161 (CoreFoundation + 460665) [0x7fff8d662779]

         Address 0x7fff8d662779 was sampled 84 times in total, not necessarily
         consecutively. The address corresponds __CFRunLoopRun in CoreFoundation.

         When displayed in timeline format, callstacks are sorted so that the leaf
         frames in the call tree are presented in chronological order. Each frame
         includes a time range of consecutive callstacks in which the frame was
         seen, which can be compared with the range of other frames to determine
         concurrency. If multiple samples of the same callstack were not
         consecutive, the callstack will be displayed multiple times. In this
         snippet:

         23  __CFRunLoopRun + 1161 (CoreFoundation + 460665) [0x7fff8d662779]
         50-72

         Address 0x7fff8d662779 was sampled 23 times consecutively from the 50th
         to 72nd sample.

    Manpage text:

    In timeline format, spindump notes state changes for threads, e.g.:

         <darwinbg, timers coalesced>

         which indicates the change in state for the samples that follow. Any
         state not mentioned is unchanged from previous samples. The state
         information spindump reports includes thread QoS, darwinbg, importance
         inheritance boost, suppression for App Nap, latency QoS (timers), I/O
         throttling tier, and cpu priority.

         Leaf frames will indicate whether the thread was running/runnable or
         suspended.

         A leading star (*) indicates a kernel frame or library.

    ARGUMENTS
         pid or partial-name the process to be sorted topmost in the report.
         "-notarget" may be used to avoid providing a target process when
         specifying a duration and interval.

         duration the duration of the sampling in seconds. If not specified, the
         default of 10 seconds is used.  interval the number of miliseconds
         between samples. If not specified, the default of 10 miliseconds is used.

    MICROSTACKSHOTS
         Microstackshots are gathered by the kernel to provide extremely
         lightweight sampling of single threads at a time. They can be viewed in
         spindump via the microstackshot command line options:

         -microstackshots Report on interrupt microstackshots, which provide a
         sampling of where cpu time is spent. This is the default mode if
         -microstackshots_io is not provided

         -microstackshots_io Report on I/O microstackshots, which provide a
         sampling of where file backed memory is dirtied

         -microstackshots_datastore path When reporting microstackshots, read from
         this location rather than using the live system's microstackshots. When
         saving with -microstackshots_save, write to this location

         -microstackshots_save Save microstackshot from the live system to the
         path specified by -microstackshots_datastore instead of generating a
