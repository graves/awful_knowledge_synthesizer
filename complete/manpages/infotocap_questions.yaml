Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `infotocap`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\ninfotocap(1M)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t infotocap(1M)\n\nNAME\n       infotocap - convert a terminfo description into a termcap description\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       infotocap [-vn width]  [-V] [-1] [-w width] file . . .\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       infotocap looks in each given text file for terminfo descriptions.  For\n       each terminfo description found, an equivalent termcap description is\n       written to standard output.  Terminfo use capabilities are translated\n       directly to termcap tc capabilities.\n\n       -v   print out tracing information on standard error as the program\n\t    runs.\n\n       -V   print out the version of the program in use on standard error and\n\t    exit.\n\n       -1   cause the fields to print out one to a line.  Otherwise, the\n\t    fields will be printed several to a line to a maximum width of 60\n\t    characters.\n\n       -w   change the output to width characters.\n\nFILES\n       /usr/share/terminfo Compiled terminal description database.\n\nNOTES\n       This utility is actually a link to tic, running in -C mode.  You can\n       use other tic options such as -f and  -x."
