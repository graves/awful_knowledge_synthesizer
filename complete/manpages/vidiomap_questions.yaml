Optionally,\n       vidiomap can be used to \"defragment\" and \"resequence\" those files.\n       Optionally, multiple target directories may be specified.\n\n       The vidiomap utility is intended to be used primarily on video frame\n       files within a directory.  It is not indented for use as a general\n       purpose file system allocation analysis or \"defragmentation\" utility.\n       See snfsdefrag(1).\n\n       Without options, vidiomap will print a summary analysis of the\n       allocation of files in the target directory, including the number of\n       regular files, the total number of extents, and space consumed.\tAlso\n       printed is information relating to the total number and average size of\n       the gaps between the extents."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `vidiomap`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe -v option may be used to provide detailed information about file\n       allocation on a per extent basis.  The actual file system block numbers\n       consumed are printed along with the gaps between extents.  Notice that\n       gaps can be negative, indicating the subsequent allocation was to a\n       lesser file system block number than the current allocation.\n\n       To analyze the allocation of files within a directory, the desired file\n       order first must be determined.\tBy default, vidiomap will sort all the\n       files in the target directory alpha-numerically by file name.\n       Optionally, file names may be filtered by file prefix and file suffix.\n       See the -p and -s options.  Optionally, a list of file names may be\n       provided.  See the -f option.\n\n       The \"resequencing\" and \"defragmentation\" of files is a multi-step\n       process that makes heavy use of the StorNext file System Application\n       Programming Interface, SNAPI.  The steps are a follows:\n\n\t  1.  Determine the file order."

For each file, a \"shadow file\" is created and blocks are preallocated.\n\n\t  3.  The data is copied from the original file, to the shadow file.\n\n\t  4.  The newly allocated extents are swapped into the original file inode.\n\n\t  5.  The \"shadow files\" are removed.\n\n       Shadow files are named filename_shadow and are created in the target\n       directory.\n\n       As stated previously, vidiomap is not a general purpose file system\n       \"defragmentor\".\tAn older file system or a file system nearing capacity\n       may have a fragmented free space pool. Using vidiomap to resequence\n       files may not help in this case and could make fragmentation worse.\n       Consider using snfsdefrag before resequencing files with vidiomap.\n\n       The resequencing option is intended to work with the StorNext\n       Allocation Session Reservation feature.\tThis feature is managed using\n       the GUI or by modifying the allocSessionReservationSize parameter, see\n       snfs_config(5).\n\n       Because resequencing copies the data to the newly allocated space,\n       consider the performance impact of resequencing files on a production\n       system.\tResequencing a large number of files can take some time,\n       depending on the size of the files, the performance of the underlying\n       storage, and other file system activity."
