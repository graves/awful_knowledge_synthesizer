It\n       supports these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS, HTTP,\n       HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP,\n       SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, TFTP, WS and WSS.\n\n       curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See\n       libcurl(3) for details.\n\nURL\n       The URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You find a detailed description\n       in RFC 3986.\n\n       If you provide a URL without a leading protocol:// scheme, curl guesses\n       what protocol you want. It then defaults to HTTP but assumes others\n       based on often-used host name prefixes. For example, for host names\n       starting with \"ftp.\" curl assumes you want FTP.\n\n       You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They are\n       fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order unless you use\n       -Z, --parallel. You can specify command line options and URLs mixed and\n       in any order on the command line."

    Manpage text:

    curl attempts to reuse connections when doing multiple transfers, so
           that getting many files from the same server do not use multiple
           connects and setup handshakes. This improves speed. Connection reuse
           can only be done for URLs specified for a single command line
           invocation and cannot be performed between separate curl runs.

           Provide an IPv6 zone id in the URL with an escaped percentage sign.
           Like in

           "http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/"

           Everything provided on the command line that is not a command line
           option or its argument, curl assumes is a URL and treats it as such.

    GLOBBING
           You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing lists within
           braces or ranges within brackets. We call this "globbing".

           Provide a list with three different names like this:

           "http://site.{one,two,three}.com"

           Do sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

           "ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt"

           With letters through the alphabet:

           "ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt"

           Nested sequences are not supported, but you can use several ones next
           to each other:

           "http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html"

           You can specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number
           or letter:

           "http://example.com/file[1-100:10].txt"

           "http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt"

           When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line prompt,
           you probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the
           shell from interfering with it. This also goes for other characters
           treated special, like for example '&', '?' and '*'.

           Switch off globbing with -g, --globoff.

    VARIABLES
           curl supports command line variables (added in 8.3.0). Set variables
           with --variable name=content or --variable name@file (where "file" can
           be stdin if set to a single dash (-)).

    Variable contents can be expanded in option parameters using "{{name}}"
           (without the quotes) if the option name is prefixed with "--expand-".
           This gets the contents of the variable "name" inserted, or a blank if
           the name does not exist as a variable. Insert "{{" verbatim in the
           string by prefixing it with a backslash, like "\{{".

           You an access and expand environment variables by first importing them.
           You can select to either require the environment variable to be set or
           you can provide a default value in case it is not already set. Plain
           --variable %name imports the variable called 'name' but exits with an
           error if that environment variable is not already set. To provide a
           default value if it is not set, use --variable %name=content or
           --variable %name@content.

           Example. Get the USER environment variable into the URL, fail if USER
           is not set:

           --variable '%USER'
           --expand-url = "https://example.com/api/{{USER}}/method"

    When expanding variables, curl supports a set of functions that can
           make the variable contents more convenient to use. It can trim leading
           and trailing white space with trim, it can output the contents as a
           JSON quoted string with json, URL encode the string with url or base64
           encode it with b64. You apply function to a variable expansion, add
           them colon separated to the right side of the variable. Variable
           content holding null bytes that are not encoded when expanded cause
           error.

           Example: get the contents of a file called $HOME/.secret into a
           variable called "fix". Make sure that the content is trimmed and
           percent-encoded sent as POST data:

           --variable %HOME
           --expand-variable fix@{{HOME}}/.secret
           --expand-data "{{fix:trim:url}}"
           https://example.com/

           Command line variables and expansions were added in in 8.3.0.

    OUTPUT
           If not told otherwise, curl writes the received data to stdout. It can
           be instructed to instead save that data into a local file, using the
           -o, --output or -O, --remote-name options. If curl is given multiple
           URLs to transfer on the command line, it similarly needs multiple
           options for where to save them.

    TFTP   curl can do TFTP downloads and uploads.

    PROGRESS METER
           curl normally displays a progress meter during operations, indicating
           the amount of transferred data, transfer speeds and estimated time
           left, etc. The progress meter displays the transfer rate in bytes per
           second. The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For example 1k is
           1024 bytes. 1M is 1048576 bytes.

           curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so if you invoke
           curl to do an operation and it is about to write data to the terminal,
           it disables the progress meter as otherwise it would mess up the output
           mixing progress meter and response data.

           If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you need to
           redirect the response output to a file, using shell redirect (>), -o,
           --output or similar.

           This does not apply to FTP upload as that operation does not spit out
           any response data to the terminal.

           If you prefer a progress "bar" instead of the regular meter, -#,
           --progress-bar is your friend. You can also disable the progress meter
           completely with the -s, --silent option.

This option overrides\n\t      that variable.\n\n\t      The windows version of curl automatically looks for a CA certs\n\t      file named 'curl-ca-bundle.crt', either in the same directory as\n\t      curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any folder\n\t      along your PATH.\n\n\t      (iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure Transport,\n\t      then this option is supported for backward compatibility with\n\t      other SSL engines, but it should not be set. If the option is\n\t      not set, then curl uses the certificates in the system and user\n\t      Keychain to verify the peer, which is the preferred method of\n\t      verifying the peer's certificate chain."

A\n\t      single line is required to be no more than 10 megabytes (since\n\t      8.2.0).\n\n\t      Specify the filename to -K, --config as '-' to make curl read\n\t      the file from stdin.\n\n\t      Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config file, you\n\t      need to specify it using the --url option, and not by simply\n\t      writing the URL on its own line. So, it could look similar to\n\t      this:\n\n\t      url = \"https://curl.se/docs/\"\n\n\t      # --- Example file ---\n\t      # this is a comment\n\t      url = \"example.com\"\n\t      output = \"curlhere.html\"\n\t      user-agent = \"superagent/1.0\"\n\n\t      # and fetch another URL too\n\t      url = \"example.com/docs/manpage.html\"\n\t      -O\n\t      referer = \"http://nowhereatall.example.com/\"\n\t      # --- End of example file ---\n\n\t      When curl is invoked, it (unless -q, --disable is used) checks\n\t      for a default config file and uses it if found, even when -K,\n\t      --config is used. The default config file is checked for in the\n\t      following places in this order:\n\n\t      1) \"$CURL_HOME/.curlrc\"\n\n\t      2) \"$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/curlrc\" (Added in 7.73.0)\n\n\t      3) \"$HOME/.curlrc\"\n\n\t      4) Windows: \"%USERPROFILE%\\.curlrc\"\n\n\t      5) Windows: \"%APPDATA%\\.curlrc\"\n\n\t      6) Windows: \"%USERPROFILE%\\Application Data\\.curlrc\"\n\n\t      7) Non-Windows: use getpwuid to find the home directory\n\n\t      8) On Windows, if it finds no .curlrc file in the sequence\n\t      described above, it checks for one in the same dir the curl\n\t      executable is placed.\n\n\t      On Windows two filenames are checked per location: .curlrc and\n\t      _curlrc, preferring the former. Older versions on Windows\n\t      checked for _curlrc only.\n\n\t      --config can be used several times in a command line\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --config file.txt https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -q, --disable.\n\n       --connect-timeout <fractional seconds>\n\t      Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl's connection to\n\t      take. This only limits the connection phase, so if curl connects\n\t      within the given period it continues - if not it exits.\n\n\t      This option accepts decimal values. The decimal value needs to\n\t      be provided using a dot (.) as decimal separator - not the local\n\t      version even if it might be using another separator.\n\n\t      The connection phase is considered complete when the DNS lookup\n\t      and requested TCP, TLS or QUIC handshakes are done.\n\n\t      If --connect-timeout is provided several times, the last set\n\t      value is used.\n\n\t      Examples:\n\t       curl --connect-timeout 20 https://example.com\n\t       curl --connect-timeout 3.14 https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -m, --max-time.\n\n       --connect-to <HOST1:PORT1:HOST2:PORT2>\n\t      For a request to the given \"HOST1:PORT1\" pair, connect to\n\t      \"HOST2:PORT2\" instead. This option is suitable to direct\n\t      requests at a specific server, e.g. at a specific cluster node\n\t      in a cluster of servers. This option is only used to establish\n\t      the network connection. It does NOT affect the hostname/port\n\t      that is used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI, certificate verification) or\n\t      for the application protocols. \"HOST1\" and \"PORT1\" may be the\n\t      empty string, meaning \"any host/port\". \"HOST2\" and \"PORT2\" may\n\t      also be the empty string, meaning \"use the request's original\n\t      host/port\".\n\n\t      A hostname specified to this option is compared as a string, so\n\t      it needs to match the name used in request URL. It can be either\n\t      numerical such as \"127.0.0.1\" or the full host name such as\n\t      \"example.org\".\n\n\t      --connect-to can be used several times in a command line\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --connect-to example.com:443:example.net:8443 https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --resolve and -H, --header.\n\n       -C, --continue-at <offset>\n\t      Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at the given offset.\n\t      The given offset is the exact number of bytes that are skipped,\n\t      counting from the beginning of the source file before it is\n\t      transferred to the destination. If used with uploads, the FTP\n\t      server command SIZE is not used by curl.\n\n\t      Use \"-C -\" to tell curl to automatically find out where/how to\n\t      resume the transfer. It then uses the given output/input files\n\t      to figure that out.\n\n\t      If --continue-at is provided several times, the last set value\n\t      is used.\n\n\t      Examples:\n\t       curl -C - https://example.com\n\t       curl -C 400 https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -r, --range.\n\n       -c, --cookie-jar <filename>\n\t      (HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all cookies\n\t      after a completed operation. Curl writes all cookies from its\n\t      in-memory cookie storage to the given file at the end of\n\t      operations. If no cookies are known, no data is written. The\n\t      file is created using the Netscape cookie file format. If you\n\t      set the file name to a single dash, \"-\", the cookies are written\n\t      to stdout.\n\n\t      The file specified with -c, --cookie-jar is only used for\n\t      output. No cookies are read from the file. To read cookies, use\n\t      the -b, --cookie option. Both options can specify the same file.\n\n\t      This command line option activates the cookie engine that makes\n\t      curl record and use cookies. The -b, --cookie option also\n\t      activates it.\n\n\t      If the cookie jar cannot be created or written to, the whole\n\t      curl operation does not fail or even report an error clearly.\n\t      Using -v, --verbose gets a warning displayed, but that is the\n\t      only visible feedback you get about this possibly lethal\n\t      situation.\n\n\t      If --cookie-jar is provided several times, the last set value is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      Examples:\n\t       curl -c store-here.txt https://example.com\n\t       curl -c store-here.txt -b read-these https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -b, --cookie.\n\n       -b, --cookie <data|filename>\n\t      (HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server in the Cookie header. It\n\t      is supposedly the data previously received from the server in a\n\t      \"Set-Cookie:\" line. The data should be in the format\n\t      \"NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2\". This makes curl use the cookie\n\t      header with this content explicitly in all outgoing request(s).\n\t      If multiple requests are done due to authentication, followed\n\t      redirects or similar, they all get this cookie passed on.\n\n\t      If no '=' symbol is used in the argument, it is instead treated\n\t      as a filename to read previously stored cookie from. This option\n\t      also activates the cookie engine which makes curl record\n\t      incoming cookies, which may be handy if you are using this in\n\t      combination with the -L, --location option or do multiple URL\n\t      transfers on the same invoke.\n\n\t      If the file name is exactly a minus (\"-\"), curl instead reads\n\t      the contents from stdin. If the file name is an empty string\n\t      (\"\") and is the only cookie input, curl will activate the cookie\n\t      engine without any cookies.\n\n\t      The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain\n\t      HTTP headers (Set-Cookie style) or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie\n\t      file format.\n\n\t      The file specified with -b, --cookie is only used as input. No\n\t      cookies are written to the file. To store cookies, use the -c,\n\t      --cookie-jar option.\n\n\t      If you use the Set-Cookie file format and do not specify a\n\t      domain then the cookie is not sent since the domain never\n\t      matches. To address this, set a domain in Set-Cookie line (doing\n\t      that includes subdomains) or preferably: use the Netscape\n\t      format.\n\n\t      Users often want to both read cookies from a file and write\n\t      updated cookies back to a file, so using both -b, --cookie and\n\t      -c, --cookie-jar in the same command line is common.\n\n\t      If curl is built with PSL (Public Suffix List) support, it\n\t      detects and discards cookies that are specified for such suffix\n\t      domains that should not be allowed to have cookies. If curl is\n\t      not built with PSL support, it has no ability to stop super\n\t      cookies.\n\n\t      --cookie can be used several times in a command line\n\n\t      Examples:\n\t       curl -b \"\" https://example.com\n\t       curl -b cookiefile https://example.com\n\t       curl -b cookiefile -c cookiefile https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -c, --cookie-jar and -j, --junk-session-cookies.\n\n       --create-dirs\n\t      When used in conjunction with the -o, --output option, curl\n\t      creates the necessary local directory hierarchy as needed. This\n\t      option creates the directories mentioned with the -o, --output\n\t      option combined with the path possibly set with --output-dir. If\n\t      the combined output file name uses no directory, or if the\n\t      directories it mentions already exist, no directories are\n\t      created.\n\n\t      Created directories are made with mode 0750 on unix style file\n\t      systems.\n\n\t      To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try\n\t      --ftp-create-dirs.\n\n\t      Providing --create-dirs multiple times has no extra effect.\n\t      Disable it again with --no-create-dirs.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --create-dirs --output local/dir/file https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --ftp-create-dirs and --output-dir.\n\n       --create-file-mode <mode>\n\t      (SFTP SCP FILE) When curl is used to create files remotely using\n\t      one of the supported protocols, this option allows the user to\n\t      set which 'mode' to set on the file at creation time, instead of\n\t      the default 0644.\n\n\t      This option takes an octal number as argument.\n\n\t      If --create-file-mode is provided several times, the last set\n\t      value is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --create-file-mode 0777 -T localfile sftp://example.com/new\n\n\t      See also --ftp-create-dirs.

The <data>\n\t      part can be passed to curl using one of the following syntaxes:\n\n\t      content\n\t\t     This makes curl URL-encode the content and pass that on.\n\t\t     Just be careful so that the content does not contain any\n\t\t     = or @ symbols, as that makes the syntax match one of the\n\t\t     other cases below!\n\n\t      =content\n\t\t     This makes curl URL-encode the content and pass that on.\n\t\t     The preceding = symbol is not included in the data.\n\n\t      name=content\n\t\t     This makes curl URL-encode the content part and pass that\n\t\t     on. Note that the name part is expected to be URL-encoded\n\t\t     already.\n\n\t      @filename\n\t\t     This makes curl load data from the given file (including\n\t\t     any newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it on in the\n\t\t     POST.\n\n\t      name@filename\n\t\t     This makes curl load data from the given file (including\n\t\t     any newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it on in the\n\t\t     POST. The name part gets an equal sign appended,\n\t\t     resulting in name=urlencoded-file-content. Note that the\n\t\t     name is expected to be URL-encoded already."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `curl`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n--data-urlencode can be used several times in a command line\n\n\t      Examples:\n\t       curl --data-urlencode name=val https://example.com\n\t       curl --data-urlencode =encodethis https://example.com\n\t       curl --data-urlencode name@file https://example.com\n\t       curl --data-urlencode @fileonly https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -d, --data and --data-raw.\n\n       -d, --data <data>\n\t      (HTTP MQTT) Sends the specified data in a POST request to the\n\t      HTTP server, in the same way that a browser does when a user has\n\t      filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This makes\n\t      curl pass the data to the server using the content-type\n\t      application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Compare to -F, --form.\n\n\t      --data-raw is almost the same but does not have a special\n\t      interpretation of the @ character. To post data purely binary,\n\t      you should instead use the --data-binary option. To URL-encode\n\t      the value of a form field you may use --data-urlencode.\n\n\t      If any of these options is used more than once on the same\n\t      command line, the data pieces specified are merged with a\n\t      separating &-symbol. Thus, using '-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy'\n\t      would generate a post chunk that looks like\n\t      'name=daniel&skill=lousy'.\n\n\t      If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a\n\t      file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl to read\n\t      the data from stdin. Posting data from a file named 'foobar'\n\t      would thus be done with -d, --data @foobar. When -d, --data is\n\t      told to read from a file like that, carriage returns and\n\t      newlines are stripped out. If you do not want the @ character to\n\t      have a special interpretation use --data-raw instead.\n\n\t      The data for this option is passed on to the server exactly as\n\t      provided on the command line. curl does not convert, change or\n\t      improve it. It is up to the user to provide the data in the\n\t      correct form.\n\n\t      --data can be used several times in a command line\n\n\t      Examples:\n\t       curl -d \"name=curl\" https://example.com\n\t       curl -d \"name=curl\" -d \"tool=cmdline\" https://example.com\n\t       curl -d @filename https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --data-binary, --data-urlencode and --data-raw.

When curl stops waiting, it\n\t      continues as if the response has been received.\n\n\t      The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.) as decimal\n\t      separator - not the local version even if it might be using\n\t      another separator.\n\n\t      If --expect100-timeout is provided several times, the last set\n\t      value is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --expect100-timeout 2.5 -T file https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --connect-timeout.\n\n       --fail-early\n\t      Fail and exit on the first detected transfer error.\n\n\t      When curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command line,\n\t      it attempts to operate on each given URL, one by one. By\n\t      default, it ignores errors if there are more URLs given and the\n\t      last URL's success determines the error code curl returns. So\n\t      early failures are \"hidden\" by subsequent successful transfers.\n\n\t      Using this option, curl instead returns an error on the first\n\t      transfer that fails, independent of the amount of URLs that are\n\t      given on the command line. This way, no transfer failures go\n\t      undetected by scripts and similar.\n\n\t      This option does not imply -f, --fail, which causes transfers to\n\t      fail due to the server's HTTP status code. You can combine the\n\t      two options, however note -f, --fail is not global and is\n\t      therefore contained by -:, --next.\n\n\t      This option is global and does not need to be specified for each\n\t      use of --next.\n\n\t      Providing --fail-early multiple times has no extra effect.\n\t      Disable it again with --no-fail-early.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --fail-early https://example.com https://two.example\n\n\t      See also -f, --fail and --fail-with-body. Added in 7.52.0.\n\n       --fail-with-body\n\t      (HTTP) Return an error on server errors where the HTTP response\n\t      code is 400 or greater). In normal cases when an HTTP server\n\t      fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document stating\n\t      so (which often also describes why and more). This flag allows\n\t      curl to output and save that content but also to return error\n\t      22.\n\n\t      This is an alternative option to -f, --fail which makes curl\n\t      fail for the same circumstances but without saving the content.\n\n\t      Providing --fail-with-body multiple times has no extra effect.\n\t      Disable it again with --no-fail-with-body.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --fail-with-body https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -f, --fail and --fail-early. This option is mutually\n\t      exclusive to -f, --fail. Added in 7.76.0.\n\n       -f, --fail\n\t      (HTTP) Fail fast with no output at all on server errors. This is\n\t      useful to enable scripts and users to better deal with failed\n\t      attempts. In normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a\n\t      document, it returns an HTML document stating so (which often\n\t      also describes why and more). This flag prevents curl from\n\t      outputting that and return error 22.\n\n\t      This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where\n\t      non-successful response codes slip through, especially when\n\t      authentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).\n\n\t      Providing --fail multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it\n\t      again with --no-fail.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --fail https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --fail-with-body and --fail-early. This option is\n\t      mutually exclusive to --fail-with-body.\n\n       --false-start\n\t      (TLS) Tells curl to use false start during the TLS handshake.\n\t      False start is a mode where a TLS client starts sending\n\t      application data before verifying the server's Finished message,\n\t      thus saving a round trip when performing a full handshake.\n\n\t      This is currently only implemented in the Secure Transport (on\n\t      iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) backend.\n\n\t      Providing --false-start multiple times has no extra effect.\n\t      Disable it again with --no-false-start.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --false-start https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --tcp-fastopen.\n\n       --form-escape\n\t      (HTTP) Tells curl to pass on names of multipart form fields and\n\t      files using backslash-escaping instead of percent-encoding.\n\n\t      If --form-escape is provided several times, the last set value\n\t      is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --form-escape -F 'field\\name=curl' -F 'file=@load\"this' https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -F, --form. Added in 7.81.0.\n\n       --form-string <name=string>\n\t      (HTTP SMTP IMAP) Similar to -F, --form except that the value\n\t      string for the named parameter is used literally. Leading '@'\n\t      and '<' characters, and the ';type=' string in the value have no\n\t      special meaning. Use this in preference to -F, --form if there\n\t      is any possibility that the string value may accidentally\n\t      trigger the '@' or '<' features of -F, --form.\n\n\t      --form-string can be used several times in a command line\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --form-string \"data\" https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -F, --form.\n\n       -F, --form <name=content>\n\t      (HTTP SMTP IMAP) For HTTP protocol family, this lets curl\n\t      emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the submit\n\t      button. This causes curl to POST data using the Content-Type\n\t      multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388.\n\n\t      For SMTP and IMAP protocols, this is the means to compose a\n\t      multipart mail message to transmit.\n\n\t      This enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the\n\t      'content' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @\n\t      sign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix the file\n\t      name with the symbol <. The difference between @ and < is then\n\t      that @ makes a file get attached in the post as a file upload,\n\t      while the < makes a text field and just get the contents for\n\t      that text field from a file.\n\n\t      Tell curl to read content from stdin instead of a file by using\n\t      - as filename. This goes for both @ and < constructs. When stdin\n\t      is used, the contents is buffered in memory first by curl to\n\t      determine its size and allow a possible resend. Defining a\n\t      part's data from a named non-regular file (such as a named pipe\n\t      or similar) is not subject to buffering and is instead read at\n\t      transmission time; since the full size is unknown before the\n\t      transfer starts, such data is sent as chunks by HTTP and\n\t      rejected by IMAP.\n\n\t      Example: send an image to an HTTP server, where 'profile' is the\n\t      name of the form-field to which the file portrait.jpg is the\n\t      input:\n\n\t      curl -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi\n\n\t      Example: send your name and shoe size in two text fields to the\n\t      server:\n\n\t      curl -F name=John -F shoesize=11 https://example.com/\n\n\t      Example: send your essay in a text field to the server. Send it\n\t      as a plain text field, but get the contents for it from a local\n\t      file:\n\n\t      curl -F \"story=<hugefile.txt\" https://example.com/\n\n\t      You can also tell curl what Content-Type to use by using\n\t      'type=', in a manner similar to:\n\n\t      curl -F \"web=@index.html;type=text/html\" example.com\n\n\t      or\n\n\t      curl -F \"name=daniel;type=text/foo\" example.com\n\n\t      You can also explicitly change the name field of a file upload\n\t      part by setting filename=, like this:\n\n\t      curl -F \"file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost\" example.com\n\n\t      If filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by\n\t      double-quotes like:\n\n\t      curl -F \"file=@\\\"local,file\\\";filename=\\\"name;in;post\\\"\" example.com\n\n\t      or\n\n\t      curl -F 'file=@\"local,file\";filename=\"name;in;post\"' example.com\n\n\t      Note that if a filename/path is quoted by double-quotes, any\n\t      double-quote or backslash within the filename must be escaped by\n\t      backslash.\n\n\t      Quoting must also be applied to non-file data if it contains\n\t      semicolons, leading/trailing spaces or leading double quotes:\n\n\t      curl -F 'colors=\"red; green; blue\";type=text/x-myapp' example.com\n\n\t      You can add custom headers to the field by setting headers=,\n\t      like\n\n\t      curl -F \"submit=OK;headers=\\\"X-submit-type: OK\\\"\" example.com\n\n\t      or\n\n\t      curl -F \"submit=OK;headers=@headerfile\" example.com\n\n\t      The headers= keyword may appear more that once and above notes\n\t      about quoting apply. When headers are read from a file, Empty\n\t      lines and lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored; each\n\t      header can be folded by splitting between two words and starting\n\t      the continuation line with a space; embedded carriage-returns\n\t      and trailing spaces are stripped.  Here is an example of a\n\t      header file contents:\n\n\t      # This file contain two headers.\n\t      X-header-1: this is a header\n\n\t      # The following header is folded.\n\t      X-header-2: this is\n\t       another header\n\n\t      To support sending multipart mail messages, the syntax is\n\t      extended as follows:\n\n\t      - name can be omitted: the equal sign is the first character of\n\t      the argument,\n\n\t      - if data starts with '(', this signals to start a new\n\t      multipart: it can be followed by a content type specification.\n\n\t      - a multipart can be terminated with a '=)' argument.\n\n\t      Example: the following command sends an SMTP mime email\n\t      consisting in an inline part in two alternative formats: plain\n\t      text and HTML. It attaches a text file:\n\n\t      curl -F '=(;type=multipart/alternative' \\\n\t\t   -F '=plain text message' \\\n\t\t   -F '= <body>HTML message</body>;type=text/html' \\\n\t\t   -F '=)' -F '=@textfile.txt' ...  smtp://example.com\n\n\t      Data can be encoded for transfer using encoder=. Available\n\t      encodings are binary and 8bit that do nothing else than adding\n\t      the corresponding Content-Transfer-Encoding header, 7bit that\n\t      only rejects 8-bit characters with a transfer error,\n\t      quoted-printable and base64 that encodes data according to the\n\t      corresponding schemes, limiting lines length to 76 characters.\n\n\t      Example: send multipart mail with a quoted-printable text\n\t      message and a base64 attached file:\n\n\t      curl -F '=text message;encoder=quoted-printable' \\\n\t\t   -F '=@localfile;encoder=base64' ... smtp://example.com\n\n\t      See further examples and details in the MANUAL.\n\n\t      --form can be used several times in a command line\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --form \"name=curl\" --form \"file=@loadthis\" https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -d, --data, --form-string and --form-escape. This\n\t      option is mutually exclusive to -d, --data and -I, --head and\n\t      -T, --upload-file.\n\n       --ftp-account <data>\n\t      (FTP) When an FTP server asks for \"account data\" after user name\n\t      and password has been provided, this data is sent off using the\n\t      ACCT command.\n\n\t      If --ftp-account is provided several times, the last set value\n\t      is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --ftp-account \"mr.robot\" ftp://example.com/\n\n\t      See also -u, --user.\n\n       --ftp-alternative-to-user <command>\n\t      (FTP) If authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails,\n\t      send this command.  When connecting to Tumbleweed's Secure\n\t      Transport server over FTPS using a client certificate, using\n\t      \"SITE AUTH\" tells the server to retrieve the username from the\n\t      certificate.\n\n\t      If --ftp-alternative-to-user is provided several times, the last\n\t      set value is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --ftp-alternative-to-user \"U53r\" ftp://example.com\n\n\t      See also --ftp-account and -u, --user.\n\n       --ftp-create-dirs\n\t      (FTP SFTP) When an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses a path that\n\t      does not currently exist on the server, the standard behavior of\n\t      curl is to fail. Using this option, curl instead attempts to\n\t      create missing directories.\n\n\t      Providing --ftp-create-dirs multiple times has no extra effect.\n\t      Disable it again with --no-ftp-create-dirs.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --ftp-create-dirs -T file ftp://example.com/remote/path/file\n\n\t      See also --create-dirs.\n\n       --ftp-method <method>\n\t      (FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file on an\n\t      FTP(S) server. The method argument should be one of the\n\t      following alternatives:\n\n\t      multicwd\n\t\t     curl does a single CWD operation for each path part in\n\t\t     the given URL. For deep hierarchies this means many\n\t\t     commands. This is how RFC 1738 says it should be done.\n\t\t     This is the default but the slowest behavior.\n\n\t      nocwd  curl does no CWD at all. curl does SIZE, RETR, STOR etc\n\t\t     and give a full path to the server for all these\n\t\t     commands. This is the fastest behavior.\n\n\t      singlecwd\n\t\t     curl does one CWD with the full target directory and then\n\t\t     operates on the file \"normally\" (like in the multicwd\n\t\t     case). This is somewhat more standards compliant than\n\t\t     'nocwd' but without the full penalty of 'multicwd'."

This\n\t      option makes curl skip the verification step and proceed without\n\t      checking.\n\n\t      When this option is not used for protocols using TLS, curl\n\t      verifies the server's TLS certificate before it continues: that\n\t      the certificate contains the right name which matches the host\n\t      name used in the URL and that the certificate has been signed by\n\t      a CA certificate present in the cert store.  See this online\n\t      resource for further details: https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.html\n\n\t      For SFTP and SCP, this option makes curl skip the known_hosts\n\t      verification.  known_hosts is a file normally stored in the\n\t      user's home directory in the \".ssh\" subdirectory, which contains\n\t      host names and their public keys.\n\n\t      WARNING: using this option makes the transfer insecure.\n\n\t      When curl uses secure protocols it trusts responses and allows\n\t      for example HSTS and Alt-Svc information to be stored and used\n\t      subsequently. Using -k, --insecure can make curl trust and use\n\t      such information from malicious servers.\n\n\t      Providing --insecure multiple times has no extra effect.\n\t      Disable it again with --no-insecure.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --insecure https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --proxy-insecure, --cacert and --capath.\n\n       --interface <name>\n\t      Perform an operation using a specified interface. You can enter\n\t      interface name, IP address or host name. An example could look\n\t      like:\n\n\t      curl --interface eth0:1 https://www.example.com/\n\n\t      On Linux it can be used to specify a VRF, but the binary needs\n\t      to either have CAP_NET_RAW or to be run as root. More\n\t      information about Linux VRF:\n\t      https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/vrf.txt\n\n\t      If --interface is provided several times, the last set value is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --interface eth0 https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --dns-interface.\n\n       --ipfs-gateway <URL>\n\t      (IPFS) Specify which gateway to use for IPFS and IPNS URLs. Not\n\t      specifying this will instead make curl check if the IPFS_GATEWAY\n\t      environment variable is set, or if a \"~/.ipfs/gateway\" file\n\t      holding the gateway URL exists.\n\n\t      If you run a local IPFS node, this gateway is by default\n\t      available under \"http://localhost:8080\". A full example URL\n\t      would look like:\n\n\t      curl --ipfs-gateway http://localhost:8080 ipfs://bafybeigagd5nmnn2iys2f3doro7ydrevyr2mzarwidgadawmamiteydbzi\n\n\t      There are many public IPFS gateways. See for example:\n\t      https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/\n\n\t      WARNING: If you opt to go for a remote gateway you should be\n\t      aware that you completely trust the gateway. This is fine in\n\t      local gateways as you host it yourself. With remote gateways\n\t      there could potentially be a malicious actor returning you data\n\t      that does not match the request you made, inspect or even\n\t      interfere with the request. You will not notice this when using\n\t      curl. A mitigation could be to go for a \"trustless\" gateway.\n\t      This means you locally verify that the data. Consult the docs\n\t      page on trusted vs trustless:\n\t      https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/#trusted-vs-trustless\n\n\t      If --ipfs-gateway is provided several times, the last set value\n\t      is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --ipfs-gateway https://example.com ipfs://\n\n\t      See also -h, --help and -M, --manual. Added in 8.4.0.\n\n       -4, --ipv4\n\t      This option tells curl to use IPv4 addresses only when resolving\n\t      host names, and not for example try IPv6.\n\n\t      Providing --ipv4 multiple times has no extra effect.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --ipv4 https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --http1.1 and --http2. This option is mutually\n\t      exclusive to -6, --ipv6.\n\n       -6, --ipv6\n\t      This option tells curl to use IPv6 addresses only when resolving\n\t      host names, and not for example try IPv4.\n\n\t      Providing --ipv6 multiple times has no extra effect.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --ipv6 https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --http1.1 and --http2. This option is mutually\n\t      exclusive to -4, --ipv4.\n\n       --json <data>\n\t      (HTTP) Sends the specified JSON data in a POST request to the\n\t      HTTP server. --json works as a shortcut for passing on these\n\t      three options:\n\n\t      --data [arg]\n\t      --header \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n\t      --header \"Accept: application/json\"\n\n\t      There is no verification that the passed in data is actual JSON\n\t      or that the syntax is correct.\n\n\t      If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a\n\t      file name to read the data from, or a single dash (-) if you\n\t      want curl to read the data from stdin. Posting data from a file\n\t      named 'foobar' would thus be done with --json @foobar and to\n\t      instead read the data from stdin, use --json @-.\n\n\t      If this option is used more than once on the same command line,\n\t      the additional data pieces are concatenated to the previous\n\t      before sending.\n\n\t      The headers this option sets can be overridden with -H, --header\n\t      as usual.\n\n\t      --json can be used several times in a command line\n\n\t      Examples:\n\t       curl --json '{ \"drink\": \"coffe\" }' https://example.com\n\t       curl --json '{ \"drink\":' --json ' \"coffe\" }' https://example.com\n\t       curl --json @prepared https://example.com\n\t       curl --json @- https://example.com < json.txt\n\n\t      See also --data-binary and --data-raw. This option is mutually\n\t      exclusive to -F, --form and -I, --head and -T, --upload-file.\n\t      Added in 7.82.0.\n\n       -j, --junk-session-cookies\n\t      (HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this\n\t      option makes it discard all \"session cookies\". This has the same\n\t      effect as if a new session is started. Typical browsers discard\n\t      session cookies when they are closed down.\n\n\t      Providing --junk-session-cookies multiple times has no extra\n\t      effect.  Disable it again with --no-junk-session-cookies.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --junk-session-cookies -b cookies.txt https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -b, --cookie and -c, --cookie-jar.\n\n       --keepalive-time <seconds>\n\t      This option sets the time a connection needs to remain idle\n\t      before sending keepalive probes and the time between individual\n\t      keepalive probes. It is currently effective on operating systems\n\t      offering the \"TCP_KEEPIDLE\" and \"TCP_KEEPINTVL\" socket options\n\t      (meaning Linux, recent AIX, HP-UX and more).  Keepalive is used\n\t      by the TCP stack to detect broken networks on idle connections.\n\t      The number of missed keepalive probes before declaring the\n\t      connection down is OS dependent and is commonly 9 or 10. This\n\t      option has no effect if --no-keepalive is used.\n\n\t      If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.\n\n\t      If --keepalive-time is provided several times, the last set\n\t      value is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --keepalive-time 20 https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --no-keepalive and -m, --max-time.\n\n       --key-type <type>\n\t      (TLS) Private key file type. Specify which type your --key\n\t      provided private key is. DER, PEM, and ENG are supported. If not\n\t      specified, PEM is assumed.\n\n\t      If --key-type is provided several times, the last set value is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --key-type DER --key here https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --key.\n\n       --key <key>\n\t      (TLS SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide your\n\t      private key in this separate file. For SSH, if not specified,\n\t      curl tries the following candidates in order: \"~/.ssh/id_rsa\",\n\t      \"~/.ssh/id_dsa\", \"./id_rsa\", \"./id_dsa\".\n\n\t      If curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine pkcs11\n\t      is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to\n\t      specify a private key located in a PKCS#11 device. A string\n\t      beginning with \"pkcs11:\" is interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI. If a\n\t      PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the --engine option is set as\n\t      \"pkcs11\" if none was provided and the --key-type option is set\n\t      as \"ENG\" if none was provided.\n\n\t      If curl is built against Secure Transport or Schannel then this\n\t      option is ignored for TLS protocols (HTTPS, etc). Those backends\n\t      expect the private key to be already present in the keychain or\n\t      PKCS#12 file containing the certificate.\n\n\t      If --key is provided several times, the last set value is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --cert certificate --key here https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --key-type and -E, --cert.\n\n       --krb <level>\n\t      (FTP) Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level must be\n\t      entered and should be one of 'clear', 'safe', 'confidential', or\n\t      'private'. Should you use a level that is not one of these,\n\t      'private' is used.\n\n\t      If --krb is provided several times, the last set value is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --krb clear ftp://example.com/\n\n\t      See also --delegation and --ssl. --krb requires that the\n\t      underlying libcurl was built to support Kerberos.\n\n       --libcurl <file>\n\t      Append this option to any ordinary curl command line, and you\n\t      get libcurl-using C source code written to the file that does\n\t      the equivalent of what your command-line operation does!\n\n\t      This option is global and does not need to be specified for each\n\t      use of --next.\n\n\t      If --libcurl is provided several times, the last set value is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --libcurl client.c https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -v, --verbose.\n\n       --limit-rate <speed>\n\t      Specify the maximum transfer rate you want curl to use - for\n\t      both downloads and uploads. This feature is useful if you have a\n\t      limited pipe and you would like your transfer not to use your\n\t      entire bandwidth. To make it slower than it otherwise would be.\n\n\t      The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix is\n\t      appended.  Appending 'k' or 'K' counts the number as kilobytes,\n\t      'm' or 'M' makes it megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes it\n\t      gigabytes. The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For\n\t      example 1k is 1024. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.\n\n\t      The rate limiting logic works on averaging the transfer speed to\n\t      no more than the set threshold over a period of multiple\n\t      seconds.\n\n\t      If you also use the -Y, --speed-limit option, that option takes\n\t      precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to help\n\t      keeping the speed-limit logic working.\n\n\t      If --limit-rate is provided several times, the last set value is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      Examples:\n\t       curl --limit-rate 100K https://example.com\n\t       curl --limit-rate 1000 https://example.com\n\t       curl --limit-rate 10M https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --rate, -Y, --speed-limit and -y, --speed-time.\n\n       -l, --list-only\n\t      (FTP POP3 SFTP) (FTP) When listing an FTP directory, this switch\n\t      forces a name-only view. This is especially useful if the user\n\t      wants to machine-parse the contents of an FTP directory since\n\t      the normal directory view does not use a standard look or\n\t      format. When used like this, the option causes an NLST command\n\t      to be sent to the server instead of LIST.\n\n\t      Note: Some FTP servers list only files in their response to\n\t      NLST; they do not include sub-directories and symbolic links.\n\n\t      (SFTP) When listing an SFTP directory, this switch forces a\n\t      name-only view, one per line.  This is especially useful if the\n\t      user wants to machine-parse the contents of an SFTP directory\n\t      since the normal directory view provides more information than\n\t      just file names.\n\n\t      (POP3) When retrieving a specific email from POP3, this switch\n\t      forces a LIST command to be performed instead of RETR. This is\n\t      particularly useful if the user wants to see if a specific\n\t      message-id exists on the server and what size it is.\n\n\t      Note: When combined with -X, --request, this option can be used\n\t      to send a UIDL command instead, so the user may use the email's\n\t      unique identifier rather than its message-id to make the\n\t      request.\n\n\t      Providing --list-only multiple times has no extra effect.\n\t      Disable it again with --no-list-only.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --list-only ftp://example.com/dir/\n\n\t      See also -Q, --quote and -X, --request.\n\n       --local-port <num/range>\n\t      Set a preferred single number or range (FROM-TO) of local port\n\t      numbers to use for the connection(s). Note that port numbers by\n\t      nature are a scarce resource so setting this range to something\n\t      too narrow might cause unnecessary connection setup failures.\n\n\t      If --local-port is provided several times, the last set value is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --local-port 1000-3000 https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -g, --globoff.\n\n       --location-trusted\n\t      (HTTP) Like -L, --location, but allows sending the name +\n\t      password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This may or\n\t      may not introduce a security breach if the site redirects you to\n\t      a site to which you send your authentication info (which is\n\t      clear-text in the case of HTTP Basic authentication).\n\n\t      Providing --location-trusted multiple times has no extra effect.\n\t      Disable it again with --no-location-trusted.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --location-trusted -u user:password https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -u, --user.\n\n       -L, --location\n\t      (HTTP) If the server reports that the requested page has moved\n\t      to a different location (indicated with a Location: header and a\n\t      3XX response code), this option makes curl redo the request on\n\t      the new place. If used together with -i, --include or -I,\n\t      --head, headers from all requested pages are shown.\n\n\t      When authentication is used, curl only sends its credentials to\n\t      the initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a different host,\n\t      it does not get the user+password pass on. See also\n\t      --location-trusted on how to change this.\n\n\t      Limit the amount of redirects to follow by using the\n\t      --max-redirs option.\n\n\t      When curl follows a redirect and if the request is a POST, it\n\t      sends the following request with a GET if the HTTP response was\n\t      301, 302, or 303. If the response code was any other 3xx code,\n\t      curl resends the following request using the same unmodified\n\t      method.\n\n\t      You can tell curl to not change POST requests to GET after a 30x\n\t      response by using the dedicated options for that: --post301,\n\t      --post302 and --post303.\n\n\t      The method set with -X, --request overrides the method curl\n\t      would otherwise select to use.\n\n\t      Providing --location multiple times has no extra effect.\n\t      Disable it again with --no-location.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl -L https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --resolve and --alt-svc.\n\n       --login-options <options>\n\t      (IMAP LDAP POP3 SMTP) Specify the login options to use during\n\t      server authentication.\n\n\t      You can use login options to specify protocol specific options\n\t      that may be used during authentication. At present only IMAP,\n\t      POP3 and SMTP support login options. For more information about\n\t      login options please see RFC 2384, RFC 5092 and the IETF draft\n\t      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-earhart-url-smtp-00\n\n\t      Since 8.2.0, IMAP supports the login option \"AUTH=+LOGIN\". With\n\t      this option, curl uses the plain (not SASL) \"LOGIN IMAP\" command\n\t      even if the server advertises SASL authentication. Care should\n\t      be taken in using this option, as it sends your password over\n\t      the network in plain text. This does not work if the IMAP server\n\t      disables the plain \"LOGIN\" (e.g. to prevent password snooping).\n\n\t      If --login-options is provided several times, the last set value\n\t      is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --login-options 'AUTH=*' imap://example.com\n\n\t      See also -u, --user.\n\n       --mail-auth <address>\n\t      (SMTP) Specify a single address. This is used to specify the\n\t      authentication address (identity) of a submitted message that is\n\t      being relayed to another server.\n\n\t      If --mail-auth is provided several times, the last set value is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --mail-auth user@example.come -T mail smtp://example.com/\n\n\t      See also --mail-rcpt and --mail-from.\n\n       --mail-from <address>\n\t      (SMTP) Specify a single address that the given mail should get\n\t      sent from.\n\n\t      If --mail-from is provided several times, the last set value is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --mail-from user@example.com -T mail smtp://example.com/\n\n\t      See also --mail-rcpt and --mail-auth.\n\n       --mail-rcpt-allowfails\n\t      (SMTP) When sending data to multiple recipients, by default curl\n\t      aborts SMTP conversation if at least one of the recipients\n\t      causes RCPT TO command to return an error.\n\n\t      The default behavior can be changed by passing\n\t      --mail-rcpt-allowfails command-line option which makes curl\n\t      ignore errors and proceed with the remaining valid recipients.\n\n\t      If all recipients trigger RCPT TO failures and this flag is\n\t      specified, curl still aborts the SMTP conversation and returns\n\t      the error received from to the last RCPT TO command.\n\n\t      Providing --mail-rcpt-allowfails multiple times has no extra\n\t      effect.  Disable it again with --no-mail-rcpt-allowfails.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --mail-rcpt-allowfails --mail-rcpt dest@example.com smtp://example.com\n\n\t      See also --mail-rcpt. Added in 7.69.0.\n\n       --mail-rcpt <address>\n\t      (SMTP) Specify a single email address, user name or mailing list\n\t      name. Repeat this option several times to send to multiple\n\t      recipients.\n\n\t      When performing an address verification (VRFY command), the\n\t      recipient should be specified as the user name or user name and\n\t      domain (as per Section 3.5 of RFC 5321).\n\n\t      When performing a mailing list expand (EXPN command), the\n\t      recipient should be specified using the mailing list name, such\n\t      as \"Friends\" or \"London-Office\"."

In such a case curl first connects to the\n\t      SOCKS proxy and then connects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or\n\t      HTTPS proxy. Hence pre proxy.\n\n\t      The pre proxy string should be specified with a protocol://\n\t      prefix to specify alternative proxy protocols. Use socks4://,\n\t      socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request the specific\n\t      SOCKS version to be used. No protocol specified makes curl\n\t      default to SOCKS4.\n\n\t      If the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is\n\t      assumed to be 1080.\n\n\t      User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are\n\t      URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special\n\t      characters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.\n\n\t      If --preproxy is provided several times, the last set value is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --preproxy socks5://proxy.example -x http://http.example https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -x, --proxy and --socks5.

Specifying all or +all enables all\n\t      protocols on redirects, which is not good for security.\n\n\t      If --proto-redir is provided several times, the last set value\n\t      is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --proto-redir =http,https https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --proto.\n\n       --proto <protocols>\n\t      Tells curl to limit what protocols it may use for transfers.\n\t      Protocols are evaluated left to right, are comma separated, and\n\t      are each a protocol name or 'all', optionally prefixed by zero\n\t      or more modifiers. Available modifiers are:\n\n\t      +      Permit this protocol in addition to protocols already\n\t\t     permitted (this is the default if no modifier is used).\n\n\t      -      Deny this protocol, removing it from the list of\n\t\t     protocols already permitted.\n\n\t      =      Permit only this protocol (ignoring the list already\n\t\t     permitted), though subject to later modification by\n\t\t     subsequent entries in the comma separated list.\n\n\t      For example: --proto -ftps uses the default protocols, but\n\t      disables ftps\n\n\t      --proto -all,https,+http only enables http and https\n\n\t      --proto =http,https also only enables http and https\n\n\t      Unknown and disabled protocols produce a warning. This allows\n\t      scripts to safely rely on being able to disable potentially\n\t      dangerous protocols, without relying upon support for that\n\t      protocol being built into curl to avoid an error.\n\n\t      This option can be used multiple times, in which case the effect\n\t      is the same as concatenating the protocols into one instance of\n\t      the option."

If you are using a different SSL backend\n\t      you can try setting TLS 1.3 cipher suites by using the\n\t      --proxy-ciphers option.\n\n\t      If --proxy-tls13-ciphers is provided several times, the last set\n\t      value is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --proxy-tls13-ciphers TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 -x proxy https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --tls13-ciphers, --curves and --proxy-ciphers.

Added in 7.52.0.\n\n       -U, --proxy-user <user:password>\n\t      Specify the user name and password to use for proxy\n\t      authentication.\n\n\t      If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and do either\n\t      Negotiate or NTLM authentication then you can tell curl to\n\t      select the user name and password from your environment by\n\t      specifying a single colon with this option: \"-U :\".\n\n\t      On systems where it works, curl hides the given option argument\n\t      from process listings. This is not enough to protect credentials\n\t      from possibly getting seen by other users on the same system as\n\t      they still are visible for a moment before cleared. Such\n\t      sensitive data should be retrieved from a file instead or\n\t      similar and never used in clear text in a command line.\n\n\t      If --proxy-user is provided several times, the last set value is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --proxy-user name:pwd -x proxy https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --proxy-pass.\n\n       -x, --proxy [protocol://]host[:port]\n\t      Use the specified proxy.\n\n\t      The proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix. No\n\t      protocol specified or http:// it is treated as an HTTP proxy.\n\t      Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request a\n\t      specific SOCKS version to be used.\n\n\t      Unix domain sockets are supported for socks proxy. Set localhost\n\t      for the host part. e.g. socks5h://localhost/path/to/socket.sock\n\n\t      HTTPS proxy support works set with the https:// protocol prefix\n\t      for OpenSSL and GnuTLS (added in 7.52.0). It also works for\n\t      BearSSL, mbedTLS, rustls, Schannel, Secure Transport and wolfSSL\n\t      (added in 7.87.0).\n\n\t      Unrecognized and unsupported proxy protocols cause an error\n\t      (added in 7.52.0).  Ancient curl versions ignored unknown\n\t      schemes and used http:// instead.\n\n\t      If the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is\n\t      assumed to be 1080.\n\n\t      This option overrides existing environment variables that set\n\t      the proxy to use. If there is an environment variable setting a\n\t      proxy, you can set proxy to \"\" to override it.\n\n\t      All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy are\n\t      transparently converted to HTTP. It means that certain protocol\n\t      specific operations might not be available. This is not the case\n\t      if you can tunnel through the proxy, as one with the -p,\n\t      --proxytunnel option.\n\n\t      User and password that might be provided in the proxy string are\n\t      URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special\n\t      characters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.\n\n\t      The proxy host can be specified the same way as the proxy\n\t      environment variables, including the protocol prefix (http://)\n\t      and the embedded user + password.\n\n\t      When a proxy is used, the active FTP mode as set with -P,\n\t      --ftp-port, cannot be used.\n\n\t      If --proxy is provided several times, the last set value is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --proxy http://proxy.example https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --socks5 and --proxy-basic.\n\n       --proxy1.0 <host[:port]>\n\t      Use the specified HTTP 1.0 proxy. If the port number is not\n\t      specified, it is assumed at port 1080.\n\n\t      The only difference between this and the HTTP proxy option -x,\n\t      --proxy, is that attempts to use CONNECT through the proxy\n\t      specifies an HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of the default HTTP 1.1.\n\n\t      Providing --proxy1.0 multiple times has no extra effect.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --proxy1.0 -x http://proxy https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -x, --proxy, --socks5 and --preproxy.\n\n       -p, --proxytunnel\n\t      When an HTTP proxy is used -x, --proxy, this option makes curl\n\t      tunnel the traffic through the proxy. The tunnel approach is\n\t      made with the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and requires that the\n\t      proxy allows direct connect to the remote port number curl wants\n\t      to tunnel through to.\n\n\t      To suppress proxy CONNECT response headers when curl is set to\n\t      output headers use --suppress-connect-headers.\n\n\t      Providing --proxytunnel multiple times has no extra effect.\n\t      Disable it again with --no-proxytunnel.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --proxytunnel -x http://proxy https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -x, --proxy.\n\n       --pubkey <key>\n\t      (SFTP SCP) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your\n\t      public key in this separate file.\n\n\t      curl attempts to automatically extract the public key from the\n\t      private key file, so passing this option is generally not\n\t      required. Note that this public key extraction requires libcurl\n\t      to be linked against a copy of libssh2 1.2.8 or higher that is\n\t      itself linked against OpenSSL.\n\n\t      If --pubkey is provided several times, the last set value is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --pubkey file.pub sftp://example.com/\n\n\t      See also --pass.\n\n       -Q, --quote <command>\n\t      (FTP SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP or SFTP\n\t      server. Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer takes place\n\t      (just after the initial PWD command in an FTP transfer, to be\n\t      exact). To make commands take place after a successful transfer,\n\t      prefix them with a dash '-'.\n\n\t      (FTP only) To make commands be sent after curl has changed the\n\t      working directory, just before the file transfer command(s),\n\t      prefix the command with a '+'. This is not performed when a\n\t      directory listing is performed.\n\n\t      You may specify any number of commands.\n\n\t      By default curl stops at first failure. To make curl continue\n\t      even if the command fails, prefix the command with an asterisk\n\t      (*). Otherwise, if the server returns failure for one of the\n\t      commands, the entire operation is aborted.\n\n\t      You must send syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC 959\n\t      defines to FTP servers, or one of the commands listed below to\n\t      SFTP servers.\n\n\t      SFTP is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets SFTP\n\t      quote commands itself before sending them to the server. File\n\t      names may be quoted shell-style to embed spaces or special\n\t      characters. Following is the list of all supported SFTP quote\n\t      commands:\n\n\t      atime date file\n\t\t     The atime command sets the last access time of the file\n\t\t     named by the file operand. The <date expression> can be\n\t\t     all sorts of date strings, see the curl_getdate(3) man\n\t\t     page for date expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)\n\n\t      chgrp group file\n\t\t     The chgrp command sets the group ID of the file named by\n\t\t     the file operand to the group ID specified by the group\n\t\t     operand. The group operand is a decimal integer group ID.\n\n\t      chmod mode file\n\t\t     The chmod command modifies the file mode bits of the\n\t\t     specified file. The mode operand is an octal integer mode\n\t\t     number.\n\n\t      chown user file\n\t\t     The chown command sets the owner of the file named by the\n\t\t     file operand to the user ID specified by the user\n\t\t     operand. The user operand is a decimal integer user ID.\n\n\t      ln source_file target_file\n\t\t     The ln and symlink commands create a symbolic link at the\n\t\t     target_file location pointing to the source_file\n\t\t     location.\n\n\t      mkdir directory_name\n\t\t     The mkdir command creates the directory named by the\n\t\t     directory_name operand.\n\n\t      mtime date file\n\t\t     The mtime command sets the last modification time of the\n\t\t     file named by the file operand. The <date expression> can\n\t\t     be all sorts of date strings, see the curl_getdate(3) man\n\t\t     page for date expression details. (Added in 7.73.0)\n\n\t      pwd    The pwd command returns the absolute path name of the\n\t\t     current working directory.\n\n\t      rename source target\n\t\t     The rename command renames the file or directory named by\n\t\t     the source operand to the destination path named by the\n\t\t     target operand.\n\n\t      rm file\n\t\t     The rm command removes the file specified by the file\n\t\t     operand.\n\n\t      rmdir directory\n\t\t     The rmdir command removes the directory entry specified\n\t\t     by the directory operand, provided it is empty.\n\n\t      symlink source_file target_file\n\t\t     See ln."

Without this option, curl starts the next\n\t      transfer as fast as possible.\n\n\t      If given several URLs and a transfer completes faster than the\n\t      allowed rate, curl waits until the next transfer is started to\n\t      maintain the requested rate. This option has no effect when -Z,\n\t      --parallel is used.\n\n\t      The request rate is provided as \"N/U\" where N is an integer\n\t      number and U is a time unit.

If you want\n\t      the file saved in a different directory, make sure you change\n\t      the current working directory before invoking curl with this\n\t      option or use --output-dir.\n\n\t      The remote file name to use for saving is extracted from the\n\t      given URL, nothing else, and if it already exists it is\n\t      overwritten. If you want the server to be able to choose the\n\t      file name refer to -J, --remote-header-name which can be used in\n\t      addition to this option. If the server chooses a file name and\n\t      that name already exists it is not overwritten.\n\n\t      There is no URL decoding done on the file name.

Particularly useful\n\t      when wanting to issue HTTP requests without leading slash or\n\t      other data that does not follow the regular URL pattern, like\n\t      \"OPTIONS *\".\n\n\t      curl passes on the verbatim string you give it its the request\n\t      without any filter or other safe guards. That includes white\n\t      space and control characters.\n\n\t      If --request-target is provided several times, the last set\n\t      value is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --request-target \"*\" -X OPTIONS https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -X, --request. Added in 7.55.0.\n\n       -X, --request <method>\n\t      Change the method to use when starting the transfer.\n\n\t      curl passes on the verbatim string you give it its the request\n\t      without any filter or other safe guards. That includes white\n\t      space and control characters.\n\n\t      HTTP   Specifies a custom request method to use when\n\t\t     communicating with the HTTP server. The specified request\n\t\t     method is used instead of the method otherwise used\n\t\t     (which defaults to GET). Read the HTTP 1.1 specification\n\t\t     for details and explanations. Common additional HTTP\n\t\t     requests include PUT and DELETE, while related\n\t\t     technologies like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE and\n\t\t     more.\n\n\t\t     Normally you do not need this option. All sorts of GET,\n\t\t     HEAD, POST and PUT requests are rather invoked by using\n\t\t     dedicated command line options.\n\n\t\t     This option only changes the actual word used in the HTTP\n\t\t     request, it does not alter the way curl behaves. So for\n\t\t     example if you want to make a proper HEAD request, using\n\t\t     -X HEAD does not suffice. You need to use the -I, --head\n\t\t     option.\n\n\t\t     The method string you set with -X, --request is used for\n\t\t     all requests, which if you for example use -L, --location\n\t\t     may cause unintended side-effects when curl does not\n\t\t     change request method according to the HTTP 30x response\n\t\t     codes - and similar.\n\n\t      FTP    Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of LIST\n\t\t     when doing file lists with FTP.\n\n\t      POP3   Specifies a custom POP3 command to use instead of LIST or\n\t\t     RETR."

This option is mutually exclusive to -v, --verbose\n\t      and --trace-ascii.\n\n       --unix-socket <path>\n\t      (HTTP) Connect through this Unix domain socket, instead of using\n\t      the network.\n\n\t      If --unix-socket is provided several times, the last set value\n\t      is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --unix-socket socket-path https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --abstract-unix-socket.\n\n       -T, --upload-file <file>\n\t      This transfers the specified local file to the remote URL.\n\n\t      If there is no file part in the specified URL, curl appends the\n\t      local file name to the end of the URL before the operation\n\t      starts. You must use a trailing slash (/) on the last directory\n\t      to prove to curl that there is no file name or curl thinks that\n\t      your last directory name is the remote file name to use.\n\n\t      When putting the local file name at the end of the URL, curl\n\t      ignores what is on the left side of any slash (/) or backslash\n\t      (\\) used in the file name and only appends what is on the right\n\t      side of the rightmost such character.\n\n\t      Use the file name \"-\" (a single dash) to use stdin instead of a\n\t      given file.  Alternately, the file name \".\" (a single period)\n\t      may be specified instead of \"-\" to use stdin in non-blocking\n\t      mode to allow reading server output while stdin is being\n\t      uploaded.\n\n\t      If this option is used with a HTTP(S) URL, the PUT method is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      You can specify one -T, --upload-file for each URL on the\n\t      command line. Each -T, --upload-file + URL pair specifies what\n\t      to upload and to where. curl also supports \"globbing\" of the -T,\n\t      --upload-file argument, meaning that you can upload multiple\n\t      files to a single URL by using the same URL globbing style\n\t      supported in the URL.\n\n\t      When uploading to an SMTP server: the uploaded data is assumed\n\t      to be RFC 5322 formatted. It has to feature the necessary set of\n\t      headers and mail body formatted correctly by the user as curl\n\t      does not transcode nor encode it further in any way.\n\n\t      --upload-file can be used several times in a command line\n\n\t      Examples:\n\t       curl -T file https://example.com\n\t       curl -T \"img[1-1000].png\" ftp://ftp.example.com/\n\t       curl --upload-file \"{file1,file2}\" https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -G, --get, -I, --head, -X, --request and -d, --data.\n\n       --url-query <data>\n\t      (all) This option adds a piece of data, usually a name + value\n\t      pair, to the end of the URL query part. The syntax is identical\n\t      to that used for --data-urlencode with one extension:\n\n\t      If the argument starts with a '+' (plus), the rest of the string\n\t      is provided as-is unencoded.\n\n\t      The query part of a URL is the one following the question mark\n\t      on the right end.\n\n\t      --url-query can be used several times in a command line\n\n\t      Examples:\n\t       curl --url-query name=val https://example.com\n\t       curl --url-query =encodethis http://example.net/foo\n\t       curl --url-query name@file https://example.com\n\t       curl --url-query @fileonly https://example.com\n\t       curl --url-query \"+name=%20foo\" https://example.com\n\n\t      See also --data-urlencode and -G, --get. Added in 7.87.0.\n\n       --url <url>\n\t      Specify a URL to fetch. This option is mostly handy when you\n\t      want to specify URL(s) in a config file.\n\n\t      If the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as \"http://\" or\n\t      \"ftp://\" etc) then curl makes a guess based on the host. If the\n\t      outermost subdomain name matches DICT, FTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3 or\n\t      SMTP then that protocol is used, otherwise HTTP is used.\n\t      Guessing can be avoided by providing a full URL including the\n\t      scheme, or disabled by setting a default protocol (added in\n\t      7.45.0), see --proto-default for details.\n\n\t      To control where this URL is written, use the -o, --output or\n\t      the -O, --remote-name options.\n\n\t      WARNING: On Windows, particular file:// accesses can be\n\t      converted to network accesses by the operating system. Beware!\n\n\t      --url can be used several times in a command line\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl --url https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -:, --next and -K, --config.\n\n       -B, --use-ascii\n\t      (FTP LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also be\n\t      enforced by using a URL that ends with \";type=A\". This option\n\t      causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.\n\n\t      Providing --use-ascii multiple times has no extra effect.\n\t      Disable it again with --no-use-ascii.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl -B ftp://example.com/README\n\n\t      See also --crlf and --data-ascii.\n\n       -A, --user-agent <name>\n\t      (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server.\n\t      To encode blanks in the string, surround the string with single\n\t      quote marks. This header can also be set with the -H, --header\n\t      or the --proxy-header options.\n\n\t      If you give an empty argument to -A, --user-agent (\"\"), it\n\t      removes the header completely from the request. If you prefer a\n\t      blank header, you can set it to a single space (\" \").\n\n\t      If --user-agent is provided several times, the last set value is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl -A \"Agent 007\" https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -H, --header and --proxy-header.\n\n       -u, --user <user:password>\n\t      Specify the user name and password to use for server\n\t      authentication. Overrides -n, --netrc and --netrc-optional.\n\n\t      If you simply specify the user name, curl prompts for a\n\t      password.\n\n\t      The user name and passwords are split up on the first colon,\n\t      which makes it impossible to use a colon in the user name with\n\t      this option. The password can, still.\n\n\t      On systems where it works, curl hides the given option argument\n\t      from process listings. This is not enough to protect credentials\n\t      from possibly getting seen by other users on the same system as\n\t      they still are visible for a moment before cleared. Such\n\t      sensitive data should be retrieved from a file instead or\n\t      similar and never used in clear text in a command line.\n\n\t      When using Kerberos V5 with a Windows based server you should\n\t      include the Windows domain name in the user name, in order for\n\t      the server to successfully obtain a Kerberos Ticket. If you do\n\t      not, then the initial authentication handshake may fail.\n\n\t      When using NTLM, the user name can be specified simply as the\n\t      user name, without the domain, if there is a single domain and\n\t      forest in your setup for example.\n\n\t      To specify the domain name use either Down-Level Logon Name or\n\t      UPN (User Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\\user and\n\t      user@example.com respectively.\n\n\t      If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and perform\n\t      Kerberos V5, Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then you\n\t      can tell curl to select the user name and password from your\n\t      environment by specifying a single colon with this option: \"-u\n\t      :\".\n\n\t      If --user is provided several times, the last set value is used.\n\n\t      Example:\n\t       curl -u user:secret https://example.com\n\n\t      See also -n, --netrc and -K, --config.\n\n       --variable <[%]name=text/@file>\n\t      Set a variable with \"name=content\" or \"name@file\" (where \"file\"\n\t      can be stdin if set to a single dash (-)). The name is a case\n\t      sensitive identifier that must consist of no other letters than\n\t      a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or underscore. The specified content is then\n\t      associated with this identifier.\n\n\t      Setting the same variable name again overwrites the old contents\n\t      with the new.\n\n\t      The contents of a variable can be referenced in a later command\n\t      line option when that option name is prefixed with \"--expand-\",\n\t      and the name is used as \"{{name}}\" (without the quotes).\n\n\t      --variable can import environment variables into the name space.\n\t      Opt to either require the environment variable to be set or\n\t      provide a default value for the variable in case it is not\n\t      already set.\n\n\t      --variable %name imports the variable called 'name' but exits\n\t      with an error if that environment variable is not already set.\n\t      To provide a default value if the environment variable is not\n\t      set, use --variable %name=content or --variable %name@content.\n\t      Note that on some systems - but not all - environment variables\n\t      are case insensitive.\n\n\t      When expanding variables, curl supports a set of functions that\n\t      can make the variable contents more convenient to use. You apply\n\t      a function to a variable expansion by adding a colon and then\n\t      list the desired functions in a comma-separated list that is\n\t      evaluated in a left-to-right order. Variable content holding\n\t      null bytes that are not encoded when expanded, causes an error.\n\n\t      Available functions:\n\n\t      trim   removes all leading and trailing white space.\n\n\t      json   outputs the content using JSON string quoting rules.\n\n\t      url    shows the content URL (percent) encoded.\n\n\t      b64    expands the variable base64 encoded"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `curl`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nExample:\n\t       curl --version\n\n\t      See also -h, --help and -M, --manual.\n\n       -w, --write-out <format>\n\t      Make curl display information on stdout after a completed\n\t      transfer. The format is a string that may contain plain text\n\t      mixed with any number of variables. The format can be specified\n\t      as a literal \"string\", or you can have curl read the format from\n\t      a file with \"@filename\" and to tell curl to read the format from\n\t      stdin you write \"@-\".\n\n\t      The variables present in the output format are substituted by\n\t      the value or text that curl thinks fit, as described below. All\n\t      variables are specified as %{variable_name} and to output a\n\t      normal % you just write them as %%. You can output a newline by\n\t      using \\n, a carriage return with \\r and a tab space with \\t.\n\n\t      The output is by default written to standard output, but can be\n\t      changed with %{stderr} and %output{}.\n\n\t      Output HTTP headers from the most recent request by using\n\t      %header{name} where name is the case insensitive name of the\n\t      header (without the trailing colon). The header contents are\n\t      exactly as sent over the network, with leading and trailing\n\t      whitespace trimmed (added in 7.84.0).\n\n\t      Select a specific target destination file to write the output\n\t      to, by using %output{name} (added in curl 8.3.0) where name is\n\t      the full file name. The output following that instruction is\n\t      then written to that file. More than one %output{} instruction\n\t      can be specified in the same write-out argument. If the file\n\t      name cannot be created, curl leaves the output destination to\n\t      the one used prior to the %output{} instruction. Use\n\t      %output{>>name} to append data to an existing file.\n\n\t      NOTE: In Windows the %-symbol is a special symbol used to expand\n\t      environment variables. In batch files all occurrences of % must\n\t      be doubled when using this option to properly escape. If this\n\t      option is used at the command prompt then the % cannot be\n\t      escaped and unintended expansion is possible.\n\n\t      The variables available are:\n\n\t      `certs`\n\t\t     Output the certificate chain with details. Supported only\n\t\t     by the OpenSSL, GnuTLS, Schannel and Secure Transport\n\t\t     backends.

(Added in 7.83.0)\n\n\t\t     The header names provided in lowercase, listed in order\n\t\t     of appearance over the wire. Except for duplicated\n\t\t     headers. They are grouped on the first occurrence of that\n\t\t     header, each value is presented in the JSON array.\n\n\t      `http_code`\n\t\t     The numerical response code that was found in the last\n\t\t     retrieved HTTP(S) or FTP(s) transfer.\n\n\t      `http_connect`\n\t\t     The numerical code that was found in the last response\n\t\t     (from a proxy) to a curl CONNECT request.\n\n\t      `http_version`\n\t\t     The http version that was effectively used.

(Added in 7.75.0)\n\n\t      `proxy_ssl_verify_result`\n\t\t     The result of the HTTPS proxy's SSL peer certificate\n\t\t     verification that was requested. 0 means the verification\n\t\t     was successful. (Added in 7.52.0)\n\n\t      `redirect_url`\n\t\t     When an HTTP request was made without -L, --location to\n\t\t     follow redirects (or when --max-redirs is met), this\n\t\t     variable shows the actual URL a redirect would have gone\n\t\t     to.\n\n\t      `referer`\n\t\t     The Referer: header, if there was any.
