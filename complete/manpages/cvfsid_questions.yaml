For customers using client-based licensing, SNFS\n       identifiers are used to generate individual client licenses.  This\n       identifier string is submitted to Apple Technical Support for license\n       authorization keys.  See the installation instructions for additional\n       information on SNFS licensing.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -h, -? Display help\n\n       -G     Gather mode.  NOTE: Not intended for general use.  Only use when\n\t      recommended by Apple Support.\n\n       -l     List the local host's Authorizing IDs, IP addresses, and MACs.\n\t      (Linux only.)\n\n       -n     Display the network interface information in a compact, machine\n\t      readable form.
