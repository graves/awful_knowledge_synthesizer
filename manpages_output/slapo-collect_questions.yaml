In X.500, a\n       collective attribute is \"a user attribute whose values are the same for\n       each member of an entry collection\".\n\n       Collective attributes are added to entries returned by a search\n       operation when the entry is within the scope of the related ancestor.\n       Collective attributes can only be modified when the modification\n       affects the related ancestor.\n\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       This slapd.conf option applies to the collect overlay.  It should\n       appear after the overlay directive.\n\n       collectinfo <DN> <attrlist>\n\t      Specify the DN of the ancestor entry and the set of related\n\t      collective attributes, where attrlist is a comma-separated list\n\t      of attributes.  The DN should be within the naming context of\n\t      the database."
