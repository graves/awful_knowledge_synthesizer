- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `iwidgets_fileselectionbox`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The iwidgets::fileselectionbox command creates a file selection box\n       similar to the OSF/Motif standard Xmfileselectionbox composite widget.\n       The fileselectionbox is composed of directory and file scrolled lists\n       as well as filter and selection entry fields.  Bindings are in place\n       such that selection of a directory list item loads the filter entry\n       field and selection of a file list item loads the selection entry\n       field.  Options exist to control the appearance and actions of the\n       widget.\n\n\nMETHODS\n       The iwidgets::fileselectionbox command creates a new Tcl command whose\n       name is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various\n       operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The\n       following commands are possible for fileselectionbox widgets:\n\n\nWIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS\n       pathName cget option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::fileselectionbox command.\n\n       pathName childsite\n\t      Returns the child site widget path name.\n\n       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.\tIf no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list).\tIf option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t      given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty\n\t      string.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::fileselectionbox command.\n\n       pathName filter\n\t      Update the current contents of the file selection box based on\n\t      the current filter entry field value.\n\n       pathName get\n\t      Returns the current value of the selection entry widget."
