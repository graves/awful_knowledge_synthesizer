In this case, the widget will display no background or\n       border, and no colors will be consumed from its colormap for its\n       background and border.  [-class class] Specifies a class for the\n       window.\tThis class will be used when querying the option database for\n       the window's other options, and it will also be used later for other\n       purposes such as bindings.  The class option may not be changed with\n       the configure widget command.  [-colormap colormap] Specifies a\n       colormap to use for the window.\tThe value may be either new, in which\n       case a new colormap is created for the window and its children, or the\n       name of another window (which must be on the same screen and have the\n       same visual as pathName), in which case the new window will use the\n       colormap from the specified window.  If the colormap option is not\n       specified, the new window uses the same colormap as its parent.\tThis\n       option may not be changed with the configure widget command.\n       [-container container] The value must be a boolean.  If true, it means\n       that this window will be used as a container in which some other\n       application will be embedded (for example, a Tk toplevel can be\n       embedded using the -use option).  The window will support the\n       appropriate window manager protocols for things like geometry requests.\n       The window should not have any children of its own in this application.\n       This option may not be changed with the configure widget command.\n       [-height height] Specifies the desired height for the window in any of\n       the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels.  If this option is less than or\n       equal to zero then the window will not request any size at all.\n       [-labelanchor labelAnchor] Specifies where to place the label. A label\n       is only displayed if the -text option is not the empty string.  Valid\n       values for this option are (listing them clockwise) nw, n, ne, en, e,\n       es, se, s,sw, ws, w and wn.  The default value is nw.\n       [-labelwidget labelWidget] Specifies a widget to use as label. This\n       overrides any -text option. The widget must exist before being used as\n       -labelwidget and if it is not a descendant of this window, it will be\n       raised above it in the stacking order.  [-visual visual] Specifies\n       visual information for the new window in any of the forms accepted by\n       Tk_GetVisual.  If this option is not specified, the new window will use\n       the same visual as its parent.  The visual option may not be modified\n       with the configure widget command.  [-width width] Specifies the\n       desired width for the window in any of the forms acceptable to\n       Tk_GetPixels.  If this option is less than or equal to zero then the\n       window will not request any size at all.\n______________________________________________________________________________"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `labelframe`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The labelframe command creates a new window (given by the pathName\n       argument) and makes it into a labelframe widget.  Additional options,\n       described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option\n       database to configure aspects of the labelframe such as its background\n       color and relief.  The labelframe command returns the path name of the\n       new window.\n\n       A labelframe is a simple widget.  Its primary purpose is to act as a\n       spacer or container for complex window layouts.\tIt has the features of\n       a frame plus the ability to display a label.\n\nWIDGET COMMAND\n       The labelframe command creates a new Tcl command whose name is the same\n       as the path name of the labelframe's window.  This command may be used\n       to invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following\n       general form:\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n       PathName is the name of the command, which is the same as the\n       labelframe widget's path name.  Option and the args determine the exact\n       behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible for frame\n       widgets:"
