The overlapping lines from both files will\n\t     be inserted by the edit script, bracketed by \"<<<<<<\" and\n\t     \">>>>>>\" lines."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the diff3 utility?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use diff3 to compare three files and show all changes, including conflicts?
  manpageQuestion3: What command would you use to compare three files with diff3, treating all files as text and producing an easy-only edit script for file3?

  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the -m option with diff3 to generate a merge output instead of an ed script?
