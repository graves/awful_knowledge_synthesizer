This option is typically only useful\n\t      for debugging.\n\n     -help    Prints a usage message and exits.\n\n     -server list\n\t      The service will listen on each of the TCP ports specified in\n\t      the comma-separated list. This option is typically only used for\n\t      debugging.\n\n     nlcontrol supports the following commands:\n\n     reconfigure      Force the NETLOGON service to re-read its configuration\n\t\t      information. This is not necessary in normal operation,\n\t\t      since the NETLOGON service will detect relevant\n\t\t      configuration changes and re-establish the secure\n\t\t      channel automatically."
