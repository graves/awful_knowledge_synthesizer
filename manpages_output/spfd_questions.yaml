The\n       default port is 5970.\n\n       The --socket form listens on a UNIX domain socket that is created with\n       the specified filename.\tThe socket can be assigned specific user and\n       group ownership with the --socket-user and --socket-group options, and\n       specific filesystem permissions with the --socket-perms option.\n\n       Generally, spfd can be instructed with the --set-user and --set-group\n       options to drop root privileges and change to another user and group\n       before it starts listening for requests.\n\n       The --help form prints usage information for spfd.\n\nREQUEST\n       A request consists of a series of lines delimited by \\x0A (LF)\n       characters (or whatever your system considers a newline).  Each line\n       must be of the form key=value, where the following keys are required:\n\n       ip  The sender IP address.\n\n       sender\n\t   The envelope sender address (from the SMTP \"MAIL FROM\" command).\n\n       helo\n\t   The envelope sender hostname (from the SMTP \"HELO\" command).\n\nRESPONSE\n       spfd responds to query requests with similar series of lines of the\n       form key=value.\tThe most important response keys are:\n\n       result\n\t   The result of the SPF query:\n\n\t   pass      The specified IP address is an authorized mailer for the\n\t\t     sender domain/address.\n\n\t   fail      The specified IP address is not an authorized mailer for\n\t\t     the sender domain/address.\n\n\t   softfail  The specified IP address is not an authorized mailer for\n\t\t     the sender domain/address, however the domain is still in\n\t\t     the process of transitioning to SPF.\n\n\t   neutral   The sender domain makes no assertion about the status of\n\t\t     the IP address.\n\n\t   unknown   The sender domain has a syntax error in its SPF record.\n\n\t   error     A temporary DNS error occurred while resolving the sender\n\t\t     policy.  Try again later.\n\n\t   none      There is no SPF record for the sender domain.\n\n       smtp_comment\n\t   The text that should be included in the receiver's SMTP response.\n\n       header_comment\n\t   The text that should be included as a comment in the message's\n\t   \"Received-SPF:\" header.\n\n       spf_record\n\t   The SPF record of the envelope sender domain.\n\n       For the description of other response keys see Mail::SPF::Query.\n\n       For more information on SPF see <http://www.openspf.org>.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       A running spfd could be tested using the \"netcat\" utility like this:\n\n\t   $ echo -e \"ip=11.22.33.44\\nsender=user@pobox.com\\nhelo=spammer.example.net\\n\" | nc localhost 5970\n\t   result=neutral\n\t   smtp_comment=Please see http://spf.pobox.com/why.html?sender=user%40pobox.com&ip=11.22.33.44&receiver=localhost\n\t   header_comment=localhost: 11.22.33.44 is neither permitted nor denied by domain of user@pobox.com\n\t   guess=neutral\n\t   smtp_guess=\n\t   header_guess=\n\t   guess_tf=neutral\n\t   smtp_tf=\n\t   header_tf=\n\t   spf_record=v=spf1 ?all\n\nSEE ALSO\n       Mail::SPF::Query, <http://www.openspf.org>\n\nAUTHORS\n       This version of spfd was written by Meng Weng Wong\n       <mengwong+spf@pobox.com>.

  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the spfd tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you configure spfd to listen on a UNIX domain socket located at '/var/spf.sock' with specific permissions and ownership?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of how to test spfd using netcat to send an SPF query request and interpret the response?
