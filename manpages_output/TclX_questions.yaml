TclX extends Tcl's\n       capabilities by adding new commands to it, without changing the syntax\n       of standard Tcl.  Extended Tcl is a superset of standard Tcl and is\n       built alongside the standard Tcl sources.\n\n       Extended Tcl was created by Karl Lehenbauer and Mark Diekhans and is\n       freely redistributable for any use without license or fee.\n\n       Available since 1989, Extended Tcl, also known as TclX, not only adds\n       capabilities to Tcl, but has also been the source of many of the\n       capabilities of the baseline Tcl release, including arrays, files,\n       sockets, file events, and date and time handling, among others.\n\n       Extended Tcl introduces a set of new commands and a user-extensible\n       library of useful Tcl procedures, any of which can be automatically\n       loaded on the first attempt to execute it.\n\n       The command descriptions are separated into several sections:\n\n\t    • General Commands\n\n\t    • Debugging and Development Commands\n\n\t    • Unix Access Commands\n\n\t    • File Commands\n\n\t    • Network Programming Support\n\n\t    • File Scanning Commands\n\n\t    • Math Commands\n\n\t    • List Manipulation Commands\n\n\t    • Keyed Lists\n\n\t    • String and Character Manipulation Commands\n\n\t    • XPG/3 Message Catalog Commands\n\n\t    • Help Facility\n\n\t    • Tcl Loadable Libraries and Packages\n\nGENERAL COMMANDS\n       A set of general, useful Tcl commands, includes a command to begin an\n       interactive session with Tcl, a facility for tracing execution, and a\n       looping command.\n\n       dirs   This procedure lists the directories in the directory stack.\n\n       commandloop ?-async? ?-interactive on | off | tty? ?-prompt1 cmd?\n       ?-prompt2 cmd? ?-endcommand cmd?\n\n\t      Create an interactive command loop reading commands from stdin\n\t      and writing results to stdout.  Command loops are maybe either\n\t      be blocking or event oriented.  This command is useful for Tcl\n\t      scripts that do not normally converse interactively with a user\n\t      through a Tcl command interpreter, but which sometimes want to\n\t      enter this mode, perhaps for debugging or user configuration.\n\t      The command loop terminates on EOF.\n\n\t      The following options are available:\n\n\t      -async A command handler will be associated with stdin.  When\n\t\t     input is available on stdin, it will be read and\n\t\t     accumulated until a full command is available.  That\n\t\t     command will then be evaluated.  An event loop must be\n\t\t     entered for input to be read and processed.\n\n\t      -interactive on | off | tty\n\t\t     Enable or disable interactive command mode.  In\n\t\t     interactive mode, commands are prompted for and the\n\t\t     results of comments are printed.  The value maybe any\n\t\t     boolean value or tty.  If tty is used, interactive mode\n\t\t     is enabled if stdin is associated with a terminal or\n\t\t     terminal emulator.  The default is tty.\n\n\t      -prompt1 cmd\n\t\t     If specified, cmd\tis used is evaluate and its result\n\t\t     used for the main command prompt.\tIf not specified, the\n\t\t     command in tcl_prompt1 is evaluated to output the prompt.\n\t\t     Note the difference in behavior, cmd results is used,\n\t\t     while tcl_prompt1 outputs.  This is to allow for future\n\t\t     expansion to command loops that write to other than\n\t\t     stdout.\n\n\t      -prompt2 cmd\n\t\t     If specified, cmd is used is evaluate and its result used\n\t\t     for the secondary (continuation) command prompt.  If not\n\t\t     specified, the command in tcl_prompt2 is evaluated to\n\t\t     output the prompt.\n\n\t      -endcommand cmd\n\t\t     If specified, cmd is evaluated when the command loop\n\t\t     terminates.\n\n\t\t     In interactive mode, the results of set commands with two\n\t\t     arguments are not printed.\n\n\t\t     If SIGINT is configured to generate a Tcl error, it can\n\t\t     be used to delete the current command being type without\n\t\t     aborting the program in progress.\n\n       echo ?str ...?\n\t      Writes zero or more strings to standard output, followed by a\n\t      newline.\n\n       infox option\n\n\t      Return information about Extended Tcl, or the current\n\t      application.  The following infox command options are available:\n\n\t      version\n\t\t     Return the version number of Extended Tcl.  The version\n\t\t     number for Extended Tcl is generated by combining the\n\t\t     base version of the standard Tcl code with another number\n\t\t     indicating the version of Extended Tcl being used.\n\n\t      patchlevel\n\t\t     Return the patchlevel for Extended Tcl.\n\n\t      have_fchown\n\t\t     Return 1 if the fchown system call is available.  This\n\t\t     supports the -fileid option on the chown and chgrp\n\t\t     commands.\n\n\t      have_fchmod\n\t\t     Return 1 if the fchmod system call is available.  This\n\t\t     supports the -fileid option on the chmod command.\n\n\t      have_flock\n\t\t     Return 1 if the flock command defined,  0 if it is not\n\t\t     available.\n\n\t      have_fsync\n\t\t     Return 1 if the fsync system call is available and the\n\t\t     sync command will sync individual files.  0 if it is not\n\t\t     available and the sync command will always sync all file\n\t\t     buffers.\n\n\t      have_ftruncate\n\t\t     Return 1 if the ftruncate or chsize system call is\n\t\t     available.  If it is, the ftruncate command -fileid\n\t\t     option maybe used.\n\n\t      have_msgcats\n\t\t     Return 1 if XPG message catalogs are available, 0 if they\n\t\t     are not.  The catgets is designed to continue to function\n\t\t     without message catalogs, always returning the default\n\t\t     string.\n\n\t      have_posix_signals\n\t\t     Return 1 if Posix signals are available (block and\n\t\t     unblock options available for the signal command).  0 is\n\t\t     returned if Posix signals are not available.\n\n\t      have_signal_restart\n\t\t     Return 1 if restartable signals are available (-restart\n\t\t     option available for the signal command).\t0 is returned\n\t\t     if restartable signals are not available.\n\n\t      have_truncate\n\t\t     Return 1 if the truncate system call is available.  If it\n\t\t     is, the ftruncate command may truncate by file path.\n\n\t      have_waitpid\n\t\t     Return 1 if the waitpid system call is available and the\n\t\t     wait command has full functionality.  0 if the wait\n\t\t     command has limited functionality.\n\n\t      appname\n\t\t     Return the symbolic application name of the current\n\t\t     application linked with the Extended Tcl library.\tThe C\n\t\t     variable tclAppName must be set by the application to\n\t\t     return an application specific value for this variable.\n\n\t      applongname\n\t\t     Return a natural language name for the current\n\t\t     application. The C variable tclLongAppName must be set by\n\t\t     the application to return an application specific value\n\t\t     for this variable.\n\n\t      appversion\n\t\t     Return the version number for the current application.\n\t\t     The C variable tclAppVersion must be set by the\n\t\t     application to return an application-specific value for\n\t\t     this variable.\n\n\t      apppatchlevel\n\t\t     Return the patchlevel for the current application.  The C\n\t\t     variable tclAppPatchlevel must be set by the application\n\t\t     to return an application-specific value for this\n\t\t     variable.\n\n       for_array_keys var array_name code\n\t      This procedure performs a foreach-style loop for each key in the\n\t      named array.  The break and continue statements work as with\n\t      foreach.\n\n       for_recursive_glob var dirlist globlist code\n\t      This procedure performs a foreach-style loop over recursively\n\t      matched files.  All directories in dirlist are recursively\n\t      searched (breadth-first), comparing each file found against the\n\t      file glob patterns in globlist.  For each matched file, the\n\t      variable var is set to the file path and code is evaluated.\n\t      Symbolic links are not followed.\n\n       loop var first limit ?increment? body\n\t      Loop is a looping command, similar in behavior to the Tcl for\n\t      statement, except that the loop statement achieves substantially\n\t      higher performance and is easier to code when the beginning and\n\t      ending values of a loop are known, and the loop variable is to\n\t      be incremented by a known, fixed amount every time through the\n\t      loop.\n\n\t       The var argument is the name of a Tcl variable that will\n\t      contain the loop index.  The loop index is set to the value\n\t      specified by first.  The Tcl interpreter is invoked upon body\n\t      zero or more times, where var is incremented by increment every\n\t      time through the loop, or by one if increment is not specified.\n\t      Increment can be negative in which case the loop will count\n\t      downwards.\n\n\t      When var reaches limit, the loop terminates without a subsequent\n\t      execution of body.  For instance, if the original loop\n\t      parameters would cause loop to terminate, say first was one,\n\t      limit was zero and increment was not specified or was non-\n\t      negative, body is not executed at all and loop returns.\n\n\t      The first, limit and increment are integer expressions.  They\n\t      are only evaluated once at the beginning of the loop.\n\n\t      If a continue command is invoked within body then any remaining\n\t      commands in the current execution of body are skipped, as in the\n\t      for command.  If a break command is invoked within body then the\n\t      loop command will return immediately.  Loop returns an empty\n\t      string.\n\n       popd   This procedure pops the top directory entry from the directory\n\t      stack and make it the current directory.\n\n       pushd ?dir?\n\t      This procedure pushes the current directory onto the directory\n\t      stack and cd to the specified directory.\tIf the directory is\n\t      not specified, then the current directory is pushed, but remains\n\t      unchanged.\n\n       recursive_glob dirlist globlist\n\t      This procedure returns a list of recursively matches files.  All\n\t      directories in dirlist are recursively searched (breadth-first),\n\t      comparing each file found against the file glob patterns in\n\t      globlist.  Symbolic links are not followed.\n\n       showproc ?procname ...?\n\t      This procedure lists the definition of the named procedures.\n\t      Loading them if it is not already loaded.  If no procedure names\n\t      are supplied, the definitions of all currently loaded procedures\n\t      are returned.\n\n       try_eval code catch ?finally?\n\t      The try_eval command evaluates code in the current context.\n\n       If an error occurs during the evaluation and catch is not empty, then\n       catch is evaluated to handler the error.  The result of the command,\n       containing the error message, will be stored in a global variable\n       errorResult.  The global variables errorResult, errorInfo and errorCode\n       will be imported into the current scope, there is no need to execute a\n       global command.\tThe result of the catch command becomes the result of\n       the try_eval command.  If the error that caused the catch to be\n       evaluate is to be continued, the following command should be used:\n\t    error $errorResult $errorCode $errorInfo\n\n       If the finally argument is supplied and not empty, it is evaluated\n       after the evaluation of the code and the catch commands.  If an error\n       occurs during the evaluation of the finally command, it becomes the\n       result of the try_eval command.\tOtherwise, the result of either code\n       or catch is preserved, as described above.\n\nDEBUGGING AND DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS\n       This section contains information on commands and procedures that are\n       useful for developing and debugging Tcl scripts."

If value is not specified, then the current\n\t      value of attribute is returned.  All values are boolean. Some\n\t      attributes maybe only be gotten, not modified.  The following\n\t      attributes may be specified:\n\n       RDONLY The file is opened for reading only. (Get only)\n\n       WRONLY The file is opened for writing only.  (Get only)\n\n       RDWR   The file is opened for reading and writing.  (Get only)\n\n       READ   If the file is readable. (Get only).\n\n       WRITE  If the file is writable. (Get only).\n\n       APPEND The file is opened for append-only writes.  All writes will be\n\t      forced to the end of the file. (Get or set).\n\n       NONBLOCK\n\t      The file is to be accessed with non-blocking I/O.  See the read\n\t      system call for a description of how it affects the behavior of\n\t      file reads.\n\n       CLOEXEC\n\t      Close the file on an process exec.  If the execl command or some\n\t      other mechanism causes the process to do an exec, the file will\n\t      be closed if this option is set.\n\n       NOBUF  The file is not buffered. If set, then there no buffering for\n\t      the file.\n\n       LINEBUF\n\t      Output the file will be line buffered.

If SIGPIPE is enabled, then it\n\t      is sent if connection is broken and data is written to the\n\t      socket.  If SIGPIPE is ignored, an error is returned on the\n\t      write.  This attribute is valid only on sockets.\tBy default,\n\t      SIGPIPE is ignored in Tcl.\n\n\t      The NONBLOCK, NOBUF and LINEBUF are provided for compatibility\n\t      with older scripts.

The lock is either advisory or mandatory, depending\n\t      on the mode bits of the file.  The lock is placed beginning at\n\t      relative byte offset start for length bytes.  If start or length\n\t      is omitted or empty, zero is assumed.  If length is zero, then\n\t      the lock always extents to end of file, even if the file grows.\n\t      If origin is \"start\", then the offset is relative to the\n\t      beginning of the file. If it is \"current\", it is relative to the\n\t      current access position in the file.  If it is \"end\", then it is\n\t      relative to the end-of-file (a negative is before the EOF,\n\t      positive is after).  If origin is omitted, start is assumed.\n\n\t      The following options are recognized:\n\n\t      -read  Place a read lock on the file.  Multiple processes may be\n\t\t     accessing the file with read-locks.\n\n\t      -write Place a write lock on the file.  Only one process may be\n\t\t     accessing a file if there is a write lock.\n\n\t      -nowait\n\t\t     If specified, then the process will not block if the lock\n\t\t     can not be obtained.  With this option, the command\n\t\t     returns 1 if the lock is obtained and 0 if it is not.\n\n\t      See your system's fcntl system call documentation for full\n\t      details of the behavior of file locking.\tIf locking is being\n\t      done on ranges of a file, it is best to use unbuffered file\n\t      access (see the fcntl command).\n\n\t      The flock command is not available on Windows 95.

Each of the above keys indexes an\n\t      element of the array containing the data.\n\n\t      If only fileId is specified, the command returns the data as a\n\t      keyed list.\n\n\t      The following values may be returned only if explicitly asked\n\t      for, it will not be returned with the array or keyed list forms:\n\n\t      remotehost\n\t\t     If fileId is a TCP/IP socket connection, then a list is\n\t\t     returned with the first element being the remote host IP\n\t\t     address.  If the remote host name can be found, it is\n\t\t     returned as the second element of the list.  The remote\n\t\t     host IP port number is the third element.\n\n\t      localhost\n\t\t     If fileId is a TCP/IP socket connection, then a list is\n\t\t     returned with the first element being the local host IP\n\t\t     address.  If the local host name can be found, it is\n\t\t     returned as the second element of the list.  The local\n\t\t     host IP port number is the third element.\n\n       ftruncate [-fileid] file newsize\n\t      Truncate a file to have a length of at most newsize bytes.\n\n\t      If the option -fileid is specified, file is an open file\n\t      identifier, otherwise it is a file path.\n\n\t      This command is not available or not fully functional if the\n\t      underlying operating system support is not available.  The\n\t      command infox have_truncate will indicate if this command may\n\t      truncate by file path.  The command infox have_ftruncate will\n\t      indicate if this command may truncate by file id.\n\n\t      The -fileid option is not available on Windows.\n\n       lgets fileId ?varName?\n\t      Reads the next Tcl list from the file given by fileId and\n\t      discards the terminating newline character.  This command\n\t      differs from the gets command, in that it reads Tcl lists rather\n\t      than lines.  If the list contains newlines or binary data, then\n\t      that newline or bytes of zero will be returned as part of the\n\t      result.  Only a newline not quoted as part of the list indicates\n\t      the end of the list.  There is no corresponding command for\n\t      outputting lists, as puts will do this correctly.\n\n\t      If varName is specified, then the line is placed in the variable\n\t      by that name and the return value is a count of the number of\n\t      characters read (not including the newline).  If the end of the\n\t      file is reached before reading any characters then -1 is\n\t      returned and varName is set to an empty string.  If varName is\n\t      specified and an error occurs, what ever data was read will be\n\t      returned in the variable, however the resulting string may not\n\t      be a valid list.\n\n\t      If varName is not specified then the return value will be the\n\t      line (minus the newline character) or an empty string if the end\n\t      of the file is reached before reading any characters.  An empty\n\t      string will also be returned if a line contains no characters\n\t      except the newline, so eof may have to be used to determine what\n\t      really happened.\n\n\t      The lgets command maybe used to read and write lists containing\n\t      binary data, however translation must be set to lf or the data\n\t      maybe corrupted.\n\n\t      If lgets is currently supported on non-blocking files.\n\n       pipe ?fileId_var_r fileId_var_w?\n\t      Create a pipe.  If fileId_var_r and fileId_var_r are specified,\n\t      then pipe will set the a variable named fileId_var_r to contain\n\t      the fileId of the side of the pipe that was opened for reading,\n\t      and fileId_var_w will contain the fileId of the side of the pipe\n\t      that was opened for writing.\n\n\t      If the fileId variables are not specified, then a list\n\t      containing the read and write fileIdw is returned as the result\n\t      of the command.\n\n       read_file ?-nonewline? fileName\n\n       read_file fileName numBytes\n\t      This procedure reads the file fileName and returns the contents\n\t      as a string.  If -nonewline is specified, then the last\n\t      character of the file is discarded if it is a newline.  The\n\t      second form specifies exactly how many bytes will be read and\n\t      returned, unless there are fewer than numBytes bytes left in the\n\t      file; in this case, all the remaining bytes are returned.\n\n       select readfileIds ?writefileIds? ?exceptfileIds? ?timeout?\n\t      This command allows an Extended Tcl program to wait on zero or\n\t      more files being ready for for reading, writing, have an\n\t      exceptional condition pending, or for a timeout period to\n\t      expire.  readFileIds, writeFileIds, exceptFileIds are each lists\n\t      of fileIds, as returned from open, to query.  An empty list ({})\n\t      may be specified if a category is not used.\n\n\t      The files specified by the readFileIds list are checked to see\n\t      if data is available for reading. The writeFileIds are checked\n\t      if the specified files are clear for writing.  The exceptFileIds\n\t      are checked to see if an exceptional condition has occurred\n\t      (typically, an error).  The write and exception checking is most\n\t      useful on devices, however, the read checking is very useful\n\t      when communicating with multiple processes through pipes.\n\t      Select considers data pending in the stdio input buffer for read\n\t      files as being ready for reading, the files do.  not have to be\n\t      unbuffered.\n\n\t      Timeout is a floating point timeout value, in seconds.  If an\n\t      empty list is supplied (or the parameter is omitted), then no\n\t      timeout is set.  If the value is zero, then the select command\n\t      functions as a poll of the files, returning immediately even if\n\t      none are ready.\n\n\t      If the timeout period expires with none of the files becoming\n\t      ready, then the command returns an empty list.  Otherwise the\n\t      command returns a list of three elements, each of those elements\n\t      is a list of the fileIds that are ready in the read, write and\n\t      exception classes.  If none are ready in a class, then that\n\t      element will be the null list.  For example:\n\n\t\t      select {file3 file4 file5} {file6 file7} {} 10.5\n\n\t      could return\n\n\t\t      {file3 file4} {file6} {}\n\n\t      or perhaps\n\n\t\t      file3 {} {}\n\n\t      On Windows, only sockets can be used with the select command.\n\t      Pipes, as returned by the open command, are not supported.\n\n       write_file fileName string ?string...?\n\t      This procedure writes the specified strings to the named file.\n\nNETWORK PROGRAMMING SUPPORT\n       TclX provides functionality to complement the Tcl socket command.  The\n       host_info command is used to get information about a host by name or IP\n       address.  In addition, the fstat and fcntl commands provide options of\n       querying and controlling connected sockets.  To obtain the host name of\n       the system the local system, use the id host command.\n\n       host_info option host\n\t      Obtain information about an Internet host. The argument host can\n\t      be either a host name or an IP address.\n\n\t      The following subcommands are recognized:\n\n\t      addresses\n\t\t     Return the list of IP addresses for host.\n\n\t      official_name\n\t\t     Return official name for host.\n\n\t      aliases\n\t\t     Return the list of aliases for host.  (Note that these\n\t\t     are IP number aliases, not DNS CNAME aliases. See\n\t\t     ifconfig(2).)\n\nFILE SCANNING COMMANDS\n       These commands provide a facility to scan files, matching lines of the\n       file against regular expressions and executing Tcl code on a match.\n       With this facility you can use Tcl to do the sort of file processing\n       that is traditionally done with awk.  And since Tcl's approach is more\n       declarative, some of the scripts that can be rather difficult to write\n       in awk are simple to code in Tcl.\n\n       File scanning in Tcl centers around the concept of a scan context.  A\n       scan context contains one or more match statements, which associate\n       regular expressions to scan for with Tcl code to be executed when the\n       expressions are matched.\n\n       scancontext ?option?\n\t      This command manages file scan contexts.\tA scan context is a\n\t      collection of regular expressions and commands to execute when\n\t      that regular expression matches a line of the file.  A context\n\t      may also have a single default match, to be applied against\n\t      lines that do not match any of the regular expressions.\n\t      Multiple scan contexts may be defined and they may be reused on\n\t      multiple files.  A scan context is identified by a context\n\t      handle.  The scancontext command takes the following forms:\n\n       scancontext create\n\t      Create a new scan context.  The scanmatch command is used to\n\t      define patterns in the context.  A contexthandle is returned,\n\t      which the Tcl programmer uses to refer to the newly created scan\n\t      context in calls to the Tcl file scanning commands.\n\n       scancontext delete contexthandle\n\t      Delete the scan context identified by contexthandle, and free\n\t      all of the match statements and compiled regular expressions\n\t      associated with the specified context.\n\n       scancontext copyfile contexthandle ?filehandle?\n\t      Set or return the file handle that unmatched lines are copied\n\t      to.  (See scanfile).  If filehandle is omitted, the copy file\n\t      handle is returned.  If no copy file is associated with the\n\t      context, {} is returned.\tIf a file handle is specified, it\n\t      becomes the copy file for this context.  If filehandle is {},\n\t      then it removes any copy file specification for the context.\n\n       scanfile ?-copyfile copyFileId? contexthandle fileId\n\t      Scan the file specified by fileId, starting from the current\n\t      file position.  Check all patterns in the scan context specified\n\t      by contexthandle against it, executing the match commands\n\t      corresponding to patterns matched.\n\n\t      If the optional -copyfile argument is specified, the next\n\t      argument is a file ID to which all lines not matched by any\n\t      pattern (excluding the default pattern) are to be written.  If\n\t      the copy file is specified with this flag, instead of using the\n\t      scancontext copyfile command, the file is disassociated from the\n\t      scan context at the end of the scan.\n\n\t      This command does not work on files containing binary data\n\t      (bytes of zero).\n\n       scanmatch ?-nocase? contexthandle ?regexp? commands\n\n\t      Specify Tcl commands, to be evaluated when regexp is matched by\n\t      a scanfile command.  The match is added to the scan context\n\t      specified by contexthandle.  Any number of match statements may\n\t      be specified for a give context.\tRegexp is a regular expression\n\t      (see the regexp command).  If -nocase is specified as the first\n\t      argument, the pattern is matched regardless of alphabetic case.\n\n\t      If regexp is not specified, then a default match is specified\n\t      for the scan context.  The default match will be executed when a\n\t      line of the file does not match any of the regular expressions\n\t      in the current scancontext.\n\n\t      The array matchInfo is available to the Tcl code that is\n\t      executed when an expression matches (or defaults).  It contains\n\t      information about the file being scanned and where within it the\n\t      expression was matched.\n\n\t      matchInfo is local to the top level of the match command unless\n\t      declared global at that level by the Tcl global command.\tIf it\n\t      is to be used as a global, it must be declared global before\n\t      scanfile is called (since scanfile sets the matchInfo before the\n\t      match code is executed, a subsequent global will override the\n\t      local variable).\tThe following array entries are available:\n\n\t      matchInfo(line)\n\t\t     Contains the text of the line of the file that was\n\t\t     matched.\n\n\t      matchInfo(offset)\n\t\t     The byte offset into the file of the first character of\n\t\t     the line that was matched.\n\n\t      matchInfo(linenum)\n\t\t     The line number of the line that was matched. This is\n\t\t     relative to the first line scanned, which is usually, but\n\t\t     not necessarily, the first line of the file.

This is\n       normally used only during debugging, to insure that message catalogs\n       are being used.\tIf your Unix implementation does not have XPG/3\n       message catalog support, stubs will be compiled in that will create a\n       version of catgets that always returns the default string.  This allows\n       for easy porting of software to environments that don't have support\n       for message catalogs.\n\n       Message catalogs are global to the process, an application with\n       multiple Tcl interpreters within the same process may pass and share\n       message catalog handles.\n\n       catopen ?-fail | -nofail? catname\n\t      Open the message catalog catname.  This may be a relative path\n\t      name, in which case the NLSPATH environment variable is searched\n\t      to find an absolute path to the message catalog.\tA handle in\n\t      the form msgcatN is returned.  Normally, errors are ignored, and\n\t      in the case of a failed call to catopen, a handle is returned to\n\t      an unopened message catalog.  (This handle may still be passed\n\t      to catgets and catclose, causing catgets to simply return the\n\t      default string, as described above.  If the -fail option is\n\t      specified, an error is returned if the open fails.  The option\n\t      -nofail specifies the default behavior of not returning an error\n\t      when catopen fails to open a specified message catalog.  If the\n\t      handle from a failed catopen is passed to catgets, the default\n\t      string is returned.\n\n       catgets catHandle setnum msgnum defaultstr\n\t      Retrieve a message form a message catalog. CatHandle should be a\n\t      Tcl message catalog handle that was returned by catopen.\tSetnum\n\t      is the message set number, and msgnum is the message number. If\n\t      the message catalog was not opened, or the message set or\n\t      message number cannot be found, then the default string,\n\t      defaultstr, is returned.\n\n       catclose ?-fail | -nofail? cathandle\n\t      Close the message catalog specified by cathandle.  Normally,\n\t      errors are ignored.  If -fail is specified, any errors closing\n\t      the message catalog file are returned.  The option -nofail\n\t      specifies the default behavior of not returning an error.  The\n\t      use of -fail only makes sense if it was also specified in the\n\t      call to catopen.\n\n       mainloop\n\t      This procedure sets up a top-level event loop.  Events are\n\t      processed until there are no more active event sources, at which\n\t      time the process exits.  It is used to build event oriented\n\t      programs using the TclX shell in a style similar to that used\n\t      with wish.  If the global variable tcl_interactive exists and\n\t      has a true value an interactive command handler is started as\n\t      well.   If the command handler is terminated by an EOF, the\n\t      process will be exited.\n\nHELP FACILITY\n       The help facility allows one to look up help pages which where\n       extracted from the standard Tcl manual pages and Tcl scripts during Tcl\n       installation.  Help files are structured as a multilevel tree of\n       subjects and help pages.  Help files are found by searching directories\n       named help in the directories listed in the auto_path variable.\tAll of\n       the files in the list of help directories form a virtual root of the\n       help tree.  This method allows multiple applications to provide help\n       trees without having the files reside in the same directory.\n\n       The help facility can be accessed in two ways, as interactive commands\n       in the Extended Tcl shell or as an interactive Tk-based program (if you\n       have built Extended Tcl with Tk).\n\n       To run the Tk-based interactive help program:\n\n\t   tclhelp ?addpaths?\n\n       Where addpaths are additional paths to search for help directories.  By\n       default, only the auto_path used by tclhelp is search.  This will\n       result in help on Tcl, Extended Tcl and Tk.\n\n       The following interactive Tcl commands and options are provided with\n       the help package:\n\n       help\n\t      Help, without arguments, lists of all the help subjects and\n\t      pages under the current help subject.\n\n       help subject\n\t      Displays all of help pages and lower level subjects (if any\n\t      exist) under the subject subject.\n\n       help subject/helppage\n\t      Display the specified help page.\tThe help output is passed\n\t      through a simple pager if output exceeds 23 lines, pausing\n\t      waiting for a return to be entered.  If any other character is\n\t      entered, the output is terminated.\n\n       helpcd ?subject?\n\t      Change the current subject, which is much like the Unix current\n\t      directory.  If subject is not specified, return to the top-level\n\t      of the help tree.  Help subject path names may also include\n\t      ``..'' elements.\n\n       helppwd\n\t      Displays the current help subject.\n\n       help help | ?\n\t      Displays help on the help facility at any directory level.\n\n       apropos pattern\n\t      This command locates subjects by searching their one-line\n\t      descriptions for a pattern.  Apropos is useful when you can\n\t      remember part of the name or description of a command, and want\n\t      to search through the one-line summaries for matching lines.\n\t      Full regular expressions may be specified (see the regexp\n\t      command).\n\nTCL LOADABLE LIBRARIES AND PACKAGES\n       Extended Tcl supports standard Tcl tclIndex libraries and package\n       libraries. A package library file can contain multiple independent Tcl\n       packages.  A package is a named collection of related Tcl procedures\n       and initialization code.\n\n       The package library file is just a regular Unix text file, editable\n       with your favorite text editor, containing packages of Tcl source code.\n       The package library file name must have the suffix .tlib.  An index\n       file with the same prefix name and the suffix .tndx resides the same\n       directory as the .tlib file.  The .tndx will be automatically created\n       whenever it is out of date or missing (provided there is write access\n       to the directory).\n\n       The variable auto_path contains a list of directories that are searched\n       for libraries.  The first time an unknown command trap is take, the\n       indexes for the libraries are loaded into memory. If the auto_path\n       variable is changed during execution of a program, it will be re-\n       searched. Only the first package of a given name found during the\n       execution of a program is loaded.  This can be overridden with\n       loadlibindex command.\n\n       The start of a package is delimited by:\n\n\t      #@package: package_name proc1 ?..procN?\n\n       These lines must start in column one.  Everything between the\n       #@package: keyword and the next #@package: keyword or a #@packend\n       keyword, or the end of the file, becomes part of the named package.\n       The specified procedures, proc1..procN, are the entry points of the\n       package.  When a command named in a package specification is executed\n       and detected as an unknown command, all code in the specified package\n       will be sourced.  This package should define all of the procedures\n       named on the package line, define any support procedures required by\n       the package and do any package-specific initialization.\tPackages\n       declarations maybe continued on subsequent lines using standard Tcl\n       backslash line continuations.  The #@packend keyword is useful to make\n       sure only the minimum required section of code is sourced.  Thus for\n       example a large comment block at the beginning of the next file won't\n       be loaded.\n\n       Care should be taken in defining package_name, as the first package\n       found in the path by with a given name is loaded.  This can be useful\n       in developing new version of packages installed on the system.\n\n       For example, in a package source file, the presence of the following\n       line:\n\n\t      #@package: directory_stack pushd popd dirs\n\n       says that the text lines following that line in the package file up to\n       the next package line or the end of the file is a package named\n       directory_stack and that an attempt to execute either pushd, popd or\n       dirs when the routine is not already defined will cause the\n       directory_stack portion of the package file to be loaded.\n\nPACKAGE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT COMMANDS\n       Several commands are available for building and managing package\n       libraries.  Commands that are extended versions of the standard Tcl\n       library commands are listed here.  All of the standard Tcl library\n       management commands and variables are also supported.\n\n       auto_commands ?-loaders?\n\t      Lists the names of all known loadable procedures and commands\n\t      procedures.  If -loaders is specified, the command that will be\n\t      executed to load the command will also be returned.\n\n       buildpackageindex libfilelist\n\t      Build index files for package libraries.\tThe argument\n\t      libfilelist is a list of package libraries.  Each name must end\n\t      with the suffix .tlib.  A corresponding .tndx file will be\n\t      built.  The user must have write access to the directory\n\t      containing each library.\n\n       convert_lib tclIndex packagelib ?ignore?\n\t      Convert a Ousterhout style tclIndex index file and associate\n\t      source files into a package library packagelib.  If packagelib\n\t      does not have a .tlib extension, one will be added.  Any files\n\t      specified in tclIndex that are in the list ignore will be\n\t      skipped.\tFiles listed in ignore should just be the base file\n\t      names, not full paths.\n\n       loadlibindex libfile.tlib\n\t      Load the package library index of the library file libfile\n\t      (which must have the suffix .tlib).  Package library indexes\n\t      along the auto_path are loaded automatically on the first\n\t      demand_load; this command is provided to explicitly load\n\t      libraries that are not in the path.  If the index file (with a\n\t      .tndx suffix) does not exists or is out of date, it will be\n\t      rebuilt if the user has directory permissions to create it. If a\n\t      package with the same name as a package in libfile.tlib has\n\t      already been loaded, its definition will be overridden by the\n\t      new package.  However, if any procedure has actually been used\n\t      from the previously defined package, the procedures from\n\t      libfile.tlib will not be loaded.\n\n       auto_packages ?-location?\n\t      Returns a list of the names of all defined packages. If\n\t      -location is specified, a list of pairs of package name and the\n\t      .tlib path name, offset and length of the package within the\n\t      library.\n\n       auto_load_file file\n\t      Source a file, as with the source command, except search\n\t      auto_path for the file.\n\n       searchpath path file\n\t      Search all directories in the specified path, which is a Tcl\n\t      list, for the specified file.  Returns the full path name of the\n\t      file, or an empty string if the requested file could not be\n\t      found."
