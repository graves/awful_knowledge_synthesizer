[file]\n       ...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       xpath uses the XML::XPath perl module to make XPath queries to any XML\n       document.  The XML::XPath module aims to comply exactly to the XPath\n       specification at \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath\" and yet allows extensions\n       to be added in the form of functions.\n\n       The script takes any number of XPath pointers and tries to apply them\n       to each XML document given on the command line. If no file arguments\n       are given, the query is done using \"STDIN\" as an XML document.\n\n       When multiple queries exist, the result of the last query is used as\n       context for the next query and only the result of the last one is\n       output. The context of the first query is always the root of the\n       current document.\n\nOPTIONS\n   -q\n       Be quiet. Output only errors (and no separator) on stderr.\n\n   -n\n       Never use an external DTD, ie. instantiate the XML::Parser module with\n       'ParseParamEnt => 0'.\n\n   -s suffix\n       Place \"suffix\" at the end of each entry. Default is a linefeed.\n\n   -p prefix\n       Place \"prefix\" preceding each entry. Default is nothing.\n\nBUGS\n       The author of this man page is not very fluant in english. Please, send\n       him (fabien@tzone.org) any corrections concerning this text.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       XML::XPath\n\nLICENSE AND COPYRIGHT\n       This module is  copyright  2000 AxKit.com Ltd.

  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the xpath tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the xpath command to query an XML document for all elements with a specific XPath expression and display the results with a custom prefix?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the xpath command to perform multiple queries on an XML file, ensuring that only the final query's results are outputted?
