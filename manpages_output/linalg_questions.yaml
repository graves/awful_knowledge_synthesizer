Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `linalg`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n(There is no convenience procedure for this yet)\n\nREMARKS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION\n       There is a difference between the original LA package by Hume and the\n       current implementation. Whereas the LA package uses a linear list, the\n       current package uses lists of lists to represent matrices. It turns out\n       that with this representation, the algorithms are faster and easier to\n       implement.\n\n       The LA package was used as a model and in fact the implementation of,\n       for instance, the SVD algorithm was taken from that package. The set of\n       procedures was expanded using ideas from the well-known BLAS library\n       and some algorithms were updated from the second edition of J.C. Nash's\n       book, Compact Numerical Methods for Computers, (Adam Hilger, 1990) that\n       inspired the LA package.\n\n       Two procedures are provided to make the transition between the two\n       implementations easier: to_LA and from_LA. They are described above.\n\nTODO\n       Odds and ends: the following algorithms have not been implemented yet:\n\n       •      determineQR\n\n       •      certainlyPositive, diagonallyDominant\n\nNAMING CONFLICT\n       If you load this package in a Tk-enabled shell like wish, then the\n       command\n       namespace import ::math::linearalgebra\n       results in an error message about \"scale\". This is due to the fact that\n       Tk defines all its commands in the global namespace. The solution is to\n       import the linear algebra commands in a namespace that is not the\n       global one:\n\n       package require math::linearalgebra\n       namespace eval compute {\n\t   namespace import ::math::linearalgebra::*\n\t   ... use the linear algebra version of scale ...\n       }\n\n       To use Tk's scale command in that same namespace you can rename it:\n\n       namespace eval compute {\n\t   rename ::scale scaleTk\n\t   scaleTk .scale ...\n       }"
