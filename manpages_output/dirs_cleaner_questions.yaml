Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `dirs_cleaner`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDIRS_CLEANER(8) \t    System Manager's Manual\t       DIRS_CLEANER(8)\n\nNAME\n     dirs_cleaner â€“ remove contents of directories\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     dirs_cleaner path ...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The dirs_cleaner utility recursively deletes the entire contents of each\n     directory argument, while the directories themselves are not deleted. A\n     cleaned directory may be re-created in the process of cleaning; if so, it\n     gets a new inode number. Recursive traversals do not cross mount points.\n     Each directory is identified directly or via a symbolic link.\n\n     The dirs_cleaner utility exits with one of the following values:\n\n     0\t     Each input directory was successfully cleaned.\n\n     >0      An error occurred.\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t       February 8, 2021 \t\t    macOS 15.3"
