If the SA is not available in every\n\t     level, the kernel will ask the key exchange daemon to establish a\n\t     suitable SA.  default means the kernel consults the system wide\n\t     default for the protocol you specified, e.g. the esp_trans_deflev\n\t     sysctl variable, when the kernel processes the packet.  use means\n\t     that the kernel uses an SA if it's available, otherwise the\n\t     kernel keeps normal operation.  require means SA is required\n\t     whenever the kernel sends a packet matched with the policy.\n\t     unique is the same as require; in addition, it allows the policy\n\t     to match the unique out-bound SA.\tYou just specify the policy\n\t     level unique, racoon(8) will configure the SA for the policy.
