The device-path may be a path to a whole disk, such as\n     /dev/disk0, which contains Lightweight Volume Manager (LwVM) structures;\n     all HFS slices will be converted and LwVM replaced by a GPT partition map\n     with a single partition containing the APFS container.\n\n     The options are as follows:"
