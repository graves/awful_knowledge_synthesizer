If any\n       exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See\n       \"Reporting Bugs\" below.\n\nModules and Pragmata\n   Updated Modules and Pragmata\n       •   Errno has been upgraded from version 1.20_05 to 1.20_06.\n\n\t   Add -P to the pre-processor command-line on GCC 5.  GCC added extra\n\t   line directives, breaking parsing of error code definitions.  [GH\n\t   #14491] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14491>\n\n       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20150214 to\n\t   5.20150822.\n\n\t   Updated to cover the latest releases of Perl.\n\n       •   perl5db.pl has been upgraded from 1.44 to 1.44_01.\n\n\t   The debugger would cause an assertion failure.  [GH #14605]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14605>\n\nDocumentation\n   Changes to Existing Documentation\n       perlfunc\n\n       •   Mention that \"study()\" is currently a no-op.\n\n       perlguts\n\n       •   The OOK example has been updated to account for COW changes and a\n\t   change in the storage of the offset.\n\n       perlhacktips\n\n       •   Documentation has been added illustrating the perils of assuming\n\t   the contents of static memory pointed to by the return values of\n\t   Perl wrappers for C library functions doesn't change.\n\n       perlpodspec\n\n       •   The specification of the POD language is changing so that the\n\t   default encoding of PODs that aren't in UTF-8 (unless otherwise\n\t   indicated) is CP1252 instead of ISO-8859-1 (Latin1).\n\nUtility Changes\n   h2ph\n       •   h2ph now handles hexadecimal constants in the compiler's predefined\n\t   macro definitions, as visible in $Config{cppsymbols}.  [GH #14491]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14491>\n\nTesting\n       •   t/perf/taint.t has been added to see if optimisations with taint\n\t   issues are keeping things fast.\n\n       •   t/porting/re_context.t has been added to test that utf8 and its\n\t   dependencies only use the subset of the \"$1..$n\" capture vars that\n\t   Perl_save_re_context() is hard-coded to localize, because that\n\t   function has no efficient way of determining at runtime what vars\n\t   to localize.\n\nPlatform Support\n   Platform-Specific Notes\n       Win32\n\t   •   Previously, when compiling with a 64-bit Visual C++, every Perl\n\t       XS module (including CPAN ones) and Perl aware C file would\n\t       unconditionally have around a dozen warnings from hv_func.h.\n\t       These warnings have been silenced.  GCC (all bitness) and\n\t       32-bit Visual C++ were not affected.\n\n\t   •   miniperl.exe is now built with -fno-strict-aliasing, allowing\n\t       64-bit builds to complete with GCC 4.8. [GH #14556]\n\t       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14556>\n\nSelected Bug Fixes\n       •   Repeated global pattern matches in scalar context on large tainted\n\t   strings were exponentially slow depending on the current match\n\t   position in the string.  [GH #14238]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14238>\n\n       •   The original visible value of $/ is now preserved when it is set to\n\t   an invalid value.  Previously if you set $/ to a reference to an\n\t   array, for example, perl would produce a runtime error and not set\n\t   PL_rs, but Perl code that checked $/ would see the array reference.\n\t   [GH #14245] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14245>\n\n       •   Perl 5.14.0 introduced a bug whereby \"eval { LABEL: }\" would crash.\n\t   This has been fixed.  [GH #14438]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14438>\n\n       •   Extending an array cloned from a parent thread could result in\n\t   \"Modification of a read-only value attempted\" errors when\n\t   attempting to modify the new elements.  [GH #14605]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14605>\n\n       •   Several cases of data used to store environment variable contents\n\t   in core C code being potentially overwritten before being used have\n\t   been fixed.\t[GH #14476]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14476>\n\n       •   UTF-8 variable names used in array indexes, unquoted UTF-8 HERE-\n\t   document terminators and UTF-8 function names all now work\n\t   correctly.  [GH #14601]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14601>\n\n       •   A subtle bug introduced in Perl 5.20.2 involving UTF-8 in regular\n\t   expressions and sometimes causing a crash has been fixed.  A new\n\t   test script has been added to test this fix; see under \"Testing\".\n\t   [GH #14600] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14600>\n\n       •   Some patterns starting with \"/.*..../\" matched against long strings\n\t   have been slow since Perl 5.8, and some of the form \"/.*..../i\"\n\t   have been slow since Perl 5.18.  They are now all fast again.  [GH\n\t   #14475] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14475>\n\n       •   Warning fatality is now ignored when rewinding the stack.  This\n\t   prevents infinite recursion when the now fatal error also causes\n\t   rewinding of the stack.  [GH #14319]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14319>\n\n       •   \"setpgrp($nonzero)\" (with one argument) was accidentally changed in\n\t   Perl 5.16 to mean setpgrp(0).  This has been fixed.\n\n       •   A crash with \"%::=(); J->${\\\"::\"}\" has been fixed.  [GH #14790]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14790>\n\n       •   Regular expression possessive quantifier Perl 5.20 regression now\n\t   fixed.  \"qr/\"PAT\"{\"min,max\"}+\"\"/\" is supposed to behave identically\n\t   to \"qr/(?>\"PAT\"{\"min,max\"})/\".  Since Perl 5.20, this didn't work\n\t   if min and max were equal.  [GH #14857]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14857>\n\n       •   Code like \"/$a[/\" used to read the next line of input and treat it\n\t   as though it came immediately after the opening bracket.  Some\n\t   invalid code consequently would parse and run, but some code caused\n\t   crashes, so this is now disallowed.\t[GH #14462]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14462>\n\nAcknowledgements\n       Perl 5.20.3 represents approximately 7 months of development since Perl\n       5.20.2 and contains approximately 3,200 lines of changes across 99\n       files from 26 authors.\n\n       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there\n       were approximately 1,500 lines of changes to 43 .pm, .t, .c and .h\n       files.\n\n       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant\n       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to\n       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.20.3:\n\n       Alex Vandiver, Andy Dougherty, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chris 'BinGOs'\n       Williams, Craig A.

We're grateful to the entire CPAN\n       community for helping Perl to flourish.\n\n       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,\n       please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.\n\nReporting Bugs\n       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles\n       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug\n       database at https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at\n       http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.\n\n       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug\n       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a\n       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output\n       of \"perl -V\", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by\n       the Perl porting team.\n\n       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it\n       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please\n       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed\n       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core\n       committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues,\n       figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to\n       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is\n       supported.  Please only use this address for security issues in the\n       Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for an explanation of how to view exhaustive details\n       on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t      PERL5203DELTA(1)"
