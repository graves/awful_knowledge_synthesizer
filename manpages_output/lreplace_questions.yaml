If list   │\n       is empty, then first and last are ignored.\n\n       If first is less than zero, it is considered to refer to before the\n       first element of the list.  For non-empty lists, the element indicated\n       by first must exist or first must indicate before the start of the\n       list."

Each element argument\n       will become a separate element of the list.  If no element arguments\n       are specified, then the elements between first and last are simply\n       deleted.  If list is empty, any element arguments are added to the end\n       of the list.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Replacing an element of a list with another:\n\t      % lreplace {a b c d e} 1 1 foo\n\t      a foo c d e\n\n       Replacing two elements of a list with three:\n\t      % lreplace {a b c d e} 1 2 three more elements\n\t      a three more elements d e\n\n       Deleting the last element from a list in a variable:\n\t      % set var {a b c d e}\n\t      a b c d e\n\t      % set var [lreplace $var end end]\n\t      a b c d\n\n       A procedure to delete a given element from a list:\n\t      proc lremove {listVariable value} {\n\t\t  upvar 1 $listVariable var\n\t\t  set idx [lsearch -exact $var $value]\n\t\t  set var [lreplace $var $idx $idx]\n\t      }"
