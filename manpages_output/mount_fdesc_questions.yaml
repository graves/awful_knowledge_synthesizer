The\n     conventional mount point is /dev and the filesystem should be union\n     mounted in order to augment, rather than replace, the existing entries in\n     /dev.  This command is normally executed by mount(8) at boot time.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -o      Options are specified with a -o flag followed by a comma\n\t     separated string of options.  See the mount(8) man page for\n\t     possible options and their meanings.\n\n     The contents of the mount point are fd, stderr, stdin, stdout and tty.\n\n     fd is a directory whose contents appear as a list of numbered files which\n     correspond to the open files of the process reading the directory.  The\n     files /dev/fd/0 through /dev/fd/# refer to file descriptors which can be\n     accessed through the file system.\tIf the file descriptor is open and the\n     mode the file is being opened with is a subset of the mode of the\n     existing descriptor, the call:"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `mount_fdesc`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nfd = open(\"/dev/fd/0\", mode);\n\n     and the call:\n\n\t   fd = fcntl(0, F_DUPFD, 0);\n\n     are equivalent.\n\n     The files /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and /dev/stderr appear as symlinks to\n     the relevant entry in the /dev/fd sub-directory.  Opening them is\n     equivalent to the following calls:\n\n\t   fd = fcntl(STDIN_FILENO,  F_DUPFD, 0);\n\t   fd = fcntl(STDOUT_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0);\n\t   fd = fcntl(STDERR_FILENO, F_DUPFD, 0);\n\n     Flags to the open(2) call other than O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY and O_RDWR are\n     ignored.\n\n     The /dev/tty entry is an indirect reference to the current process's\n     controlling terminal.  It appears as a named pipe (FIFO) but behaves in\n     exactly the same way as the real controlling terminal device.\n\nFILES\n     /dev/fd/#\n     /dev/stdin\n     /dev/stdout\n     /dev/stderr\n     /dev/tty\n\nSEE ALSO\n     mount(2), unmount(2), tty(4), fstab(5), mount(8)\n\nCAVEATS\n     No ~.  and .. entries appear when listing the contents of the /dev/fd\n     directory.  This makes sense in the context of this filesystem, but is\n     inconsistent with usual filesystem conventions.  However, it is still\n     possible to refer to both ~.  and .. in a pathname."
