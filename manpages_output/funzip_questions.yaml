See DESCRIPTION\n\t      for more details.\n\n       [input[.zip|.gz]]\n\t      Optional input archive file specification. See DESCRIPTION for\n\t      details.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       funzip without a file argument acts as a filter; that is, it assumes\n       that a ZIP archive (or a gzip'd(1) file) is being piped into standard\n       input, and it extracts the first member from the archive to stdout.\n       When stdin comes from a tty device, funzip assumes that this cannot be\n       a stream of (binary) compressed data and shows a short help text,\n       instead.  If there is a file argument, then input is read from the\n       specified file instead of from stdin.\n\n       A password for encrypted zip files can be specified on the command line\n       (preceding the file name, if any) by prefixing the password with a\n       dash.  Note that this constitutes a security risk on many systems;\n       currently running processes are often visible via simple commands\n       (e.g., ps(1) under Unix), and command-line histories can be read.  If\n       the first entry of the zip file is encrypted and no password is\n       specified on the command line, then the user is prompted for a password\n       and the password is not echoed on the console."

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `funzip`.



    Manpage text:

    Given the limitation on single-member extraction, funzip is most useful
           in conjunction with a secondary archiver program such as tar(1).  The
           following section includes an example illustrating this usage in the
           case of disk backups to tape.

    EXAMPLES
           To use funzip to extract the first member file of the archive test.zip
           and to pipe it into more(1):

           funzip test.zip | more

           To use funzip to test the first member file of test.zip (any errors
           will be reported on standard error):

           funzip test.zip > /dev/null

           To use zip and funzip in place of compress(1) and zcat(1) (or gzip(1L)
           and gzcat(1L)) for tape backups:

           tar cf - . | zip -7 | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=8k
           dd if=/dev/nrst0 ibs=8k | funzip | tar xf -

           (where, for example, nrst0 is a SCSI tape drive).

    BUGS
           When piping an encrypted file into more and allowing funzip to prompt
           for password, the terminal may sometimes be reset to a non-echo mode.
           This is apparently due to a race condition between the two programs;
           funzip changes the terminal mode to non-echo before more reads its
           state, and more then ``restores'' the terminal to this mode before
           exiting.  To recover, run funzip on the same file but redirect to
           /dev/null rather than piping into more; after prompting again for the
           password, funzip will reset the terminal properly.
