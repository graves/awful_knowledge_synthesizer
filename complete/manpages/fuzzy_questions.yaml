It\n       does so by allowing for a small margin that is determined automatically\n       - the margin is three times the \"epsilon\" value, that is three times\n       the smallest number eps such that 1.0 and 1.0+$eps canbe distinguished.\n       In Tcl, which uses double precision floating-point numbers, this is\n       typically 1.1e-16.\n\nPROCEDURES\n       Effectively the package provides the following procedures:\n\n       ::math::fuzzy::teq value1 value2\n\t      Compares two floating-point numbers and returns 1 if their\n\t      values fall within a small range. Otherwise it returns 0.\n\n       ::math::fuzzy::tne value1 value2\n\t      Returns the negation, that is, if the difference is larger than\n\t      the margin, it returns 1.\n\n       ::math::fuzzy::tge value1 value2\n\t      Compares two floating-point numbers and returns 1 if their\n\t      values either fall within a small range or if the first number\n\t      is larger than the second. Otherwise it returns 0.\n\n       ::math::fuzzy::tle value1 value2\n\t      Returns 1 if the two numbers are equal according to [teq] or if\n\t      the first is smaller than the second.\n\n       ::math::fuzzy::tlt value1 value2\n\t      Returns the opposite of [tge].\n\n       ::math::fuzzy::tgt value1 value2\n\t      Returns the opposite of [tle].\n\n       ::math::fuzzy::tfloor value\n\t      Returns the integer number that is lower or equal to the given\n\t      floating-point number, within a well-defined tolerance.\n\n       ::math::fuzzy::tceil value\n\t      Returns the integer number that is greater or equal to the given\n\t      floating-point number, within a well-defined tolerance.\n\n       ::math::fuzzy::tround value\n\t      Rounds the floating-point number off.\n\n       ::math::fuzzy::troundn value ndigits\n\t      Rounds the floating-point number off to the specified number of\n\t      decimals (Pro memorie).\n\n       Usage:\n\n       if { [teq $x $y] } { puts \"x == y\" }\n       if { [tne $x $y] } { puts \"x != y\" }\n       if { [tge $x $y] } { puts \"x >= y\" }\n       if { [tgt $x $y] } { puts \"x > y\" }\n       if { [tlt $x $y] } { puts \"x < y\" }\n       if { [tle $x $y] } { puts \"x <= y\" }\n\n       set fx\t   [tfloor $x]\n       set fc\t   [tceil  $x]\n       set rounded [tround $x]\n       set roundn  [troundn $x $nodigits]"

It too\n\t      fails.\n\n       The conclusion from this is that any expression should be surrounded by\n       braces, because otherwise very awkward things can happen if you need\n       accuracy. Furthermore, accuracy and understandable results are enhanced\n       by using these \"tolerant\" or fuzzy comparisons.\n\n       Note that besides the Tcl-only package, there is also a C-based\n       version.\n\nREFERENCES\n       Original implementation in Fortran by dr.
