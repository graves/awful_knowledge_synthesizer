Write JSON format\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       package require Tcl  8.5\n\n       package require pt::peg::export::json  ?1?\n\n       package require pt::peg::to::json\n\n       export serial configuration\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Are you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This package implements the parsing expression grammar export plugin\n       for the generation of JSON markup.\n\n       It resides in the Export section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools and\n       is intended to be used by pt::peg::export, the export manager, sitting\n       between it and the corresponding core conversion functionality provided\n       by pt::peg::to::json.\n\n       IMAGE: arch_core_eplugins\n\n       While the direct use of this package with a regular interpreter is\n       possible, this is strongly disrecommended and requires a number of\n       contortions to provide the expected environment.  The proper way to use\n       this functionality depends on the situation:\n\n       [1]    In an untrusted environment the proper access is through the\n\t      package pt::peg::export and the export manager objects it\n\t      provides.\n\n       [2]    In a trusted environment however simply use the package\n\t      pt::peg::to::json and access the core conversion functionality\n\t      directly.\n\nAPI\n       The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the\n       Plugin API found in the Parser Tools Export API specification.\n\n       export serial configuration\n\t      This command takes the canonical serialization of a parsing\n\t      expression grammar, as specified in section PEG serialization\n\t      format, and contained in serial, the configuration, a\n\t      dictionary, and generates JSON markup encoding the grammar.  The\n\t      created string is then returned as the result of the command.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       The JSON export plugin recognizes the following configuration variables\n       and changes its behaviour as they specify.\n\n       boolean indented\n\t      If this flag is set the plugin will break the generated JSON\n\t      code across lines and indent it according to its inner\n\t      structure, with each key of a dictionary on a separate line.\n\n\t      If this flag is not set (the default), the whole JSON object\n\t      will be written on a single line, with minimum spacing between\n\t      all elements.\n\n       boolean aligned\n\t      If this flag is set the generator ensures that the values for\n\t      the keys in a dictionary are vertically aligned with each other,\n\t      for a nice table effect. To make this work this also implies\n\t      that indented is set.\n\n\t      If this flag is not set (the default), the output is formatted\n\t      as per the value of indented, without trying to align the values\n\t      for dictionary keys.\n\n       Note that this plugin ignores the standard configuration variables\n       user, format, file, and name, and their values.\n\nJSON GRAMMAR EXCHANGE FORMAT\n       The json format for parsing expression grammars was written as a data\n       exchange format not bound to Tcl. It was defined to allow the exchange\n       of grammars with PackRat/PEG based parser generators for other\n       languages.\n\n       It is formally specified by the rules below:\n\n       [1]    The JSON of any PEG is a JSON object.\n\n       [2]    This object holds a single key, pt::grammar::peg, and its value.\n\t      This value holds the contents of the grammar.\n\n       [3]    The contents of the grammar are a JSON object holding the set of\n\t      nonterminal symbols and the starting expression. The relevant\n\t      keys and their values are\n\n\t      rules  The value is a JSON object whose keys are the names of\n\t\t     the nonterminal symbols known to the grammar.\n\n\t\t     [1]    Each nonterminal symbol may occur only once.\n\n\t\t     [2]    The empty string is not a legal nonterminal\n\t\t\t    symbol.\n\n\t\t     [3]    The value for each symbol is a JSON object itself.\n\t\t\t    The relevant keys and their values in this\n\t\t\t    dictionary are\n\n\t\t\t    is\t   The value is a JSON string holding the Tcl\n\t\t\t\t   serialization of the parsing expression\n\t\t\t\t   describing the symbols sentennial\n\t\t\t\t   structure, as specified in the section PE\n\t\t\t\t   serialization format.\n\n\t\t\t    mode   The value is a JSON holding holding one of\n\t\t\t\t   three values specifying how a parser should\n\t\t\t\t   handle the semantic value produced by the\n\t\t\t\t   symbol.\n\n\t\t\t\t   value  The semantic value of the\n\t\t\t\t\t  nonterminal symbol is an abstract\n\t\t\t\t\t  syntax tree consisting of a single\n\t\t\t\t\t  node node for the nonterminal\n\t\t\t\t\t  itself, which has the ASTs of the\n\t\t\t\t\t  symbol's right hand side as its\n\t\t\t\t\t  children.\n\n\t\t\t\t   leaf   The semantic value of the\n\t\t\t\t\t  nonterminal symbol is an abstract\n\t\t\t\t\t  syntax tree consisting of a single\n\t\t\t\t\t  node node for the nonterminal,\n\t\t\t\t\t  without any children. Any ASTs\n\t\t\t\t\t  generated by the symbol's right hand\n\t\t\t\t\t  side are discarded.\n\n\t\t\t\t   void   The nonterminal has no semantic\n\t\t\t\t\t  value. Any ASTs generated by the\n\t\t\t\t\t  symbol's right hand side are\n\t\t\t\t\t  discarded (as well).\n\n\t      start  The value is a JSON string holding the Tcl serialization\n\t\t     of the start parsing expression of the grammar, as\n\t\t     specified in the section PE serialization format.\n\n       [4]    The terminal symbols of the grammar are specified implicitly as\n\t      the set of all terminal symbols used in the start expression and\n\t      on the RHS of the grammar rules.\n\n       As an aside to the advanced reader, this is pretty much the same as the\n       Tcl serialization of PE grammars, as specified in section PEG\n       serialization format, except that the Tcl dictionaries and lists of\n       that format are mapped to JSON objects and arrays. Only the parsing\n       expressions themselves are not translated further, but kept as JSON\n       strings containing a nested Tcl list, and there is no concept of\n       canonicity for the JSON either.\n\n   EXAMPLE\n       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions"

This is a\n\t\t\t    custom extension of PEs based on Tcl's builtin\n\t\t\t    command regexp.\n\n\t\t     [17]   The expression [list t x] is an atomic parsing\n\t\t\t    expression. It matches the terminal string x.\n\n\t\t     [18]   The expression [list n A] is an atomic parsing\n\t\t\t    expression. It matches the nonterminal A.\n\n\t      Combined Parsing Expressions\n\n\t\t     [1]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of\n\t\t\t    [list / e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as\n\t\t\t    well.  This is the ordered choice, aka prioritized\n\t\t\t    choice.\n\n\t\t     [2]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of\n\t\t\t    [list x e1 e2 ... ] is a parsing expression as\n\t\t\t    well.  This is the sequence.\n\n\t\t     [3]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list *\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    kleene closure, describing zero or more\n\t\t\t    repetitions.\n\n\t\t     [4]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list +\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    positive kleene closure, describing one or more\n\t\t\t    repetitions.\n\n\t\t     [5]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list &\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    and lookahead predicate.\n\n\t\t     [6]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list !\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    not lookahead predicate.\n\n\t\t     [7]    For a parsing expression e the result of [list ?\n\t\t\t    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This is the\n\t\t\t    optional input.\n\n       Canonical serialization\n\t      The canonical serialization of a parsing expression has the\n\t      format as specified in the previous item, and then additionally\n\t      satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique among all\n\t      the possible serializations of this parsing expression.\n\n\t      [1]    The string representation of the value is the canonical\n\t\t     representation of a pure Tcl list. I.e. it does not\n\t\t     contain superfluous whitespace.\n\n\t      [2]    Terminals are not encoded as ranges (where start and end\n\t\t     of the range are identical).\n\n   EXAMPLE\n       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the\n       rule"
