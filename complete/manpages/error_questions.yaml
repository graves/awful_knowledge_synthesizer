Each request specifies a queue file, a sender\n       address, the reason for non-delivery (specified as the next-hop\n       destination), and recipient information.  The reason may be prefixed\n       with an RFC 3463-compatible detail code; if none is specified a default\n       4.0.0 or 5.0.0 code is used instead.  This program expects to be run\n       from the master(8) process manager.\n\n       Depending on the service name in master.cf, error or retry, the server\n       bounces or defers all recipients in the delivery request using the\n       \"next-hop\" information as the reason for non-delivery. The retry\n       service name is supported as of Postfix 2.4.\n\n       Delivery status reports are sent to the bounce(8), defer(8) or trace(8)\n       daemon as appropriate.\n\nSECURITY\n       The error(8) mailer is not security-sensitive. It does not talk to the\n       network, and can be run chrooted at fixed low privilege.\n\nSTANDARDS\n       RFC 3463 (Enhanced Status Codes)\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).\n\n       Depending on the setting of the notify_classes parameter, the\n       postmaster is notified of bounces and of other trouble.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically as error(8) processes\n       run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command \"postfix reload\"\n       to speed up a change.\n\n       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for\n       more details including examples.\n\n       2bounce_notice_recipient (postmaster)\n\t      The recipient of undeliverable mail that cannot be returned to\n\t      the sender.\n\n       bounce_notice_recipient (postmaster)\n\t      The recipient of postmaster notifications with the message\n\t      headers of mail that Postfix did not deliver and of SMTP\n\t      conversation transcripts of mail that Postfix did not receive.\n\n       config_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf\n\t      configuration files.\n\n       daemon_timeout (18000s)\n\t      How much time a Postfix daemon process may take to handle a\n\t      request before it is terminated by a built-in watchdog timer.\n\n       delay_logging_resolution_limit (2)\n\t      The maximal number of digits after the decimal point when\n\t      logging sub-second delay values.\n\n       double_bounce_sender (double-bounce)\n\t      The sender address of postmaster notifications that are\n\t      generated by the mail system.\n\n       ipc_timeout (3600s)\n\t      The time limit for sending or receiving information over an\n\t      internal communication channel.\n\n       max_idle (100s)\n\t      The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix daemon process\n\t      waits for an incoming connection before terminating voluntarily.\n\n       max_use (100)\n\t      The maximal number of incoming connections that a Postfix daemon\n\t      process will service before terminating voluntarily.\n\n       notify_classes (resource, software)\n\t      The list of error classes that are reported to the postmaster.\n\n       process_id (read-only)\n\t      The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.\n\n       process_name (read-only)\n\t      The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.\n\n       queue_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      The location of the Postfix top-level queue directory.\n\n       syslog_facility (mail)\n\t      The syslog facility of Postfix logging.\n\n       syslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      A prefix that is prepended to the process name in syslog\n\t      records, so that, for example, \"smtpd\" becomes \"prefix/smtpd\".\n\nSEE ALSO\n       qmgr(8), queue manager\n       bounce(8), delivery status reports\n       discard(8), Postfix discard delivery agent\n       postconf(5), configuration parameters\n       master(5), generic daemon options\n       master(8), process manager\n       syslogd(8), system logging\n\nLICENSE\n       The Secure Mailer license must be distributed with this software.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n       Wietse Venema\n       IBM T.J.
