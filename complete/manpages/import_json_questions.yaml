The proper way to use this\n       functionality is through the package doctools::toc::import and the\n       import manager objects it provides.\n\nAPI\n       The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the\n       doctoc import plugin API version 2.\n\n       import string configuration\n\t      This command takes the string and parses it as JSON markup\n\t      encoding a table of contents, in the context of the specified\n\t      configuration (a dictionary). The result of the command is the\n\t      canonical serialization of that table of contents, in the form\n\t      specified in section ToC serialization format.\n\nJSON NOTATION OF TABLES OF CONTENTS\n       The JSON format used for tables of contents is a direct translation of\n       the ToC serialization format, mapping Tcl dictionaries as JSON objects\n       and Tcl lists as JSON arrays.  For example, the Tcl serialization\n\n       doctools::toc {\n\t   items {\n\t       {reference {\n\t\tdesc {DocTools - Tables of Contents}\n\t\t id introduction.man\n\t\t label doctools::toc::introduction\n\t    }}\n\t    {division {\n\t\t id processing.man\n\t\t items {\n\t\t     {reference {\n\t\t      desc {doctoc serialization utilities}\n\t\t      id structure.man\n\t\t      label doctools::toc::structure\n\t\t  }}\n\t\t  {reference {\n\t\t      desc {Parsing text in doctoc format}\n\t\t      id parse.man\n\t\t      label doctools::toc::parse\n\t\t  }}\n\t\t }\n\t\t    label Processing\n\t       }}\n\t   }\n\t   label {Table of Contents}\n\t   title TOC\n       }\n\n       is equivalent to the JSON string\n\n       {\n\t   \"doctools::toc\" : {\n\t       \"items\" : [{\n\t\t   \"reference\" : {\n\t\t       \"desc\"  : \"DocTools - Tables of Contents\",\n\t\t       \"id\"    : \"introduction.man\",\n\t\t       \"label\" : \"doctools::toc::introduction\"\n\t\t   }\n\t       },{\n\t\t   \"division\" : {\n\t\t       \"id\"    : \"processing.man\",\n\t\t       \"items\" : [{\n\t\t\t   \"reference\" : {\n\t\t\t       \"desc\"  : \"doctoc serialization utilities\",\n\t\t\t       \"id\"    : \"structure.man\",\n\t\t\t       \"label\" : \"doctools::toc::structure\"\n\t\t\t   }\n\t\t       },{\n\t\t\t   \"reference\" : {\n\t\t\t       \"desc\"  : \"Parsing text in doctoc format\",\n\t\t\t       \"id\"    : \"parse.man\",\n\t\t\t       \"label\" : \"doctools::toc::parse\"\n\t\t\t   }\n\t\t       }],\n\t\t       \"label\" : \"Processing\"\n\t\t   }\n\t       }],\n\t       \"label\" : \"Table of Contents\",\n\t       \"title\" : \"TOC\"\n\t   }\n       }"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `import_json`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nTOC SERIALIZATION FORMAT\n       Here we specify the format used by the doctools v2 packages to\n       serialize tables of contents as immutable values for transport,\n       comparison, etc.\n\n       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a\n       table of contents may have more than one regular serialization only\n       exactly one of them will be canonical.\n\n       regular serialization\n\n\t      [1]    The serialization of any table of contents is a nested\n\t\t     Tcl dictionary.\n\n\t      [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, doctools::toc, and\n\t\t     its value. This value holds the contents of the table of\n\t\t     contents.\n\n\t      [3]    The contents of the table of contents are a Tcl\n\t\t     dictionary holding the title of the table of contents, a\n\t\t     label, and its elements. The relevant keys and their\n\t\t     values are\n\n\t\t     title  The value is a string containing the title of the\n\t\t\t    table of contents.\n\n\t\t     label  The value is a string containing a label for the\n\t\t\t    table of contents.\n\n\t\t     items  The value is a Tcl list holding the elements of\n\t\t\t    the table, in the order they are to be shown.\n\n\t\t\t    Each element is a Tcl list holding the type of the\n\t\t\t    item, and its description, in this order. An\n\t\t\t    alternative description would be that it is a Tcl\n\t\t\t    dictionary holding a single key, the item type,\n\t\t\t    mapped to the item description.\n\n\t\t\t    The two legal item types and their descriptions\n\t\t\t    are\n\n\t\t\t    reference\n\t\t\t\t   This item describes a single entry in the\n\t\t\t\t   table of contents, referencing a single\n\t\t\t\t   document.  To this end its value is a Tcl\n\t\t\t\t   dictionary containing an id for the\n\t\t\t\t   referenced document, a label, and a longer\n\t\t\t\t   textual description which can be associated\n\t\t\t\t   with the entry.  The relevant keys and\n\t\t\t\t   their values are\n\n\t\t\t\t   id\t  The value is a string containing the\n\t\t\t\t\t  id of the document associated with\n\t\t\t\t\t  the entry.\n\n\t\t\t\t   label  The value is a string containing a\n\t\t\t\t\t  label for this entry. This string\n\t\t\t\t\t  also identifies the entry, and no\n\t\t\t\t\t  two entries (references and\n\t\t\t\t\t  divisions) in the containing list\n\t\t\t\t\t  are allowed to have the same label.\n\n\t\t\t\t   desc   The value is a string containing a\n\t\t\t\t\t  longer description for this entry.\n\n\t\t\t    division\n\t\t\t\t   This item describes a group of entries in\n\t\t\t\t   the table of contents, inducing a hierarchy\n\t\t\t\t   of entries.\tTo this end its value is a Tcl\n\t\t\t\t   dictionary containing a label for the\n\t\t\t\t   group, an optional id to a document for the\n\t\t\t\t   whole group, and the list of entries in the\n\t\t\t\t   group.  The relevant keys and their values\n\t\t\t\t   are\n\n\t\t\t\t   id\t  The value is a string containing the\n\t\t\t\t\t  id of the document associated with\n\t\t\t\t\t  the whole group. This key is\n\t\t\t\t\t  optional.\n\n\t\t\t\t   label  The value is a string containing a\n\t\t\t\t\t  label for the group. This string\n\t\t\t\t\t  also identifies the entry, and no\n\t\t\t\t\t  two entries (references and\n\t\t\t\t\t  divisions) in the containing list\n\t\t\t\t\t  are allowed to have the same label.\n\n\t\t\t\t   items  The value is a Tcl list holding the\n\t\t\t\t\t  elements of the group, in the order\n\t\t\t\t\t  they are to be shown.  This list has\n\t\t\t\t\t  the same structure as the value for\n\t\t\t\t\t  the keyword items used to describe\n\t\t\t\t\t  the whole table of contents, see\n\t\t\t\t\t  above. This closes the recusrive\n\t\t\t\t\t  definition of the structure, with\n\t\t\t\t\t  divisions holding the same type of\n\t\t\t\t\t  elements as the whole table of\n\t\t\t\t\t  contents, including other divisions.\n\n       canonical serialization\n\t      The canonical serialization of a table of contents has the\n\t      format as specified in the previous item, and then additionally\n\t      satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique among all\n\t      the possible serializations of this table of contents.\n\n\t      [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are\n\t\t     sorted in ascending dictionary order, as generated by\n\t\t     Tcl's builtin command lsort -increasing -dict.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
