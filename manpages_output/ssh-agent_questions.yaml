Through use of environment variables the agent can be\n     located and automatically used for authentication when logging in to\n     other machines using ssh(1).\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -a bind_address\n\t     Bind the agent to the UNIX-domain socket bind_address.  The\n\t     default is $TMPDIR/ssh-XXXXXXXXXX/agent.<ppid>.\n\n     -c      Generate C-shell commands on stdout.

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `ssh-agent`.



    Manpage text:

    There are two main ways to get an agent set up.  The first is at the
         start of an X session, where all other windows or programs are started as
         children of the ssh-agent program.  The agent starts a command under
         which its environment variables are exported, for example ssh-agent xterm
         &.  When the command terminates, so does the agent.

         The second method is used for a login session.  When ssh-agent is
         started, it prints the shell commands required to set its environment
         variables, which in turn can be evaluated in the calling shell, for
         example eval `ssh-agent -s`.

         In both cases, ssh(1) looks at these environment variables and uses them
         to establish a connection to the agent.

         The agent initially does not have any private keys.  Keys are added using
         ssh-add(1) or by ssh(1) when AddKeysToAgent is set in ssh_config(5).
         Multiple identities may be stored in ssh-agent concurrently and ssh(1)
         will automatically use them if present.  ssh-add(1) is also used to
         remove keys from ssh-agent and to query the keys that are held in one.
