Attempting to apply a patch to the wrong file will\n     usually produce garbage; consequently it is strongly recommended that\n     users of bspatch verify that oldfile matches the source file from which\n     patchfile was built, by comparing cryptographic hashes, for example.\n     Users may also wish to verify after running bspatch that newfile matches\n     the target file from which was built."
