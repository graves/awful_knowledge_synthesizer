This causes operations that are normally deferred, such as\n       display updates and window layout calculations, to be performed\n       immediately.\n\n       The update idletasks command is useful in scripts where changes have\n       been made to the application's state and you want those changes to\n       appear on the display immediately, rather than waiting for the script\n       to complete.  Most display updates are performed as idle callbacks, so\n       update idletasks will cause them to run.  However, there are some kinds\n       of updates that only happen in response to events, such as those\n       triggered by window size changes; these updates will not occur in\n       update idletasks.\n\n       The update command with no options is useful in scripts where you are\n       performing a long-running computation but you still want the\n       application to respond to events such as user interactions;  if you\n       occasionally call update then user input will be processed during the\n       next call to update.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       Run computations for about a second and then finish:\n\t      set x 1000\n\t      set done 0\n\t      after 1000 set done 1\n\t      while {!$done} {\n\t\t  # A very silly example!\n\t\t  set x [expr {log($x) ** 2.8}]\n\n\t\t  # Test to see if our time-limit has been hit.  This would\n\t\t  # also give a chance for serving network sockets and, if\n\t\t  # the Tk package is loaded, updating a user interface.\n\t\t  update\n\t      }"

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the update command to ensure that idle callbacks are executed immediately after a script modifies the application's state?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the update command in a Tcl script to process user interactions during a long-running computation?
