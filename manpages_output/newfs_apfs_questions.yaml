The second form creates a\n     container only, with no volumes.  The third form is used to non-\n     destructively add additional volumes inside an existing container.  The\n     fourth form reformats an existing volume by effectively deleting and re-\n     creating it; in this usage (only) special indicates a volume inside the\n     container."
