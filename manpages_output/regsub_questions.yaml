(Regular expression matching\n       is described in the re_syntax reference page.)  If there is a match,\n       then while copying string to varName (or to the result of this command\n       if varName is not present) the portion of string that matched exp is\n       replaced with subSpec.  If subSpec contains a “&” or “\\0”, then it is\n       replaced in the substitution with the portion of string that matched\n       exp.  If subSpec contains a “\\n”, where n is a digit between 1 and 9,\n       then it is replaced in the substitution with the portion of string that\n       matched the n'th parenthesized subexpression of exp.  Additional\n       backslashes may be used in subSpec to prevent special interpretation of\n       “&”, “\\0”, “\\n” and backslashes.  The use of backslashes in subSpec\n       tends to interact badly with the Tcl parser's use of backslashes, so it\n       is generally safest to enclose subSpec in braces if it includes\n       backslashes."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `regsub`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIf the initial arguments to regsub start with - then they are treated\n       as switches.  The following switches are currently supported:\n\n       -all\t All ranges in string that match exp are found and\n\t\t substitution is performed for each of these ranges.  Without\n\t\t this switch only the first matching range is found and\n\t\t substituted.  If -all is specified, then “&” and “\\n”\n\t\t sequences are handled for each substitution using the\n\t\t information from the corresponding match.\n\n       -expanded      Enables use of the expanded regular expression syntax\n\t\t      where whitespace and comments are ignored.  This is the\n\t\t      same as specifying the (?x) embedded option (see the\n\t\t      re_syntax manual page).\n\n       -line\t      Enables newline-sensitive matching.  By default, newline\n\t\t      is a completely ordinary character with no special\n\t\t      meaning.\tWith this flag, “[^” bracket expressions and\n\t\t      “.” never match newline, “^” matches an empty string\n\t\t      after any newline in addition to its normal function,\n\t\t      and “$” matches an empty string before any newline in\n\t\t      addition to its normal function.\tThis flag is\n\t\t      equivalent to specifying both -linestop and -lineanchor,\n\t\t      or the (?n) embedded option (see the re_syntax manual\n\t\t      page)."

This is the same as\n\t\t      specifying the (?p) embedded option (see the re_syntax\n\t\t      manual page).\n\n       -lineanchor    Changes the behavior of “^” and “$” (the “anchors”) so\n\t\t      they match the beginning and end of a line respectively.\n\t\t      This is the same as specifying the (?w) embedded option\n\t\t      (see the re_syntax manual page).\n\n       -nocase\t Upper-case characters in string will be converted to lower-\n\t\t case before matching against exp;  however, substitutions\n\t\t specified by subSpec use the original unconverted form of\n\t\t string.\n\n       -start index\n\t\t Specifies a character index offset into the string to start\n\t\t matching the regular expression at.  The index value is       │\n\t\t interpreted in the same manner as the index argument to       │\n\t\t string index.\tWhen using this switch, “^” will not match the\n\t\t beginning of the line, and \\A will still match the start of\n\t\t the string at index.  index will be constrained to the bounds\n\t\t of the input string."
