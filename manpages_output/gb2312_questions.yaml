GB 11383-1981 (ASCII) characters are represented by single bytes\n     in the range 0x00 to 0x7F.  Simplified Chinese characters are represented\n     by two bytes, both in the range 0xA1-0xFE.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     euc(5), gb18030(5), gbk(5)\n\nSTANDARDS\n     The GB2312 encoding is believed to be compatible with GB 2312-1980.  This\n     standard has been superseded by GB 18030-2000, but is still in wide use.\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t       November 7, 2003 \t\t    macOS 15.3"
