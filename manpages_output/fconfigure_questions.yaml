If one or more pairs of name and value are\n       supplied, the command sets each of the named options to the\n       corresponding value; in this case the return value is an empty string.\n\n       The options described below are supported for all channels. In\n       addition, each channel type may add options that only it supports. See\n       the manual entry for the command that creates each type of channels for\n       the options that that specific type of channel supports. For example,\n       see the manual entry for the socket command for its additional options.\n\n       -blocking boolean\n\t      The -blocking option determines whether I/O operations on the\n\t      channel can cause the process to block indefinitely.  The value\n\t      of the option must be a proper boolean value.  Channels are\n\t      normally in blocking mode;  if a channel is placed into\n\t      nonblocking mode it will affect the operation of the gets, read,\n\t      puts, flush, and close commands by allowing them to operate\n\t      asynchronously; see the documentation for those commands for\n\t      details.\tFor nonblocking mode to work correctly, the\n\t      application must be using the Tcl event loop (e.g. by calling\n\t      Tcl_DoOneEvent or invoking the vwait command).\n\n       -buffering newValue\n\t      If newValue is full then the I/O system will buffer output until\n\t      its internal buffer is full or until the flush command is\n\t      invoked. If newValue is line, then the I/O system will\n\t      automatically flush output for the channel whenever a newline\n\t      character is output. If newValue is none, the I/O system will\n\t      flush automatically after every output operation.  The default\n\t      is for -buffering to be set to full except for channels that\n\t      connect to terminal-like devices; for these channels the initial\n\t      setting is line.\tAdditionally, stdin and stdout are initially\n\t      set to line, and stderr is set to none.\n\n       -buffersize newSize\n\t      Newvalue must be an integer; its value is used to set the size\n\t      of buffers, in bytes, subsequently allocated for this channel to\n\t      store input or output. Newvalue must be between ten and one\n\t      million, allowing buffers of ten to one million bytes in size.\n\n       -encoding name\n\t      This option is used to specify the encoding of the channel, so\n\t      that the data can be converted to and from Unicode for use in\n\t      Tcl.  For instance, in order for Tcl to read characters from a\n\t      Japanese file in shiftjis and properly process and display the\n\t      contents, the encoding would be set to shiftjis.\tThereafter,\n\t      when reading from the channel, the bytes in the Japanese file\n\t      would be converted to Unicode as they are read.  Writing is also\n\t      supported - as Tcl strings are written to the channel they will\n\t      automatically be converted to the specified encoding on output.\n\n\t      If a file contains pure binary data (for instance, a JPEG\n\t      image), the encoding for the channel should be configured to be\n\t      binary.  Tcl will then assign no interpretation to the data in\n\t      the file and simply read or write raw bytes.  The Tcl binary\n\t      command can be used to manipulate this byte-oriented data.  It\n\t      is usually better to set the -translation option to binary when\n\t      you want to transfer binary data, as this turns off the other\n\t      automatic interpretations of the bytes in the stream as well.\n\n\t      The default encoding for newly opened channels is the same\n\t      platform- and locale-dependent system encoding used for\n\t      interfacing with the operating system, as returned by encoding\n\t      system.\n\n       -eofchar char\n\n       -eofchar {inChar outChar}\n\t      This option supports DOS file systems that use Control-z (\\x1a)\n\t      as an end of file marker.  If char is not an empty string, then\n\t      this character signals end-of-file when it is encountered during\n\t      input.  For output, the end-of-file character is output when the\n\t      channel is closed.  If char is the empty string, then there is\n\t      no special end of file character marker.\tFor read-write\n\t      channels, a two-element list specifies the end of file marker\n\t      for input and output, respectively.  As a convenience, when\n\t      setting the end-of-file character for a read-write channel you\n\t      can specify a single value that will apply to both reading and\n\t      writing.\tWhen querying the end-of-file character of a read-\n\t      write channel, a two-element list will always be returned.  The\n\t      default value for -eofchar is the empty string in all cases\n\t      except for files under Windows.  In that case the -eofchar is\n\t      Control-z (\\x1a) for reading and the empty string for writing.\n\t      The acceptable range for -eofchar values is \\x01 - \\x7f;\n\t      attempting to set -eofchar to a value outside of this range will\n\t      generate an error.\n\n       -translation mode\n\n       -translation {inMode outMode}\n\t      In Tcl scripts the end of a line is always represented using a\n\t      single newline character (\\n).  However, in actual files and\n\t      devices the end of a line may be represented differently on\n\t      different platforms, or even for different devices on the same\n\t      platform.  For example, under UNIX newlines are used in files,\n\t      whereas carriage-return-linefeed sequences are normally used in\n\t      network connections.  On input (i.e., with gets and read) the\n\t      Tcl I/O system automatically translates the external end-of-line\n\t      representation into newline characters.  Upon output (i.e., with\n\t      puts), the I/O system translates newlines to the external end-\n\t      of-line representation.  The default translation mode, auto,\n\t      handles all the common cases automatically, but the -translation\n\t      option provides explicit control over the end of line\n\t      translations.\n\n\t      The value associated with -translation is a single item for\n\t      read-only and write-only channels.  The value is a two-element\n\t      list for read-write channels; the read translation mode is the\n\t      first element of the list, and the write translation mode is the\n\t      second element.  As a convenience, when setting the translation\n\t      mode for a read-write channel you can specify a single value\n\t      that will apply to both reading and writing.  When querying the\n\t      translation mode of a read-write channel, a two-element list\n\t      will always be returned.\tThe following values are currently\n\t      supported:\n\n\t      auto   As the input translation mode, auto treats any of newline\n\t\t     (lf), carriage return (cr), or carriage return followed\n\t\t     by a newline (crlf) as the end of line representation.\n\t\t     The end of line representation can even change from line-\n\t\t     to-line, and all cases are translated to a newline.  As\n\t\t     the output translation mode, auto chooses a platform\n\t\t     specific representation; for sockets on all platforms Tcl\n\t\t     chooses crlf, for all Unix flavors, it chooses lf, and\n\t\t     for the various flavors of Windows it chooses crlf.  The\n\t\t     default setting for -translation is auto for both input\n\t\t     and output.\n\n\t      binary No end-of-line translations are performed.  This is\n\t\t     nearly identical to lf mode, except that in addition\n\t\t     binary mode also sets the end-of-file character to the\n\t\t     empty string (which disables it) and sets the encoding to\n\t\t     binary (which disables encoding filtering).  See the\n\t\t     description of -eofchar and -encoding for more\n\t\t     information.\n\n\t\t     Internally, i.e. when it comes to the actual behaviour of\n\t\t     the translator this value is identical to lf and is\n\t\t     therefore reported as such when queried. Even if binary\n\t\t     was used to set the translation.\n\n\t      cr     The end of a line in the underlying file or device is\n\t\t     represented by a single carriage return character.  As\n\t\t     the input translation mode, cr mode converts carriage\n\t\t     returns to newline characters.  As the output translation\n\t\t     mode, cr mode translates newline characters to carriage\n\t\t     returns.\n\n\t      crlf   The end of a line in the underlying file or device is\n\t\t     represented by a carriage return character followed by a\n\t\t     linefeed character.  As the input translation mode, crlf\n\t\t     mode converts carriage-return-linefeed sequences to\n\t\t     newline characters.  As the output translation mode, crlf\n\t\t     mode translates newline characters to carriage-return-\n\t\t     linefeed sequences.  This mode is typically used on\n\t\t     Windows platforms and for network connections.\n\n\t      lf     The end of a line in the underlying file or device is\n\t\t     represented by a single newline (linefeed) character.  In\n\t\t     this mode no translations occur during either input or\n\t\t     output.  This mode is typically used on UNIX platforms.\n\nSTANDARD CHANNELS\n       The Tcl standard channels (stdin, stdout, and stderr) can be configured\n       through this command like every other channel opened by the Tcl\n       library. Beyond the standard options described above they will also\n       support any special option according to their current type.  If, for\n       example, a Tcl application is started by the inet super-server common\n       on Unix system its Tcl standard channels will be sockets and thus\n       support the socket options.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Instruct Tcl to always send output to stdout immediately, whether or\n       not it is to a terminal:\n\t      fconfigure stdout -buffering none\n\n       Open a socket and read lines from it without ever blocking the\n       processing of other events:\n\t      set s [socket some.where.com 12345]\n\t      fconfigure $s -blocking 0\n\t      fileevent $s readable \"readMe $s\"\n\t      proc readMe chan {\n\t\t if {[gets $chan line] < 0} {\n\t\t    if {[eof $chan]} {\n\t\t       close $chan\n\t\t       return\n\t\t    }\n\t\t    # Could not read a complete line this time; Tcl's\n\t\t    # internal buffering will hold the partial line for us\n\t\t    # until some more data is available over the socket.\n\t\t } else {\n\t\t    puts stdout $line\n\t\t }\n\t      }\n\n       Read a PPM-format image from a file:\n\t      # Open the file and put it into Unix ASCII mode\n\t      set f [open teapot.ppm]\n\t      fconfigure $f -encoding ascii -translation lf\n\n\t      # Get the header\n\t      if {[gets $f] ne \"P6\"} {\n\t\t error \"not a raw-bits PPM\"\n\t      }\n\n\t      # Read lines until we have got non-comment lines\n\t      # that supply us with three decimal values.\n\t      set words {}\n\t      while {[llength $words] < 3} {\n\t\t gets $f line\n\t\t if {[string match \"#*\" $line]} continue\n\t\t lappend words {*}[join [scan $line %d%d%d]]\n\t      }\n\n\t      # Those words supply the size of the image and its\n\t      # overall depth per channel.
