See nfs.conf(5) for NFS configuration info.\n\n     nfsiod controls the maximum number of asynchronous I/O threads used for\n     NFS mounts.  Historically, it has consisted of a daemon that never exits.\n     However, asynchronous I/O requests are now serviced by threads launched\n     on demand in the kernel and the nfsiod command simply sets the\n     configuration limit.\n\n     Having asynchronous I/O threads improves performance but is not required\n     for correct operation.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -n      Specify maximum number of asynchronous I/O threads to be used.\n\n     If no maximum is specified, nfsiod displays the current value.  The\n     default value is 16.  A client should allow enough threads to handle its\n     maximum level of concurrency.\n\n     The nfsiod utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the nfsiod tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use nfsiod to set the maximum number of asynchronous I/O threads to 32?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using nfsiod to display the current number of asynchronous I given that the default value is 16?
