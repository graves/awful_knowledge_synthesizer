Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `afscexpand`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nafscexpand(1)\t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t afscexpand(1)\n\nNAME\n     afscexpand â€“ decompress files compressed with HFS+ compression\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     afscexpand [-c] path [...]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The afscexpand command is used to decompress files compressed with HFS+\n     compression.\n\n     Paths specified are recursively traversed (while remaining on the\n     starting filesystem) and all encountered files are decompressed. If the\n     -c option is specified, the encountered files will not be decompressed,\n     but their contents will be printed to standard output.\n\nHISTORY\n     afscexpand first appeared in Mac OS X 10.6.\n\nMac OS X\t\t       February 7, 2009 \t\t      Mac OS X"
