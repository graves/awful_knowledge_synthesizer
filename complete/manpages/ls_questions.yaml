    LEGACY DESCRIPTION
         In legacy mode, the -f option does not turn on the -a option and the -g,
         -n, and -o options do not turn on the -l option.

         Also, the -o option causes the file flags to be included in a long (-l)
         output; there is no -O option.

         When -H is specified (and not overridden by -L or -P) and a file argument
         is a symlink that resolves to a non-directory file, the output will
         reflect the nature of the link, rather than that of the file.  In legacy
         operation, the output will describe the file.

         For more information about legacy mode, see compat(5).

    STANDARDS
         With the exception of options -g, -n and -o, the ls utility conforms to
         IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”) and IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”).
         The options -B, -D, -G, -I, -T, -U, -W, -Z, -b, -h, -w, -y and -, are
         non-standard extensions.
