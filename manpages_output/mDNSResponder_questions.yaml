On Mac\n     OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), mDNSResponder is also the system-wide Unicast\n     DNS Resolver.\n\n     mDNSResponder listens on UDP port 5353 for Multicast DNS Query packets.\n     When it receives a query for which it knows an answer, mDNSResponder\n     issues the appropriate Multicast DNS Reply packet.\n\n     mDNSResponder also performs Unicast and Multicast DNS Queries on behalf\n     of client processes, and maintains a cache of the replies.\n\n     mDNSResponder has no user-specifiable command-line argument, and users\n     should not run mDNSResponder manually.\n\nLOGGING\n     There are several methods with which to examine mDNSResponder's internal\n     state for debugging and diagnostic purposes. The syslog(1) logging levels\n     map as follows:"

For example, to enable log levels\n     Emergency - Debug:\n\n\t   % sudo syslog -c mDNSResponder -d\n\n     A SIGUSR2 signal toggles packet logging:\n\n\t   % sudo killall -USR2 mDNSResponder\n\n     A SIGINFO signal will dump a snapshot summary of the internal state to\n     /var/log/system.log:\n\n\t   % sudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder\n\nOPTIONAL ARGUMENTS\n     mDNSResponder accepts the following optional arguments:\n\n     -AlwaysAppendSearchDomains\n\t\t\t\tAppend search domains for multi-labeled\n\t\t\t\tPartially Qualified Domain Name as well as\n\t\t\t\tsingle-labeled Partially Qualified Domain\n\t\t\t\tName.  This argument is not recommended\n\t\t\t\tbecause of the extra DNS traffic it generates\n\t\t\t\tand its adverse effect on battery life."
