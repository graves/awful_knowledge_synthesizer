The format of IP options to be sent is that specified\n     by the IP protocol specification (RFC-791), with one exception: the list\n     of addresses for Source Route options must include the first-hop gateway\n     at the beginning of the list of gateways.\tThe first-hop gateway address\n     will be extracted from the option list and the size adjusted accordingly\n     before use.

       Multicast Options
         IP multicasting is supported only on AF_INET sockets of type SOCK_DGRAM
         and SOCK_RAW, and only on networks where the interface driver supports
         multicasting.

         The IP_MULTICAST_TTL option changes the time-to-live (TTL) for outgoing
         multicast datagrams in order to control the scope of the multicasts:

         u_char ttl;     /* range: 0 to 255, default = 1 */
         setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_MULTICAST_TTL, &ttl, sizeof(ttl));

         Datagrams with a TTL of 1 are not forwarded beyond the local network.
         Multicast datagrams with a TTL of 0 will not be transmitted on any
         network, but may be delivered locally if the sending host belongs to the
         destination group and if multicast loopback has not been disabled on the
         sending socket (see below).  Multicast datagrams with TTL greater than 1
         may be forwarded to other networks if a multicast router is attached to
         the local network.

    Manpage text:

    For hosts with multiple interfaces, each multicast transmission is sent
         from the primary network interface.  The IP_MULTICAST_IF option overrides
         the default for subsequent transmissions from a given socket:

         struct in_addr addr;
         setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_MULTICAST_IF, &addr, sizeof(addr));

         where "addr" is the local IP address of the desired interface or
         INADDR_ANY to specify the default interface.  An interface's local IP
         address and multicast capability can be obtained via the SIOCGIFCONF and
         SIOCGIFFLAGS ioctls.  Normal applications should not need to use this
         option.

         If a multicast datagram is sent to a group to which the sending host
         itself belongs (on the outgoing interface), a copy of the datagram is, by
         default, looped back by the IP layer for local delivery.  The
         IP_MULTICAST_LOOP option gives the sender explicit control over whether
         or not subsequent datagrams are looped back:

         u_char loop;    /* 0 = disable, 1 = enable (default) */
         setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_MULTICAST_LOOP, &loop, sizeof(loop));

    This option improves performance for applications that may have no more
         than one instance on a single host (such as a router demon), by
         eliminating the overhead of receiving their own transmissions.  It should
         generally not be used by applications for which there may be more than
         one instance on a single host (such as a conferencing program) or for
         which the sender does not belong to the destination group (such as a time
         querying program).

         A multicast datagram sent with an initial TTL greater than 1 may be
         delivered to the sending host on a different interface from that on which
         it was sent, if the host belongs to the destination group on that other
         interface.  The loopback control option has no effect on such delivery.

         A host must become a member of a multicast group before it can receive
         datagrams sent to the group.  To join a multicast group, use the
         IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP option:

         struct ip_mreq mreq;
         setsockopt(s, IPPROTO_IP, IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, &mreq, sizeof(mreq));
