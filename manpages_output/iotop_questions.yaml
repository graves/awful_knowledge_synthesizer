Uses DTrace.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       iotop [-C] [-D|-o|-P] [-j|-Z] [-d device] [-f filename] [-m\n       mount_point] [-t top] [interval [count]]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       iotop tracks disk I/O by process, and prints a summary report that is\n       refreshed every interval.\n\n       This is measuring disk events that have made it past system caches.\n\n       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this\n       command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -C     don't clear the screen\n\n       -D     print delta times - elapsed, us\n\n       -j     print project ID\n\n       -o     print disk delta times, us\n\n       -P     print %I/O (disk delta times)\n\n       -Z     print zone ID\n\n       -d device\n\t      instance name to snoop (eg, dad0)\n\n       -f filename\n\t      full pathname of file to snoop\n\n       -m mount_point\n\t      mountpoint for filesystem to snoop\n\n       -t top print top number only\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Default output, print summary every 5 seconds\n\t      # iotop\n\n       One second samples,\n\t      # iotop 1\n\n       print %I/O (time based),\n\t      # iotop -P\n\n       Snoop events on the root filesystem only,\n\t      # iotop -m /\n\n       Print top 20 lines only,\n\t      # iotop -t 20\n\n       Print 12 x 5 second samples, scrolling,\n\t      # iotop -C 5 12\n\nFIELDS\n       UID    user ID\n\n       PID    process ID\n\n       PPID   parent process ID\n\n       PROJ   project ID\n\n       ZONE   zone ID\n\n       CMD    command name for the process\n\n       DEVICE device name\n\n       MAJ    device major number\n\n       MIN    device minor number\n\n       D      direction, Read or Write\n\n       BYTES  total size of operations, bytes\n\n       ELAPSED\n\t      total elapsed times from request to completion, us (this is the\n\t      elapsed time from the disk request (strategy) to the disk\n\t      completion (iodone))\n\n       DISKTIME\n\t      total times for disk to complete request, us (this is the time\n\t      for the disk to complete that event since it's last event (time\n\t      between iodones), or, the time to the strategy if the disk had\n\t      been idle)\n\n       %I/O   percent disk I/O, based on time (DISKTIME)\n\n       load   1 minute load average\n\n       disk_r total disk read Kb for sample\n\n       disk_w total disk write Kb for sample\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs\n       directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with\n       verbose descriptions explaining the output.\n\nEXIT\n       iotop will run forever until Ctrl-C is hit, or the specified interval\n       is reached.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Brendan Gregg [Sydney, Australia]\n\nSEE ALSO\n       iosnoop(1M), dtrace(1M)"
