The user must fill in the appropriate fields\n       and exit the editor.  bashbug then mails the completed report to bug-\n       bash@gnu.org, or address.  If the report cannot be mailed, it is saved\n       in the file dead.bashbug in the invoking user's home directory.\n\n       The bug report format outline consists of several sections.  The first\n       section provides information about the machine, operating system, the\n       bash version, and the compilation environment.  The second section\n       should be filled in with a description of the bug.  The third section\n       should be a description of how to reproduce the bug.  The optional\n       fourth section is for a proposed fix.  Fixes are encouraged."
