An\n\t      optional length determines the number of history entries to\n\t      keep. This may be changed later with ::history::configure.\n\t      History entries must be added with the ::history::add command\n\t      before they can be seen.\n\n       ::history::remove pathName\n\t      Forgets all history entries for the Entry pathName and removes\n\t      the history bindings.\n\n       ::history::add pathName text\n\t      This command is used to add history entries to an Entry that has\n\t      previously had ::history::init called on it. This command should\n\t      be called from your Entry handler with the contents of the entry\n\t      (or whatever you wish to add to the history).\n\n       ::history::get pathName\n\t      This command returns a list containing the history entries for\n\t      the Entry pathName\n\n       ::history::clear pathName\n\t      This command clears the history list for the named Entry.\n\n       ::history::configure pathName option ?value?\n\t      This command queries or sets configuration options. Currently\n\t      the options recognized are length and alert. Setting the length\n\t      determines the number of history entries to keep for the named\n\t      Entry. Alert specifies the command to run when the user reaches\n\t      the end of the history, it defaults to\n\n       bell\n\n\n       entry .e\n       bind .e <Return> [list ProcessEntry %W]\n       ::history::init .e\n       pack .e\n\n       proc ProcessEntry {w} {\n\t   set text [$w get]\n\t   if {$text == \"\"} { return }\n\t   ::history::add $w $text\n\t   puts $text\n\t   $w delete 0 end\n       }"
