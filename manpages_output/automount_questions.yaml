If the auto_master file does not exist or is\n     empty and a Directory Service is configured, the service will be queried\n     for an auto_master map.  It will also attempt to unmount any top-level\n     autofs mounts that correspond to maps no longer found.\n\nOPTIONS\n     -v      Print more detailed information about actions taken by automount.\n\n     -c      Tell automountd(8) to flush any cached information it has.\n\n     -u      Unmount all non-busy automounted mounts.  Top-level triggers are\n\t     preserved.\n\n     -t timeout\n\t     Set to timeout seconds the time after which an automounted file\n\t     system will be unmounted if it hasn't been referred to within\n\t     that period of time.  The default is 1 hour (3600 seconds)."
