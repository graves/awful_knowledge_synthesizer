This time is an\n       approximation of the arrival or transmission time.  If it is supplied\n       by the operating system running on the host on which the capture is\n       being done, there are several reasons why it might not precisely\n       represent the arrival or transmission time:\n\n\t      if the time stamp is applied to the packet when the networking\n\t      stack receives the packet, the networking stack might not see\n\t      the packet until an interrupt is delivered for the packet or a\n\t      timer event causes the networking device driver to poll for\n\t      packets, and the time stamp might not be applied until the\n\t      packet has had some processing done by other code in the\n\t      networking stack, so there might be a significant delay between\n\t      the time when the last bit of the packet is received by the\n\t      capture device and when the networking stack time-stamps the\n\t      packet;"

    Manpage text:

    The pcap_set_tstamp_precision(3PCAP) routine can be used after a
           pcap_create() call and after a pcap_activate() call to specify the
           resolution of the time stamps to get for the device.  If the hardware
           or software cannot supply a higher-resolution time stamp, the
           pcap_set_tstamp_precision() call will fail, and the time stamps
           supplied after the pcap_activate() call will have microsecond
           resolution.

           When opening a savefile, the
           pcap_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision(3PCAP) and
           pcap_fopen_offline_with_tstamp_precision(3PCAP) routines can be used to
           specify the resolution of time stamps to be read from the file; if the
           time stamps in the file have a lower resolution, the fraction-of-a-
           second portion of the time stamps will be scaled to the specified
           resolution.

           The pcap_get_tstamp_precision(3PCAP) routine returns the resolution of
           time stamps that will be supplied; when capturing packets, this does
           not reflect the actual precision of the time stamp supplied by the
           hardware or operating system and, when reading a savefile, this does
           not indicate the actual precision of time stamps in the file.
