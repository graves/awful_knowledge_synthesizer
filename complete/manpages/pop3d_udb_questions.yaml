The databases will use the names of users as keys and associates\n       passwords and storage references with them.\n\n       Objects created by this package can be directly used in the\n       authentication callback of pop3 servers following the same interface as\n       servers created by the package pop3d.\n\n       ::pop3d::udb::new ?dbName?\n\t      This command creates a new database object with an associated\n\t      global Tcl command whose name is dbName.\n\n       The command dbName may be used to invoke various operations on the\n       database.  It has the following general form:\n\n       dbName option ?arg arg ...?\n\t      Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.\n\n       The following commands are possible for database objects:\n\n       dbName destroy\n\t      Destroys the database object.\n\n       dbName add user pwd storage\n\t      Add a new user or changes the data of an existing user. Stores\n\t      password and storage reference for the given user.\n\n       dbName remove user\n\t      Removes the specified user from the database.\n\n       dbName rename user newName\n\t      Changes the name of the specified user to newName.\n\n       dbName lookup user\n\t      Searches the database for the specified user and returns a two-\n\t      element list containing the associated password and storage\n\t      reference, in this order. Throws an error if the user could not\n\t      be found. This is the interface as expected by the\n\t      authentication callback of package pop3d.\n\n       dbName exists user\n\t      Returns true if the specified user is known to the database,\n\t      else false.\n\n       dbName who\n\t      Returns a list of users known to the database.\n\n       dbName save ?file?\n\t      Saves the contents of the database into the given file. If the\n\t      file is not specified the system will use the path last used in\n\t      a call to dbName read. The generated file can be read by the\n\t      read method.\n\n       dbName read file\n\t      Reads the specified file and adds the contained user definitions\n\t      to the database. As the file is actually source'd a safe\n\t      interpreter is employed to safeguard against malicious code.\n\t      This interpreter knows the add command for adding users and\n\t      their associated data to this database. This command has the\n\t      same argument signature as the method add. The path of the file\n\t      is remembered internally so that it can be used in the next call\n\t      of dbName save without an argument.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category pop3d of\n       the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       internet, network, pop3, protocol\n\nCATEGORY\n       Networking\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2002 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
