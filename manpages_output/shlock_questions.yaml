When it attempts to create a lock file, if one\n     already exists, shlock verifies that it is or is not valid.  If valid,\n     shlock will exit with a non-zero exit code.  If invalid, shlock will\n     remove the lock file, and create a new one.\n\n     shlock uses the link(2) system call to make the final target lock file,\n     which is an atomic operation (i.e. \"dot locking\", so named for this\n     mechanism's original use for locking system mailboxes).  It puts the\n     process ID (\"PID\") from the command line into the requested lock file.\n\n     shlock verifies that an extant lock file is still valid by using kill(2)\n     with a zero signal to check for the existence of the process that holds\n     the lock."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `shlock`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe examples assume that the file system where the lock file is to be\n     created is writable by the user, and has space available.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     lockf(1)\n\nHISTORY\n     shlock was written for the first Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)\n     software distribution, released in March 1986.  The algorithm was\n     suggested by Peter Honeyman, from work he did on HoneyDanBer UUCP.\n\nAUTHORS\n     Erik E. Fair <fair@clock.org>\n\nBUGS\n     Does not work on NFS or other network file system on different systems\n     because the disparate systems have disjoint PID spaces.\n\n     Cannot handle the case where a lock file was not deleted, the process\n     that created it has exited, and the system has created a new process with\n     the same PID as in the dead lock file.  The lock file will appear to be\n     valid even though the process is unrelated to the one that created the\n     lock in the first place.  Always remove your lock files after you're\n     done.\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t       November 2, 2012 \t\t    macOS 15.3"
