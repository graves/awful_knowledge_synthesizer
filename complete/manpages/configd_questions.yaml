The agents look to one or more input sources\n     (preferences, low-level kernel events, configd notifications, etc) and,\n     through a set of policy modules, interacts with the system to establish\n     the desired operational configuration.\n\n     Access to the data maintained by configd is via the\n     SystemConfiguration.framework SCDynamicStore APIs.\n\nOPTIONS\n     The command line options are as follows:"
