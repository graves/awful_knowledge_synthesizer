By default, a pattern matches an input line\n     if the regular expression (RE) in the pattern matches the input line\n     without its trailing newline.  An empty expression matches every line.\n     Each input line that matches at least one of the patterns is written to\n     the standard output.\n\n     grep is used for simple patterns and basic regular expressions (BREs);\n     egrep can handle extended regular expressions (EREs).  See re_format(7)\n     for more information on regular expressions.  fgrep is quicker than both\n     grep and egrep, but can only handle fixed patterns (i.e., it does not\n     interpret regular expressions).  Patterns may consist of one or more\n     lines, allowing any of the pattern lines to match a portion of the input."
