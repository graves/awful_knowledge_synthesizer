      You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text that has been scanned using Optical Character Recognition Technology. It is from "Algebra and Trigonometry" by Robert F. Blitzer. Please synthesize 3 questions that can be answered by integrating the following reading. The answers to these questions must require the use of logic, reasoning, and creative problem solving for a final exam test that can only be answered using the text provided. The test taker will not have the text during the test so the test questions must be comprehensive and not require reference material.

      Definitions, Rules, and Formulas

      THE REAL NUMBERS

      Natural Numbers: {1, 2,3,...}

      Whole Numbers: {0,1,2,3,...}

      Integers: {...,—3, —2, -1,0,1,2,3,...}

      Rational Numbers: {¢ |a and b are integers, b # o}

      Irrational Numbers: — {x|x is real and not rational}

      PROPERTIES OF ADDITION AND MULTIPLICATION
      Commutative: a+ b=b+ a,ab = ba
      (a + b) + c = a + (b + c);

      (ab)c = a(bc)

      Distributive: a(b + c) = ab + ac, a(b − c) = ab − ac

      Associative:

      Identity: a + 0 = a, a · 1 = a

      Inverse: a + (−a) = 0; a · (1/a) = 1 (a ≠ 0)

      Multiplication Properties: (−1)a = −a;

      (−1)(−a) = a; a + 0 = 0; (−a)(b) = (a)(−b) = −ab; (−a)(−b) = ab

      EXPONENTS
      Definitions of Rational Exponents

      1. a^(m/n) = (a^(1/n))^m or (a^m)^(1/n)
      2. a^(m/n) = (a^(1/n))^m or (a^m)^(1/n)
      3. a^(m/n) = (a^m)^(1/n)

        "finalExamQuestion1": "**Synthesis of Properties of Real Numbers**\\n\\nUsing the definitions of the properties of addition and multiplication provided in the text, simplify the expression $ 3x + 2(5 - x) $.\\n- **Step 1**: Apply the distributive property to expand the terms.\\n- **Step 2**: Use the associative and commutative properties to combine like terms.\\n- **Step 3**: Justify each step by referencing the specific property (e.g., \"The distributive property states that...\").\\n**Answer Requirement**: Your final simplified expression must be correct, and you must explicitly identify at least two distinct properties used in your reasoning.  ",
        "finalExamQuestion2": "**Application of Rational Exponent Definitions**\\n\\nEvaluate $ 16^{3/4} $ using the three definitions of rational exponents provided in the text:\\n- **Definition 1**: $ a^{m/n} = (a^{1/n})^m $\\n- **Definition 2**: $ a^{m/n} = (a^m)^{1/n} $ \\n- **Definition 3**: $ a^{m/n} = (a^m)^{1/n} $\\n\\n**Task**:\\n- **Part A**: Compute the value using Definition 1. Show all intermediate steps, including simplifying radicals and exponents.\\n- **Part B**: Verify that your result matches the value obtained using Definition 2. Explain why Definitions 1 and 2 yield the same outcome despite their different order of operations.\\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text's repeated emphasis on equivalent forms (e.g., $ a^{m/n} = (a^m)^{1/n} $) ensures consistency in simplifying expressions with rational exponents.\\n\\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate mastery of all three definitions and explicitly link their equivalence to the properties of exponents.",
        "finalExamQuestion3": "**Logical Reasoning with Number Classifications**\\n\\nThe text defines natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers. Consider the number $ \\sqrt{16} $.\\n- **Part A**: Determine which sets (natural, whole, integer, rational, or irrational) this number belongs to. Justify your answer using definitions from the text.\\n- **Part B**: Explain why $ \\sqrt{16} $ is not classified as an irrational number, despite involving a square root. Use logical reasoning based on the distinction between rational and irrational numbers provided in the text.\\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the claim: \"All numbers with exponents are irrational.\" Your example must reference at least two sets from the text (e.g., integers, rationals) and clarify how they relate to exponentiation.\\n\\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the hierarchy of real number classifications and demonstrate an understanding of why certain numbers fall into specific categories."
