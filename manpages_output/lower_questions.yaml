- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `lower`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nlower(n)\t\t     Tk Built-In Commands\t\t      lower(n)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nNAME\n       lower - Change a window's position in the stacking order\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       lower window ?belowThis?\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       If the belowThis argument is omitted then the command lowers window so\n       that it is below all of its siblings in the stacking order (it will be\n       obscured by any siblings that overlap it and will not obscure any\n       siblings).  If belowThis is specified then it must be the path name of\n       a window that is either a sibling of window or the descendant of a\n       sibling of window.  In this case the lower command will insert window\n       into the stacking order just below belowThis (or the ancestor of\n       belowThis that is a sibling of window); this could end up either\n       raising or lowering window.\n\n\nSEE ALSO\n       raise\n\n\nKEYWORDS\n       lower, obscure, stacking order\n\nTk\t\t\t\t      3.3\t\t\t      lower(n)"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the lower command in Tk?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the lower command to position a window below all of its siblings?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the lower command to place a window below a specific sibling window named 'belowThis'?
