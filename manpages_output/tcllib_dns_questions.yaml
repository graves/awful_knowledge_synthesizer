You\n       should refer to (1) and (2) for information about the DNS protocol or\n       read resolver(3) to find out how the C library resolves domain names.\n       The intention of this package is to insulate Tcl scripts from problems\n       with using the system library resolver for slow name servers.  It may\n       or may not be of practical use. Internet name resolution is a complex\n       business and DNS is only one part of the resolver. You may find you are\n       supposed to be using hosts files, NIS or WINS to name a few other\n       systems. This package is not a substitute for the C library resolver -\n       it does however implement name resolution over DNS.  The package also\n       extends the package uri to support DNS URIs (4) of the form\n       dns:what.host.com or dns://my.nameserver/what.host.com. The\n       dns::resolve command can handle DNS URIs or simple domain names as a\n       query.\n\n       Note: The package defaults to using DNS over TCP connections. If you\n       wish to use UDP you will need to have the tcludp package installed and\n       have a version that correctly handles binary data (> 1.0.4).  This is\n       available at http://tcludp.sourceforge.net/.  If the udp package is\n       present then UDP will be used by default.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::dns::resolve query ?options?\n\t      Resolve a domain name using the DNS protocol. query is the\n\t      domain name to be lookup up. This should be either a fully\n\t      qualified domain name or a DNS URI.\n\n\t      -nameserver hostname or -server hostname\n\t\t     Specify an alternative name server for this request.\n\n\t      -protocol tcp|udp\n\t\t     Specify the network protocol to use for this request. Can\n\t\t     be one of tcp or udp.\n\n\t      -port portnum\n\t\t     Specify an alternative port.\n\n\t      -search domainlist\n\n\t      -timeout milliseconds\n\t\t     Override the default timeout.\n\n\t      -type TYPE\n\t\t     Specify the type of DNS record you are interested in.\n\t\t     Valid values are A, NS, MD, MF, CNAME, SOA, MB, MG, MR,\n\t\t     NULL, WKS, PTR, HINFO, MINFO, MX, TXT, SPF, SRV, AAAA,\n\t\t     AXFR, MAILB, MAILA and *.\tSee RFC1035 for details about\n\t\t     the return values.  See http://spf.pobox.com/ about SPF.\n\t\t     See (3) about AAAA records and RFC2782 for details of SRV\n\t\t     records.\n\n\t      -class CLASS\n\t\t     Specify the class of domain name. This is usually IN but\n\t\t     may be one of IN for internet domain names, CS, CH, HS or\n\t\t     * for any class.\n\n\t      -recurse boolean\n\t\t     Set to false if you do not want the name server to\n\t\t     recursively act upon your request. Normally set to true.\n\n\t      -command procname\n\t\t     Set a procedure to be called upon request completion. The\n\t\t     procedure will be passed the token as its only argument."
