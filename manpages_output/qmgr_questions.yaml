The actual mail routing\n       strategy is delegated to the trivial-rewrite(8) daemon.\tThis program\n       expects to be run from the master(8) process manager.\n\n       Mail addressed to the local double-bounce address is logged and\n       discarded.  This stops potential loops caused by undeliverable bounce\n       notifications.\n\nMAIL QUEUES\n       The qmgr(8) daemon maintains the following queues:\n\n       incoming\n\t      Inbound mail from the network, or mail picked up by the local\n\t      pickup(8) daemon from the maildrop directory.\n\n       active Messages that the queue manager has opened for delivery. Only a\n\t      limited number of messages is allowed to enter the active queue\n\t      (leaky bucket strategy, for a fixed delivery rate).\n\n       deferred\n\t      Mail that could not be delivered upon the first attempt. The\n\t      queue manager implements exponential backoff by doubling the\n\t      time between delivery attempts.\n\n       corrupt\n\t      Unreadable or damaged queue files are moved here for inspection.\n\n       hold   Messages that are kept \"on hold\" are kept here until someone\n\t      sets them free.\n\nDELIVERY STATUS REPORTS\n       The qmgr(8) daemon keeps an eye on per-message delivery status reports\n       in the following directories. Each status report file has the same name\n       as the corresponding message file:\n\n       bounce Per-recipient status information about why mail is bounced.\n\t      These files are maintained by the bounce(8) daemon.\n\n       defer  Per-recipient status information about why mail is delayed.\n\t      These files are maintained by the defer(8) daemon.\n\n       trace  Per-recipient status information as requested with the Postfix\n\t      \"sendmail -v\" or \"sendmail -bv\" command.\tThese files are\n\t      maintained by the trace(8) daemon.\n\n       The qmgr(8) daemon is responsible for asking the bounce(8), defer(8) or\n       trace(8) daemons to send delivery reports.\n\nSTRATEGIES\n       The queue manager implements a variety of strategies for either opening\n       queue files (input) or for message delivery (output).\n\n       leaky bucket\n\t      This strategy limits the number of messages in the active queue\n\t      and prevents the queue manager from running out of memory under\n\t      heavy load.\n\n       fairness\n\t      When the active queue has room, the queue manager takes one\n\t      message from the incoming queue and one from the deferred queue.\n\t      This prevents a large mail backlog from blocking the delivery of\n\t      new mail.\n\n       slow start\n\t      This strategy eliminates \"thundering herd\" problems by slowly\n\t      adjusting the number of parallel deliveries to the same\n\t      destination.\n\n       round robin\n\t      The queue manager sorts delivery requests by destination.\n\t      Round-robin selection prevents one destination from dominating\n\t      deliveries to other destinations.\n\n       exponential backoff\n\t      Mail that cannot be delivered upon the first attempt is\n\t      deferred.  The time interval between delivery attempts is\n\t      doubled after each attempt.\n\n       destination status cache\n\t      The queue manager avoids unnecessary delivery attempts by\n\t      maintaining a short-term, in-memory list of unreachable\n\t      destinations.\n\n       preemptive message scheduling\n\t      The queue manager attempts to minimize the average per-recipient\n\t      delay while still preserving the correct per-message delays,\n\t      using a sophisticated preemptive message scheduling.\n\nTRIGGERS\n       On an idle system, the queue manager waits for the arrival of trigger\n       events, or it waits for a timer to go off. A trigger is a one-byte\n       message.  Depending on the message received, the queue manager performs\n       one of the following actions (the message is followed by the symbolic\n       constant used internally by the software):\n\n       D (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_DEFERRED)\n\t      Start a deferred queue scan.  If a deferred queue scan is\n\t      already in progress, that scan will be restarted as soon as it\n\t      finishes.\n\n       I (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_INCOMING)\n\t      Start an incoming queue scan. If an incoming queue scan is\n\t      already in progress, that scan will be restarted as soon as it\n\t      finishes.\n\n       A (QMGR_REQ_SCAN_ALL)\n\t      Ignore deferred queue file time stamps. The request affects the\n\t      next deferred queue scan.\n\n       F (QMGR_REQ_FLUSH_DEAD)\n\t      Purge all information about dead transports and destinations.\n\n       W (TRIGGER_REQ_WAKEUP)\n\t      Wakeup call, This is used by the master server to instantiate\n\t      servers that should not go away forever. The action is to start\n\t      an incoming queue scan.\n\n       The qmgr(8) daemon reads an entire buffer worth of triggers.  Multiple\n       identical trigger requests are collapsed into one, and trigger requests\n       are sorted so that A and F precede D and I. Thus, in order to force a\n       deferred queue run, one would request A F D; in order to notify the\n       queue manager of the arrival of new mail one would request I.\n\nSTANDARDS\n       RFC 3463 (Enhanced status codes)\n       RFC 3464 (Delivery status notifications)\n\nSECURITY\n       The qmgr(8) daemon is not security sensitive. It reads single-character\n       messages from untrusted local users, and thus may be susceptible to\n       denial of service attacks. The qmgr(8) daemon does not talk to the\n       outside world, and it can be run at fixed low privilege in a chrooted\n       environment.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Problems and transactions are logged to the syslog daemon.  Corrupted\n       message files are saved to the corrupt queue for further inspection.\n\n       Depending on the setting of the notify_classes parameter, the\n       postmaster is notified of bounces and of other trouble.\n\nBUGS\n       A single queue manager process has to compete for disk access with\n       multiple front-end processes such as cleanup(8). A sudden burst of\n       inbound mail can negatively impact outbound delivery rates.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       Changes to main.cf are not picked up automatically as qmgr(8) is a\n       persistent process. Use the \"postfix reload\" command after a\n       configuration change.\n\n       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for\n       more details including examples.\n\n       In the text below, transport is the first field in a master.cf entry.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY CONTROLS\n       Available before Postfix
