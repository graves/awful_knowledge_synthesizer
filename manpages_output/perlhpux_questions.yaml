    Manpage text:

    The HP porting centres are limited in what systems they are allowed to
           port to and they usually choose the two most recent OS versions
           available.

           HP has asked the porting centre to move Open Source binaries from /opt
           to /usr/local, so binaries produced since the start of July 2002 are
           located in /usr/local.

           One of HP porting centres URL's is <http://hpux.connect.org.uk/> The
           port currently available is built with GNU gcc. As porting modern GNU
           gcc is extremely hard on HP-UX, they are stuck at version gcc-4.2.3.

       Other prebuilt perl binaries
           To get more perl depots for the whole range of HP-UX, visit H.Merijn
           Brand's site at <http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/#Perl>.  Carefully
           read the notes to see if the available versions suit your needs.

       Compiling Perl 5 on HP-UX
           When compiling Perl, you must use an ANSI C compiler.  The C compiler
           that ships with all HP-UX systems is a K&R compiler that should only be
           used to build new kernels.

    Manpage text:

    Perl can be compiled with either HP's ANSI C compiler or with gcc.  The
           former is recommended, as not only can it compile Perl with no
           difficulty, but also can take advantage of features listed later that
           require the use of HP compiler-specific command-line flags.

           If you decide to use gcc, make sure your installation is recent and
           complete, and be sure to read the Perl INSTALL file for more gcc-
           specific details.

       PA-RISC
           The last and final version of PA-RISC is 2.0, HP no longer sells any
           system with these CPU's.

           HP's HP9000 Unix systems run on HP's own Precision Architecture (PA-
           RISC) chip.  HP-UX used to run on the Motorola MC68000 family of chips,
           but any machine with this chip in it is quite obsolete and this
           document will not attempt to address issues for compiling Perl on the

    Manpage text:

    If the referred library is an archive library, then it is treated as a
           simple collection of .o modules (all of which must contain PIC).  These
           modules are then linked into the shared library.

           Note that it is okay to create a library which contains a dependent
           library that is already linked into perl.

           Some extensions, like DB_File and Compress::Zlib use/require prebuilt
           libraries for the perl extensions/modules to work. If these libraries
           are built using the default configuration, it might happen that you run
           into an error like "invalid loader fixup" during load phase.  HP is
           aware of this problem.  Search the HP-UX cxx-dev forums for discussions
           about the subject.  The short answer is that everything (all libraries,
           everything) must be compiled with "+z" or "+Z" to be PIC (position
           independent code).  (For gcc, that would be "-fpic" or "-fPIC").  In
           HP-UX 11.00 or newer the linker error message should tell the name of
           the offending object file.

    Threaded Perl on HP-UX
           It is possible to compile a version of threaded Perl on any version of
           HP-UX before 10.30, but it is strongly suggested that you be running on
           HP-UX 11.00 at least.

           To compile Perl with threads, add -Dusethreads to the arguments of
           Configure.  Verify that the -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L compiler flag is
           automatically added to the list of flags.  Also make sure that
           -lpthread is listed before -lc in the list of libraries to link Perl
           with. The hints provided for HP-UX during Configure will try very hard
           to get this right for you.

           HP-UX versions before 10.30 require a separate installation of a POSIX
           threads library package. Two examples are the HP DCE package, available
           on "HP-UX Hardware Extensions 3.0, Install and Core OS, Release 10.20,
           April 1999 (B3920-13941)" or the Freely available PTH package,
           available on H.Merijn's site (<http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/>).
           The use of PTH will be unsupported in perl-5.12 and up and is rather
