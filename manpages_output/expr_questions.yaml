Several\n     of the operators have special meaning to command interpreters and must\n     therefore be quoted appropriately.  All integer operands are interpreted\n     in base 10 and must consist of only an optional leading minus sign\n     followed by one or more digits.\n\n     Arithmetic operations are performed using signed integer math with a\n     range according to the C intmax_t data type (the largest signed integral\n     type available).  All conversions and operations are checked for\n     overflow.\tOverflow results in program termination with an error message\n     on stdout and with an error status.\n\n     Operators are listed below in order of increasing precedence; all are\n     left-associative.\tOperators with equal precedence are grouped within\n     symbols ‘{’ and ‘}’."
