It is therefore usual to set the month before\n\t     setting the day; using -v 12m -v 31d always works.\n\n\t     Adjusting the date by months is inherently ambiguous because a\n\t     month is a unit of variable length depending on the current date.\n\t     This kind of date adjustment is applied in the most intuitive\n\t     way.  First of all, date tries to preserve the day of the month.\n\t     If it is impossible because the target month is shorter than the\n\t     present one, the last day of the target month will be the result.\n\t     For example, using -v +1m on May 31 will adjust the date to June\n\t     30, while using the same option on January 30 will result in the\n\t     date adjusted to the last day of February.  This approach is also\n\t     believed to make the most sense for shell scripting.\n\t     Nevertheless, be aware that going forth and back by the same\n\t     number of months may take you to a different date."
