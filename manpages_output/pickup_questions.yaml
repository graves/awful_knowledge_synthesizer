This\n       program expects to be run from the master(8) process manager.\n\nSTANDARDS\n       None. The pickup(8) daemon does not interact with the outside world.\n\nSECURITY\n       The pickup(8) daemon is moderately security sensitive. It runs with\n       fixed low privilege and can run in a chrooted environment.  However,\n       the program reads files from potentially hostile users.\tThe pickup(8)\n       daemon opens no files for writing, is careful about what files it opens\n       for reading, and does not actually touch any data that is sent to its\n       public service endpoint.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).\n\nBUGS\n       The pickup(8) daemon copies mail from file to the cleanup(8) daemon.\n       It could avoid message copying overhead by sending a file descriptor\n       instead of file data, but then the already complex cleanup(8) daemon\n       would have to deal with unfiltered user data.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       As the pickup(8) daemon is a relatively long-running process, up to an\n       hour may pass before a main.cf change takes effect.  Use the command\n       \"postfix reload\" command to speed up a change.\n\n       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for\n       more details including examples.\n\nCONTENT INSPECTION CONTROLS\n\n       content_filter (empty)\n\t      After the message is queued, send the entire message to the\n\t      specified transport:destination.\n\n       receive_override_options (empty)\n\t      Enable or disable recipient validation, built-in content\n\t      filtering, or address mapping.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS CONTROLS\n\n       config_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf\n\t      configuration files.\n\n       ipc_timeout (3600s)\n\t      The time limit for sending or receiving information over an\n\t      internal communication channel.\n\n       line_length_limit (2048)\n\t      Upon input, long lines are chopped up into pieces of at most\n\t      this length; upon delivery, long lines are reconstructed.\n\n       max_idle (100s)\n\t      The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix daemon process\n\t      waits for an incoming connection before terminating voluntarily.\n\n       max_use (100)\n\t      The maximal number of incoming connections that a Postfix daemon\n\t      process will service before terminating voluntarily.\n\n       process_id (read-only)\n\t      The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.\n\n       process_name (read-only)\n\t      The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.\n\n       queue_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      The location of the Postfix top-level queue directory.\n\n       syslog_facility (mail)\n\t      The syslog facility of Postfix logging.\n\n       syslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      A prefix that is prepended to the process name in syslog\n\t      records, so that, for example, \"smtpd\" becomes \"prefix/smtpd\".\n\nSEE ALSO\n       cleanup(8), message canonicalization\n       sendmail(1), Sendmail-compatible interface\n       postdrop(1), mail posting agent\n       postconf(5), configuration parameters\n       master(5), generic daemon options\n       master(8), process manager\n       syslogd(8), system logging\n\nLICENSE\n       The Secure Mailer license must be distributed with this software.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n       Wietse Venema\n       IBM T.J.
