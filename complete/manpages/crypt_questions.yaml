Additional code has been added to deter key\n     search attempts.  The first argument to crypt() is a null-terminated\n     string, typically a user's typed password.  The second is in one of two\n     forms: if it begins with an underscore (``_''), an extended format is\n     used in interpreting both the key and the salt value, as outlined below.\n\n   Extended crypt:\n     The key is divided into groups of 8 characters (the last group is null-\n     padded) and the low-order 7 bits of each each character (56 bits per\n     group) are used to form the DES key as follows: the first group of 56\n     bits becomes the initial DES key.\tFor each additional group, the XOR of\n     the encryption of the current DES key with itself and the group bits\n     becomes the next DES key."

    Manpage text:

    The salt is a 9-character array consisting of an underscore, followed by
         4 bytes of iteration count and 4 bytes of salt.  These are encoded as
         printable characters, 6 bits per character, least significant character
         first.  The values 0 to 63 are encoded as ``./0-9A-Za-z''.  This allows
         24 bits for both count and salt.

       Traditional crypt:
         The first 8 bytes of the key are null-padded, and the low-order 7 bits of
         each character is used to form the 56-bit DES key.

         The salt is a 2-character array of the ASCII-encoded salt.  Thus, only 12
         bits of salt are used.  count is set to 25.

       Algorithm:
         The salt introduces disorder in the DES algorithm in one of 16777216 or
         4096 possible ways (ie. with 24 or 12 bits: if bit i of the salt is set,
         then bits i and i+24 are swapped in the DES E-box output).

         The DES key is used to encrypt a 64-bit constant, using count iterations
         of DES.  The value returned is a null-terminated string, 20 or 13 bytes
         (plus null) in length, consisting of the salt, followed by the encoded
         64-bit encryption.

    Manpage text:

    The function encrypt() returns 0 on success and 1 on failure.

         void
         setkey(const char *key);

         The include file <unistd.h> is necessary and sufficient for the setkey()
         function.

    BUGS
         The crypt() function returns a pointer to static data, and subsequent
         calls to crypt() will modify the same object.

    HISTORY
         A rotor-based crypt() function appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.  The
         current style crypt() first appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.

         This library (FreeSec 1.0) was developed outside the United States of
         America as an unencumbered replacement for the U.S.-only libcrypt
         encryption library.  Programs linked against the crypt() interface may be
         exported from the U.S.A. only if they use crypt() solely for
         authentication purposes and avoid use of the other programmer interfaces
         listed above. Special care has been taken in the library so that programs
         which only use the crypt() interface do not pull in the other components.
