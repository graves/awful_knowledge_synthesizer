If there are more variable names than list elements, the\n       remaining variables are set to the empty string.  If there are more\n       list elements than variables, a list of unassigned elements is\n       returned.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       An illustration of how multiple assignment works, and what happens when\n       there are either too few or too many elements.\n\t      lassign {a b c} x y z\t  ;# Empty return\n\t      puts $x\t\t\t  ;# Prints \"a\"\n\t      puts $y\t\t\t  ;# Prints \"b\"\n\t      puts $z\t\t\t  ;# Prints \"c\"\n\n\t      lassign {d e} x y z\t  ;# Empty return\n\t      puts $x\t\t\t  ;# Prints \"d\"\n\t      puts $y\t\t\t  ;# Prints \"e\"\n\t      puts $z\t\t\t  ;# Prints \"\"\n\n\t      lassign {f g h i} x y\t  ;# Returns \"h i\"\n\t      puts $x\t\t\t  ;# Prints \"f\"\n\t      puts $y\t\t\t  ;# Prints \"g\"\n       The lassign command has other uses.  It can be used to create the\n       analogue of the “shift” command in many shell languages like this:\n\t      set ::argv [lassign $::argv argumentToReadOff]\n\nSEE ALSO\n       lindex(n), list(n), lset(n), set(n)"
