See the StorNext Windows \"Gather Debugging Info\n       (cvgather.exe)\" help page for more information.)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       cvgather -f_VolName [-sukxr] [-o OutputFile] [-n NumberOfCvlogs]\n\t      [-U UserCore] [-K KernelCore] [-p SnfsPath]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The cvgather program is used to collect debug information from a\n       volume.\tThis creates a tar file of the system's Xsan File System debug\n       logs, configuration, version information and disk devices.\n\n       The cvgather program will collect client debug information on client\n       machines and server information on server machines, as well as\n       portmapper information from all machines. System log files as well as\n       Xsan log files are included.  At the users option, cvgather also\n       collects core files from user space utilities, such as the fsm, and\n       also from the operating system kernel, when available.\n\nUSAGE\n       When the operator encounters an error using Xsan and wishes to send\n       debugging information to Apple technical support, the cvgather utility\n       may be run.  The following command arguments and options affect the\n       behavior of cvgather."

    Manpage text:

    When cvgather is run it will create a tar file, that can be simply e-
           mailed to Apple technical support for evaluation. It is recommended
           that the tar file be compressed into a standard compression format such
           as compress, gzip, or bzip2.

    NOTES
           IMPORTANT: cvgather creates a number of temporary files, thus must have
           write privileges for the directory in which it is run. These files, as
           well as the output tar file can be very large, especially when the
           kernel core file is included, thus adequate disk space must be
           available.

           Several important log files are only accessible by the root user, thus
           it is important that cvgather be run with root privileges to gather the
           entire range of useful information.
