The\n       package implements both active (default) and passive ftp sessions.\n\n       A new ftp session is started with the ::ftp::Open command. To shutdown\n       an existing ftp session use ::ftp::Close. All other commands are\n       restricted to usage in an an open ftp session. They will generate\n       errors if they are used out of context.\tThe ftp package includes file\n       and directory manipulating commands for remote sites. To perform the\n       same operations on the local site use commands built into the core,\n       like cd or file.\n\n       The output of the package is controlled by two state variables,\n       ::ftp::VERBOSE and ::ftp::DEBUG. Setting ::ftp::VERBOSE to \"1\" forces\n       the package to show all responses from a remote server. The default\n       value is \"0\". Setting ::ftp::DEBUG to \"1\" enables debugging and forces\n       the package to show all return codes, states, state changes and \"real\"\n       ftp commands. The default value is \"0\"."

    Manpage text:

    The command ::ftp::DisplayMsg is used to show the different messages
           from the ftp session. The setting of ::ftp::VERBOSE determines if this
           command is called or not. The current implementation of the command
           uses the log package of tcllib to write the messages to their final
           destination. This means that the behaviour of ::ftp::DisplayMsg can be
           customized without changing its implementation. For more radical
           changes overwriting its implementation by the application is of course
           still possible. Note that the default implementation honors the option
           -output to ::ftp::Open for a session specific log command.

           Caution: The default implementation logs error messages like all other
           messages. If this behaviour is changed to throwing an error instead all
           commands in the API will change their behaviour too. In such a case
           they will not return a failure code as described below but pass the
           thrown error to their caller.
