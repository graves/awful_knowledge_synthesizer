Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `uuto`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nuuto(1) \t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t       uuto(1)\n\nNAME\n       uuto - send files to a particular user on a remote system\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       uuto files... system!user\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The uuto program may be used to conveniently send files to a particular\n       user on a remote system.  It will arrange for mail to be sent to the\n       remote user when the files arrive on the remote system, and he or she\n       may easily retrieve the files using the uupick program.\tNote that uuto\n       does not provide any security--any user on the remote system can\n       examine the files.\n\n       The last argument specifies the system and user name to which to send\n       the files.  The other arguments are the files or directories to be\n       sent.\n\n       The uuto program is actually just a trivial shell script which invokes\n       the uucp program with the appropriate arguments.\n\nOPTIONS\n       Any option which may be given to uucp may also be given to uuto.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       uucp(1), uupick(1)\n\nAUTHOR\n       Ian Lance Taylor <ian@airs.com>.  Text for this Manpage comes from\n       Taylor UUCP, version 1.07 Info documentation."
