A new log file will\n\t     be created. The attributable flags parameter from the\n\t     audit_control(5) configuration file is set at login time and is\n\t     not synchronized with this flag.\n\n     -t      Specifies that the audit system should terminate.\tLog files are\n\t     closed and renamed to indicate the time of the shutdown.\n\n     -c      Specifies that audit should query the audit condition and exit\n\t     successfully only if auditing is enabled in the kernel."
