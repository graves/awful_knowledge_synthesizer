    Manpage text:

    Each argument that contains an exclamation point is treated as naming a
           file.  The system which the file is on is before the exclamation point,
           and the pathname on that system follows it.  An empty system name is
           taken as the local system; this must be used to transfer a file to a
           command being executed on a remote system.  If the path is not
           absolute, it will be appended to the current working directory on the
           local system; the result may not be meaningful on the remote system.  A
           pathname may begin with ~/, in which case it is relative to the UUCP
           public directory (usually /usr/spool/uucppublic or
           /var/spool/uucppublic) on the appropriate system.  A pathname may begin
           with ~name/, in which case it is relative to the home directory of the
           named user on the appropriate system.

           Standard input and output may be redirected as usual; the pathnames
           used may contain exclamation points to indicate that they are on remote
           systems.  Note that the redirection characters must be quoted so that
           they are passed to uux rather than interpreted by the shell.  Append
           redirection (>>) does not work.

    Manpage text:

    uux 'diff -c sys1!~user1/file1 sys2!~user2/file2 >!file.diff'
           Fetch the two named files from system sys1 and system sys2 and execute
           diff putting the result in file.diff in the current directory.  The
           current directory must be writable by the uuxqt (8) daemon for this to
           work.

           uux 'sys1!uucp ~user1/file1 (sys2!~user2/file2)'
           Execute uucp on the system sys1 copying file1 (on system sys1) to sys2.
           This illustrates the use of parentheses for quoting.

    RESTRICTIONS
           The remote system may not permit you to execute certain commands.  Many
           remote systems only permit the execution of rmail and rnews.

           Some of the options are dependent on the capabilities of the uuxqt (8)
           daemon on the remote system.

    SEE ALSO
           mail(1), uustat(1), uucp(1), uucico(8), uuxqt(8)

    BUGS
           Files can not be referenced across multiple systems.

           Too many jobids are output by --jobid, and there is no good way to
           cancel a local execution requiring remote files.
