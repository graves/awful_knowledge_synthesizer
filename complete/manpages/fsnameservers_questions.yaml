The volume name coordinators are\n       a critical component of the Xsan File System Services (FSS). One of the\n       principal functions of the coordinator is to manage failover voting in\n       a high availability configuration. Therefore it is crucial to choose\n       highly reliable systems as the coordinators. Redundancy is provided by\n       listing multiple entries in the fsnameservers file, one entry per line.\n       When Xsan services are started on a host, the fsmpm daemon sends a\n       heartbeat to each coordinator in the list. The first response received\n       determines the primary coordinator for that client in a given cluster.\n       The remaining coordinators are backup coordinators and will be used if\n       the primary is lost.  It is recommended to configure at least two\n       systems per cluster to utilize this redundancy benefit.\tThe systems\n       chosen may also be configured for the File System Manager (FSM)\n       services but this is not required."

The fsnameservers files on the client and MDC hosts normally\n       contain all these addresses as well, but these hosts will function\n       normally with the address of at least one active coordinator.\n\n       If you are configuring multiple clusters, it is best practices to\n       include the cluster and the administrative_domain on the same line as\n       the IP address of each coordinator (see below).\n\n       See the fsmcluster(4) man page for a discussion on Xsan clusters and\n       administrative domains.\n\n       If fsnameservers does not exist then the system will operate as a\n       \"local\" filesystem representing both client and server.

    Manpage text:

    The fsnameservers file is also used to specify the preferred metadata
           network(s) used for Xsan.  That is, if an address in the fsnameservers
           file is on IP network x, then network x will be used to carry Xsan
           metadata traffic, if possible. Networks available over other interfaces
           will be used if there is no connectivity from a client to the FSM on a
           preferred network.  A network other than preferred will also be
           selected if this network is directly connected (on the same subnet) and
           none of the preferred networks are directly connected.  Multiple,
           redundant metadata networks can be created by using additional network
           interfaces on every system; each coordinator is then specified in
           fsnameservers multiple times, once for each of its metadata-network
           addresses.

           It is possible to filter the networks or IP addresses that are
           advertised to clients using the snfs_metadata_network_filter.json
           configuration file. See the snfs_metadata_network_filter.json(5) man
           page for details.  This capability is only offerred on Linux systems.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `fsnameservers`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nProxy coordinators can be configured by specifying a masklength along\n       with the IP address.  A proxy coordinator acts as a coordinator for\n       other clients on the same subnet, relaying information between the\n       clients and the real coordinators.  For a group of clients on the same\n       subnet, this will keep the underlying heartbeat traffic localized to\n       the subnet, and only the proxies will communicate with the real\n       coordinators.  When configured, clients on the same subnet as the proxy\n       will prefer to use the proxy coordinator for their primary coordinator.\n       If the proxy coordinators are non-responsive, clients will fall back to\n       using the normal coordinators.\n\nUPDATING fsnameservers\n       NOTE The following applies to Xsan coordinators, clients and MDCs that\n       have been updated to a level that supports this procedure. Verify that\n       this text is present in this man page on these nodes before proceeding.\n\n       If a set of coordinators for a cluster is being replaced, the old\n       coordinators should remain active through the transition.  The first\n       step is to synchronize the new and old coordinators.  Populate the\n       fsnameservers file on all coordinators with the IP addresses of all the\n       coordinators. Then start or restart services on all coordinators.  Once\n       this is done, all clients and MDCs will dynamically learn the location\n       of the new coordinators through the NSS protocol.  This can be verified\n       with the coord subcommand of the cvadmin utility. You should see\n       entries for the old and new coordinators.  Next, update all of the\n       clients and MDCs fsnameservers files to contain only the addresses of\n       just the new coordinators.  There is no urgency to update the clients\n       and MDCs as long as at least one of the old coordinators remains\n       active.\tWhen all the client and MDC fsnameservers files have been\n       updated, the old coordinators can be taken off line. The clients and\n       MDCs will now switch over to the new coordinators for primary and\n       secondary.  The fsnameservers file on the new coordinators should now\n       be updated to contain only the new coordinator names or addresses.\n       There is no need to restart services on any of the clients or MDCs."

If, for example, a coordinator node failed, a new\n       coordinator node can be brought on line with the new coordinator\n       configuration in its fsnameservers file. Next, the existing\n       coordinators should have their fsnameservers files updated. Start or\n       restart services on all coordinators.  Then, as above, update all the\n       client and MDC fsnameservers files.\n\nSYNTAX\n       The format for the fsnameservers is simple. It contains the IP address\n       or the hostname to use as either a primary or a secondary coordinator.\n       The use of IP addresses is preferred to avoid problems associated with\n       lookup system (eg., DNS or NIS) failures. The format of an\n       fsnameservers line is:\n\n\t      host[/masklength][ ][@[cluster[/admin_domain]]]\n\n\t      The host is a host name or IP address of a host that can\n\t      coordinate queries and failover votes for the File System\n\t      Services.  The optional cluster and admin_domain fields specify\n\t      the name of the cluster and administrative domain to which the\n\t      coordinator belongs.  To specify that host is a coordinator for\n\t      more than one cluster, there must be a line for each cluster."
