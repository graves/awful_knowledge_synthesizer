It should be fairly straight forward\n       to use.\tMerely run it and answer its questions.\n\n       In its default mode of operation, it prompts the user with menus\n       showing sections of the various configuration files it knows about.\n       When the user selects a section, a sub-menu is shown listing of the\n       descriptions of the tokens that can be created in that section.\tWhen a\n       description is selected, the user is prompted with questions that\n       construct the configuration line in question.\n\n       Finally, when the user quits the program any configuration files that\n       have been edited by the user are saved to the local directory, fully\n       commented."
