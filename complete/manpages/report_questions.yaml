The report objects defined here break each\n       report down into three REGIONS and ten classes of lines (various\n       separator- and data-lines). See the following section for more detailed\n       explanations.\n\n       ::report::report reportName columns ?style style arg...?\n\t      Creates a new report object for a report having columns columns\n\t      with an associated global Tcl command whose name is reportName.\n\t      This command may be used to invoke various configuration\n\t      operations on the report. It has the following general form:\n\n\t      reportName option ?arg arg ...?\n\t\t     Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the\n\t\t     command. See section REPORT METHODS for more\n\t\t     explanations. If no style is specified the report will\n\t\t     use the builtin style plain as its default configuration.\n\n       ::report::defstyle styleName arguments script\n\t      Defines the new style styleName. See section STYLES for more\n\t      information.\n\n       ::report::rmstyle styleName\n\t      Deletes the style styleName. Trying to delete an unknown or\n\t      builtin style will result in an error. Beware, this command will\n\t      not check that there are no other styles depending on the\n\t      deleted one. Deleting a style which is still used by another\n\t      style FOO will result in a runtime error when FOO is applied to\n\t      a newly instantiated report.\n\n       ::report::stylearguments styleName\n\t      This introspection command returns the list of arguments\n\t      associated with the style styleName.\n\n       ::report::stylebody styleName\n\t      This introspection command returns the script associated with\n\t      the style styleName.\n\n       ::report::styles\n\t      This introspection command returns a list containing the names\n\t      of all styles known to the package at the time of the call. The\n\t      order of the names in the list reflects the order in which the\n\t      styles were created. In other words, the first item is the\n\t      predefined style plain, followed by the first style defined by\n\t      the user, and so on.\n\nREGIONS\n       The three regions are the top caption, data area and bottom caption.\n       These are, roughly speaking, the title, the values to report and a\n       title at the bottom. The size of the caption regions can be specified\n       by the user as the number of rows they occupy in the matrix to format.\n       The size of the data area is specified implicitly.\n\nLINES\n       TEMPLATES are associated with each of the ten line classes, defining\n       the formatting for this kind of line. The user is able to enable and\n       disable the separator lines at will, but not the data lines. Their\n       usage is solely determined by the number of rows contained in the three\n       regions. Data lines and all enabled separators must have a template\n       associated with them.\n\n       Note that the data-lines in a report and the rows in the matrix the\n       report was generated from are not in a 1:1 relationship if any row in\n       the matrix has a height greater than one.\n\n       The different kinds of lines and the codes used by the report methods\n       to address them are:\n\n       top    The topmost line of a report. Separates the report from anything\n\t      which came before it. The user can enable the usage of this line\n\t      at will.\n\n       topdatasep\n\t      This line is used to separate the data rows in the top caption\n\t      region, if it contains more than one row and the user enabled\n\t      its usage.\n\n       topcapsep\n\t      This line is used to separate the top caption and data regions,\n\t      if the top caption is not empty and the user enabled its usage.\n\n       datasep\n\t      This line is used to separate the data rows in the data region,\n\t      if it contains more than one row and the user enabled its usage.\n\n       botcapsep\n\t      This line is used to separate the data and bottom caption\n\t      regions, if the bottom caption is not empty and the user enabled\n\t      its usage.\n\n       botdatasep\n\t      This line is used to separate the data rows in the bottom\n\t      caption region, if it contains more than one row and the user\n\t      enabled its usage.\n\n       bottom The bottommost line of a report. Separates the report from\n\t      anything which comes after it. The user can enable the usage of\n\t      this line at will.\n\n       topdata\n\t      This line defines the format of data lines in the top caption\n\t      region of the report.\n\n       data   This line defines the format of data lines in the data region of\n\t      the report.\n\n       botdata\n\t      This line defines the format of data lines in the bottom caption\n\t      region of the report.\n\nTEMPLATES\n       Each template is a list of strings used to format the line it is\n       associated with. For a report containing n columns a template for a\n       data line has to contain \"n+1\" items and a template for a separator\n       line \"2*n+1\" items.\n\n       The items in a data template specify the strings used to separate the\n       column information. Together with the corresponding items in the\n       separator templates they form the vertical lines in the report.\n\n       Note that the corresponding items in all defined templates have to be\n       of equal length. This will be checked by the report object. The first\n       item defines the leftmost vertical line and the last item defines the\n       rightmost vertical line. The item at index k (\"1\",...,\"n-2\") separates\n       the information in the columns \"k-1\" and \"k\".\n\n       The items in a separator template having an even-numbered index\n       (\"0\",\"2\",...)  specify the column separators. The item at index \"2*k\"\n       (\"0\",\"2\",...,\"2*n\") corresponds to the items at index \"k\" in the data\n       templates.\n\n       The items in a separator template having an odd-numbered index\n       (\"1\",\"3\",...) specify the strings used to form the horizontal lines in\n       the separator lines. The item at index \"2*k+1\" (\"1\",\"3\",...,\"2*n+1\")\n       corresponds to column \"k\". When generating the horizontal lines the\n       items are replicated to be at least as long as the size of their column\n       and then cut to the exact size.\n\nSTYLES\n       Styles are a way for the user of this package to define common\n       configurations for report objects and then use them later during the\n       actual instantiation of report objects. They are defined as tcl scripts\n       which when executed configure the report object into the requested\n       configuration.\n\n       The command to define styles is ::report::defstyle. Its last argument\n       is the tcl script performing the actual reconfiguration of the report\n       object to obtain the requested style.\n\n       In this script the names of all previously defined styles are available\n       as commands, as are all commands found in a safe interpreter and the\n       configuration methods of report objects. The latter implicitly operate\n       on the object currently executing the style script. The arguments\n       declared here are available in the script as variables. When calling\n       the command of a previously declared style all the arguments expected\n       by it have to be defined in the call.\n\nREPORT METHODS\n       The following commands are possible for report objects:\n\n       reportName destroy\n\t      Destroys the report, including its storage space and associated\n\t      command.\n\n       reportName templatecode disable|enable\n\t      Enables or disables the usage of the template addressed by the\n\t      templatecode. Only the codes for separator lines are allowed\n\t      here. It is not possible to enable or disable data lines.\n\n\t      Enabling a template causes the report to check all used\n\t      templates for inconsistencies in the definition of the vertical\n\t      lines (See section TEMPLATES).\n\n       reportName templatecode enabled\n\t      Returns the whether the template addressed by the templatecode\n\t      is currently enabled or not.\n\n       reportName templatecode get\n\t      Returns the template currently associated with the kind of line\n\t      addressed by the templatecode. All known templatecodes are\n\t      allowed here.\n\n       reportName templatecode set templatedata\n\t      Sets the template associated with the kind of line addressed by\n\t      the templatecode to the new value in templatedata. See section\n\t      TEMPLATES for constraints on the length of templates.\n\n       reportName tcaption ?size?\n\t      Specifies the size of the top caption region as the number rows\n\t      it occupies in the matrix to be formatted. Only numbers greater\n\t      than or equal to zero are allowed. If no size is specified the\n\t      command will return the current size instead.\n\n\t      Setting the size of the top caption to a value greater than zero\n\t      enables the corresponding data template and causes the report to\n\t      check all used templates for inconsistencies in the definition\n\t      of the vertical lines (See section TEMPLATES).\n\n       reportName bcaption size\n\t      Specifies the size of the bottom caption region as the number\n\t      rows it occupies in the matrix to be formatted. Only numbers\n\t      greater than or equal to zero are allowed. If no size is\n\t      specified the command will return the current size instead.\n\n\t      Setting the size of the bottom caption to a value greater than\n\t      zero enables the corresponding data template and causes the\n\t      report to check all used templates for inconsistencies in the\n\t      definition of the vertical lines (See section TEMPLATES).\n\n       reportName size column ?number|dyn?\n\t      Specifies the size of the column in the output. The value dyn\n\t      means that the columnwidth returned by the matrix to be\n\t      formatted for the specified column shall be used. The formatting\n\t      of the column is dynamic. If a fixed number is used instead of\n\t      dyn it means that the column has a width of that many characters\n\t      (padding excluded). Only numbers greater than zero are allowed\n\t      here.\n\n\t      If no size specification is given the command will return the\n\t      current size of the column instead.\n\n       reportName sizes ?size-list?\n\t      This method allows the user to specify the sizes of all columns\n\t      in one call. Its argument is a list containing the sizes to\n\t      associate with the columns. The first item is associated with\n\t      column 0, the next with column 1, and so on.\n\n\t      If no size-list is specified the command will return a list\n\t      containing the currently set sizes instead.\n\n       reportName pad column ?left|right|both ?padstring??\n\t      This method allows the user to specify padding on the left,\n\t      right or both sides of a column. If the padstring is not\n\t      specified it defaults to a single space character. Note: An\n\t      alternative way of specifying the padding is to use vertical\n\t      separator strings longer than one character in the templates\n\t      (See section TEMPLATES).\n\n\t      If no pad specification is given at all the command will return\n\t      the current state of padding for the column instead. This will\n\t      be a list containing two elements, the first element the left\n\t      padding, the second describing the right padding.\n\n       reportName justify column ?left|right|center?\n\t      Declares how the cell values for a column are filled into the\n\t      report given the specified size of a column in the report.\n\n\t      For left and right justification a cell value shorter than the\n\t      width of the column is bound with its named edge to the same\n\t      edge of the column. The other side is filled with spaces. In the\n\t      case of center the spaces are placed to both sides of the value\n\t      and the left number of spaces is at most one higher than the\n\t      right number of spaces.\n\n\t      For a value longer than the width of the column the value is cut\n\t      at the named edge. This means for left justification that the\n\t      tail (i.e. the right part) of the value is made visible in the\n\t      output. For center the value is cut at both sides to fit into\n\t      the column and the number of characters cut at the left side of\n\t      the value is at most one less than the number of characters cut\n\t      from the right side.\n\n\t      If no justification was specified the command will return the\n\t      current justification for the column instead.\n\n       reportName printmatrix matrix\n\t      Formats the matrix according to the configuration of the report\n\t      and returns the resulting string. The matrix has to have the\n\t      same number of columns as the report. The matrix also has to\n\t      have enough rows so that the top and bottom caption regions do\n\t      not overlap. The data region is allowed to be empty.\n\n       reportName printmatrix2channel matrix chan\n\t      Formats the matrix according to the configuration of the report\n\t      and writes the result into the channel chan. The matrix has to\n\t      have the same number of columns as the report. The matrix also\n\t      has to have enough rows so that the top and bottom caption\n\t      regions do not overlap. The data region is allowed to be empty.\n\n       reportName columns\n\t      Returns the number of columns in the report.\n\n       The methods size, pad and justify all take a column index as their\n       first argument. This index is allowed to use all the forms of an index\n       as accepted by the lindex command. The allowed range for indices is\n       \"0,...,[reportName columns]-1\".\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Our examples define some generally useful report styles.\n\n       A simple table with lines surrounding all information and vertical\n       separators, but without internal horizontal separators."
