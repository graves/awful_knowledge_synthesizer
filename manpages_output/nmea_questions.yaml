It allows for reading data from COM\n       ports, files, or programmatic input. It also supports the checksumming\n       and logging of incoming data.  After parsing, input is dispatched to\n       user defined handler commands for processing.  To define a handler, see\n       the event command. There are no GPS specific functions in this package.\n       NMEA data consists of a sentence type, followed by a list of data.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::nmea::input sentence\n\t      Processes and dispatches the supplied sentence. If sentence\n\t      contains no commas it is treated as a Tcl list, otherwise it\n\t      must be standard comma delimited NMEA data, with an optional\n\t      checksum and leading $.\n\n\t      nmea::input {$GPGSA,A,3,04,05,,09,12,,,24,,,,,2.5,1.3,2.1*39}\n\t      nmea::input [list GPGSA A 3 04 05  09 12 \"\" \"\" 24 \"\" \"\" \"\"  2.5 1.3 2.1]"

  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the nmea command to process a specific NMEA sentence, such as $GPGSA,A,3,04,05,,09,12,,,24,,,,,2.5,1.3,2.1*39?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the nmea command to open a serial port and configure it for NMEA data reception?

Port speed is set to 4800bps by default or to speed.\n\n       ::nmea::close_port\n\t      Close the com port connection if one is open.\n\n       ::nmea::configure_port settings\n\t      Changes the current port settings. settings has the same format\n\t      as fconfigure -mode.\n\n       ::nmea::open_file file ?rate?\n\t      Open file file and read NMEA sentences, one per line, at the\n\t      rate specified by ?rate? in milliseconds.  The file format may\n\t      omit the leading $ and/or the checksum. If rate is <= 0 (the\n\t      default) then lines will only be processed when a call to\n\t      do_line is made.\n\n       ::nmea::close_file\n\t      Close the open file if one exists.\n\n       ::nmea::do_line\n\t      If there is a currently open file, this command will read and\n\t      process a single line from it.  Returns the number of lines\n\t      read.\n\n       ::nmea::rate\n\t      Sets the rate at which lines are processed from the open file,\n\t      in milliseconds. The rate remains consistant across files, there\n\t      does not need to be a file currently open to use this command.\n\t      Set to 0 to disable automatic line processing.\n\n       ::nmea::log ?file?\n\t      Starts or stops input logging. If a file name is specified then\n\t      all NMEA data recieved on the open port will be logged to the\n\t      ?file? in append mode. If file is an empty string then any\n\t      logging will be stopped. If no file is specified then returns a\n\t      boolean value indicating if logging is currently enabled. Data\n\t      written to the port by write, data read from files, or input\n\t      made using input, is not logged.\n\n       ::nmea::checksum data\n\t      Returns the checksum of the supplied data.\n\n       ::nmea::write sentence data\n\t      If there is a currently open port, this command will write the\n\t      specified sentence and data to the port in proper NMEA\n\t      checksummed format.\n\n       ::nmea::event setence ?command?\n\t      Registers a handler proc for a given NMEA sentence. There may be\n\t      at most one handler per sentence, any existing handler is\n\t      replaced.  If no command is specified, returns the name of the\n\t      current handler for the given setence or an empty string if none\n\t      exists. In addition to the incoming sentences there are 2\n\t      builtin types, EOF and DEFAULT. The handler for the DEFAULT\n\t      setence is invoked if there is not a specific handler for that\n\t      sentence. The EOF handler is invoked when End Of File is reached\n\t      on the open file or port.\n\n\t      The handler procedures, with the exception of the builtin\n\t      types,must take exactly one argument, which is a list of the\n\t      data values.  The DEFAULT handler should have two arguments, the\n\t      sentence type and the data values.  The EOF handler has no\n\t      arguments.\n\n\t      nmea::event gpgsa parse_sat_detail\n\t      nmea::event default handle_unknown\n\n\t      proc parse_sat_detail {data} {\n\t\t  puts [lindex $data 1]\n\t      }\n\n\t      proc handle_unknown {name data} {\n\t\t  puts \"unknown data type $name\"\n\t      }"
