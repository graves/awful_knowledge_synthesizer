This condensation is desirable because on a large system,\n     /var/account/acct can grow by hundreds of blocks per day.\tThe summary\n     files are normally read before the accounting file, so that reports\n     include all available information.\n\n     If file names are supplied, they are read instead of /var/account/acct.\n     After each file is read, if the summary files are being updated, an\n     updated summary will be saved to disk.  Only one report is printed, after\n     the last file is processed."

In particular, the -q\n     option has been added, and the -m option now understands more options\n     than it used to.\n\n     The formats of the summary files created by this version of sa are very\n     different from the those used by the original version.  This is not\n     considered a problem, however, because the accounting record format has\n     changed as well (since user ids are now 32 bits).\n\nBUGS\n     The number of options to this program is absurd, especially considering\n     that there is not much logic behind their lettering."
