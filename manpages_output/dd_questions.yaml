Input\n     data is read and written in 512-byte blocks.  If input reads are short,\n     input from multiple reads are aggregated to form the output block.  When\n     finished, dd displays the number of complete and partial input and output\n     blocks and truncated input records to the standard error output.\n\n     The following operands are available:\n\n     bs=n     Set both input and output block size to n bytes, superseding the\n\t      ibs and obs operands.  If no conversion values other than\n\t      noerror, notrunc or sync are specified, then each input block is\n\t      copied to the output as a single block without any aggregation\n\t      of short blocks.\n\n     cbs=n    Set the conversion record size to n bytes.  The conversion\n\t      record size is required by the record oriented conversion\n\t      values."
