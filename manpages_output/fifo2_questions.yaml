Use the CVS to get the sources.\n\n       fifo2  creates two stream-oriented in-memory channels and returns their\n\t      handles as a two-element list. There is no restriction on the\n\t      ultimate size of the channels, they will always grow as much as\n\t      is necessary to accomodate the data written into them.\n\n\t      In contrast to the channels generated by fifo a pair of channels\n\t      created here is connected internally in such a way that data\n\t      written into one channel can be read from the other. All data\n\t      written into them is read in the same order. This also means\n\t      that the two channels of the pair are not seekable.\n\n\t      The channels created here can be transfered between interpreters\n\t      in the same thread and between threads. As both channels in the\n\t      pair can be transfered independently they can be used to create\n\t      a bidirectional connection between two interpreters.\n\n       Memory channels created by fifo2 provide two read-only options which\n       can be queried via the standard fconfigure command. These are\n\n       -rlength\n\t      The value of this option is the number of bytes currently\n\t      available for reading from the channel.\n\n       -wlength\n\t      The value of this option is the number of bytes currently\n\t      written into the channel.\n\n       Note that the two lengths are switched for the channels of a pair. In\n       other words, the number of bytes written for one of the channels is the\n       number of bytes readable from the other end.\n\n       As the channels generated by fifo2 grow as necessary they are always\n       writable. This means that a writable fileevent-handler will fire\n       continuously.\n\n       The channels are also readable if they contain more than zero bytes.\n       Under this conditions a readable fileevent-handler will fire\n       continuously.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       fifo, memchan, null\n\nKEYWORDS\n       channel, fifo, i/o, in-memory channel, memchan, stream\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 1996-2003 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
