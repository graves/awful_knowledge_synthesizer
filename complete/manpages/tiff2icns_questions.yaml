Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tiff2icns`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nTIFF2ICNS(1)\t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t  TIFF2ICNS(1)\n\nNAME\n     tiff2icns â€“ converts TIFF to icns format\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     tiff2icns [-noLarge] infile [outfile]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     tiff2icns can be used to convert TIFF images to 'icns' files used by Icon\n     Services.\n\n     Searches for 48, 32, 16, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 wide images (in that\n     order) and converts them to icons. Doesn't do any scaling, doesn't\n     generate mini (12x12) icons.  If no 32x32 image was found, and the\n     -noLarge flag was not passed, one is generated by scaling the image.\n\n     If no output file is specified, output is written to a file whose name is\n     the input file name, with the original extension replaced by '.icns'.\n\nOPTIONS\n     -noLarge  tiff2icns always creates a large 32x32 icon unless the -noLarge\n\t       flag is passed.\n\nmacOS\t\t\t\tAugust 28, 2002 \t\t\t macOS"
