By default, cupsfilter generates a PDF file. The\n       converted file is sent to the standard output.\n\nOPTIONS\n       --list-filters\n\t    Do not actually run the filters, just print the filters used to\n\t    stdout.\n\n       -D   Delete the input file after conversion.\n\n       -U user\n\t    Specifies the username passed to the filters. The default is the\n\t    name of the current user.\n\n       -c config-file\n\t    Uses the named cups-files.conf configuration file."
