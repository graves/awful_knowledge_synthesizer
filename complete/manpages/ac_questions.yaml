The tty\n\t\tspecification can start with '!' to indicate not this tty and\n\t\tend with '*' to indicate all similarly named ttys.  Multiple\n\t\t-t flags may be specified.\n\n     -w wtmp\tRead connect time data from wtmp instead of the default,\n\t\treading from the log(1).\n\n     users ...\tDisplay totals for the given individuals only.\n\n     If no arguments are given, ac displays the total connect time for all\n     accounts with login sessions recorded in log(1)."
