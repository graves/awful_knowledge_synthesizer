CRLs, which are optionally used as part of the procedure\n       for verifying X.509 certificates, are typically fetched from the\n       network using a URL which appears in (some) certificates. Caching CRLs\n       is an optimization to avoid costs of network latency and/or\n       unavailability. Each CRL has a finite validity time which is specified\n       in the CRL itself. This validity time may be as short as one day, or it\n       may be much longer. Crlrefresh examines the contents of the CRL cache\n       and updates - via network fetch - all CRLs which are currently, or will\n       soon be, invalid.  Crlrefresh is also use to fetch specific CRLs and\n       certificates from the network; CRLs fetched via crlrefresh will be\n       added to the CRL cache as well as provided to the specified output file\n       (or to stdout if no output file is provided). The URL specified in the\n       f and F commands must have schema \"http:\" or \"ldap:\".  Typically,\n       crlrefresh would be run on a regular basis via one of the configuration\n       files used by the cron(8) program."

The default\n\t      is 10 days.\n\n       o=expire_overlap\n\t      Specify the time in seconds prior to a CRL's expiration when a\n\t      refresh action will attempt to replace the CRL with a fresh\n\t      copy.\n\n       p      Purge all entries from the CRL cache, ensuring refresh with\n\t      fresh CRLs. Normally, CRLs whose expiration date is more than\n\t      expire_overlap past the current time are not refreshed.\n\n       f      Perform full cryptographic verification of all CRLs in the CRL\n\t      cache. Normally this step is only performed when a CRL is\n\t      actually used to validate a certificate.\n\n       k=keychain_name\n\t      The full path to the CRL cache (which is always a keychain). The\n\t      default is /var/db/crls/crlcache.db.\n\n       v      Provide verbose output during operation.\n\n       F=output_file_name\n\t      When fetching a CRL or certificate, specifies the destination to\n\t      which the fetched entity will be written. If this is not\n\t      specified then the fetched entity is sent to stdout."
