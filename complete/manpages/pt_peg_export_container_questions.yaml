Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This package implements the parsing expression grammar export plugin\n       for the generation of CONTAINER markup.\n\n       It resides in the Export section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools and\n       is intended to be used by pt::peg::export, the export manager, sitting\n       between it and the corresponding core conversion functionality provided\n       by pt::peg::to::container.\n\n       IMAGE: arch_core_eplugins\n\n       While the direct use of this package with a regular interpreter is\n       possible, this is strongly disrecommended and requires a number of\n       contortions to provide the expected environment.  The proper way to use\n       this functionality depends on the situation:\n\n       [1]    In an untrusted environment the proper access is through the\n\t      package pt::peg::export and the export manager objects it\n\t      provides.\n\n       [2]    In a trusted environment however simply use the package\n\t      pt::peg::to::container and access the core conversion\n\t      functionality directly.\n\nAPI\n       The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the\n       Plugin API found in the Parser Tools Export API specification.\n\n       export serial configuration\n\t      This command takes the canonical serialization of a parsing\n\t      expression grammar, as specified in section PEG serialization\n\t      format, and contained in serial, the configuration, a\n\t      dictionary, and generates CONTAINER markup encoding the grammar.\n\t      The created string is then returned as the result of the\n\t      command.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       The CONTAINER export plugin recognizes the following configuration\n       variables and changes its behaviour as they specify.\n\n       enum mode\n\t      The value of this configuration variable controls which methods\n\t      of pt::peg instances the plugin will use to specify the grammar.\n\t      There are two legal values\n\n\t      bulk   In this mode the methods start, add, modes, and rules are\n\t\t     used to specify the grammar in a bulk manner, i.e. as a\n\t\t     set of nonterminal symbols, and two dictionaries mapping\n\t\t     from the symbols to their semantic modes and parsing\n\t\t     expressions.\n\n\t\t     This mode is the default.\n\n\t      incremental\n\t\t     In this mode the methods start, add, mode, and rule are\n\t\t     used to specify the grammar piecemal, with each\n\t\t     nonterminal having its own block of defining commands.\n\n       string template\n\t      If this configuration variable is set it is assumed to contain a\n\t      string into which to put the generated code and other\n\t      configuration data. The various locations are expected to be\n\t      specified with the following placeholders:\n\n\t      @user@ To be replaced with the value of the configuration\n\t\t     variable user.\n\n\t      @format@\n\t\t     To be replaced with the the constant CONTAINER.\n\n\t      @file@ To be replaced with the value of the configuration\n\t\t     variable file.\n\n\t      @name@ To be replaced with the value of the configuration\n\t\t     variable name.\n\n\t      @mode@ To be replaced with the value of the configuration\n\t\t     variable mode.\n\n\t      @code@ To be replaced with the generated code.\n\n       If this configuration variable is not set, or empty, then the plugin\n       falls back to a standard template, which is defined as \"@code@\".\n\n       Note that this plugin may ignore the standard configuration variables\n       user, format, file, and their values, depending on the chosen template.\n\n       The content of the standard configuration variable name, if set, is\n       used as name of the grammar in the output. Otherwise the plugin falls\n       back to the default name a_pe_grammar.\n\nGRAMMAR CONTAINER\n       The container format is another form of describing parsing expression\n       grammars. While data in this format is executable it does not\n       constitute a parser for the grammar. It always has to be used in\n       conjunction with the package pt::peg::interp, a grammar interpreter.\n\n       The format represents grammars by a snit::type, i.e. class, whose\n       instances are API-compatible to the instances of the pt::peg::container\n       package, and which are preloaded with the grammar in question.\n\n       It has no direct formal specification beyond what was said above.\n\n   EXAMPLE\n       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions"
