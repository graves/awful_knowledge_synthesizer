    Manpage text:

    -P
           Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities
           overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a
           window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see
           command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the
           memory containing the command-line arguments.

         -r
           Display replication statistics, as described in DB_ENV->rep_stat.

         -s
           Display statistics for the specified database contained in the file
           specified with the -d flag.

         -t
           Display transaction region statistics, as described in
           DB_ENV->txn_stat.

         -V
           Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

         -Z
           Reset the statistics after reporting them; valid only with the -c, -e,
           -l, -m, and -t options.

         Values normally displayed in quantities of bytes are displayed as a
         combination of gigabytes (GB), megabytes (MB), kilobytes (KB), and bytes
         (B). Otherwise, values smaller than 10 million are displayed without any
         special notation, and values larger than 10 million are displayed as a
         number followed by "M".
