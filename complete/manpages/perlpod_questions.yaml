Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlpod`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPERLPOD(1)\t       Perl Programmers Reference Guide \t    PERLPOD(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       perlpod - the Plain Old Documentation format\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Pod is a simple-to-use markup language used for writing documentation\n       for Perl, Perl programs, and Perl modules.\n\n       Translators are available for converting Pod to various formats like\n       plain text, HTML, man pages, and more.\n\n       Pod markup consists of three basic kinds of paragraphs: ordinary,\n       verbatim, and command.\n\n   Ordinary Paragraph\n       Most paragraphs in your documentation will be ordinary blocks of text,\n       like this one.  You can simply type in your text without any markup\n       whatsoever, and with just a blank line before and after.  When it gets\n       formatted, it will undergo minimal formatting, like being rewrapped,\n       probably put into a proportionally spaced font, and maybe even\n       justified.\n\n       You can use formatting codes in ordinary paragraphs, for bold, italic,\n       \"code-style\", hyperlinks, and more.  Such codes are explained in the\n       \"Formatting Codes\" section, below.\n\n   Verbatim Paragraph\n       Verbatim paragraphs are usually used for presenting a codeblock or\n       other text which does not require any special parsing or formatting,\n       and which shouldn't be wrapped.\n\n       A verbatim paragraph is distinguished by having its first character be\n       a space or a tab.  (And commonly, all its lines begin with spaces\n       and/or tabs.)  It should be reproduced exactly, with tabs assumed to be\n       on 8-column boundaries.\tThere are no special formatting codes, so you\n       can't italicize or anything like that.  A \\ means \\, and nothing else.\n\n   Command Paragraph\n       A command paragraph is used for special treatment of whole chunks of\n       text, usually as headings or parts of lists.\n\n       All command paragraphs (which are typically only one line long) start\n       with \"=\", followed by an identifier, followed by arbitrary text that\n       the command can use however it pleases.\tCurrently recognized commands\n       are\n\n\t   =pod\n\t   =head1 Heading Text\n\t   =head2 Heading Text\n\t   =head3 Heading Text\n\t   =head4 Heading Text\n\t   =over indentlevel\n\t   =item stuff\n\t   =back\n\t   =begin format\n\t   =end format\n\t   =for format text...\n\t   =encoding type\n\t   =cut\n\n       To explain them each in detail:\n\n       \"=head1 Heading Text\"\n       \"=head2 Heading Text\"\n       \"=head3 Heading Text\"\n       \"=head4 Heading Text\"\n\t   Head1 through head4 produce headings, head1 being the highest\n\t   level.  The text in the rest of this paragraph is the content of\n\t   the heading.  For example:\n\n\t     =head2 Object Attributes\n\n\t   The text \"Object Attributes\" comprises the heading there.  The text\n\t   in these heading commands can use formatting codes, as seen here:\n\n\t     =head2 Possible Values for C<$/>\n\n\t   Such commands are explained in the \"Formatting Codes\" section,\n\t   below.\n\n       \"=over indentlevel\"\n       \"=item stuff...\"\n       \"=back\"\n\t   Item, over, and back require a little more explanation:  \"=over\"\n\t   starts a region specifically for the generation of a list using\n\t   \"=item\" commands, or for indenting (groups of) normal paragraphs.\n\t   At the end of your list, use \"=back\" to end it.  The indentlevel\n\t   option to \"=over\" indicates how far over to indent, generally in\n\t   ems (where one em is the width of an \"M\" in the document's base\n\t   font) or roughly comparable units; if there is no indentlevel\n\t   option, it defaults to four.  (And some formatters may just ignore\n\t   whatever indentlevel you provide.)  In the stuff in \"=item\n\t   stuff...\", you may use formatting codes, as seen here:\n\n\t     =item Using C<$|> to Control Buffering\n\n\t   Such commands are explained in the \"Formatting Codes\" section,\n\t   below.\n\n\t   Note also that there are some basic rules to using \"=over\" ...\n\t   \"=back\" regions:\n\n\t   •   Don't use \"=item\"s outside of an \"=over\" ... \"=back\" region.\n\n\t   •   The first thing after the \"=over\" command should be an \"=item\",\n\t       unless there aren't going to be any items at all in this\n\t       \"=over\" ... \"=back\" region.\n\n\t   •   Don't put \"=headn\" commands inside an \"=over\" ... \"=back\"\n\t       region.\n\n\t   •   And perhaps most importantly, keep the items consistent: either\n\t       use \"=item *\" for all of them, to produce bullets; or use\n\t       \"=item 1.\", \"=item 2.\", etc., to produce numbered lists; or use\n\t       \"=item foo\", \"=item bar\", etc.--namely, things that look\n\t       nothing like bullets or numbers.  (If you have a list that\n\t       contains both: 1) things that don't look like bullets nor\n\t       numbers,  plus 2) things that do, you should preface the\n\t       bullet- or number-like items with \"Z<>\".  See Z<> below for an\n\t       example.)\n\n\t       If you start with bullets or numbers, stick with them, as\n\t       formatters use the first \"=item\" type to decide how to format\n\t       the list.\n\n       \"=cut\"\n\t   To end a Pod block, use a blank line, then a line beginning with\n\t   \"=cut\", and a blank line after it.  This lets Perl (and the Pod\n\t   formatter) know that this is where Perl code is resuming.  (The\n\t   blank line before the \"=cut\" is not technically necessary, but many\n\t   older Pod processors require it.)\n\n       \"=pod\"\n\t   The \"=pod\" command by itself doesn't do much of anything, but it\n\t   signals to Perl (and Pod formatters) that a Pod block starts here.\n\t   A Pod block starts with any command paragraph, so a \"=pod\" command\n\t   is usually used just when you want to start a Pod block with an\n\t   ordinary paragraph or a verbatim paragraph.\tFor example:\n\n\t     =item stuff()\n\n\t     This function does stuff.\n\n\t     =cut\n\n\t     sub stuff {\n\t       ...\n\t     }\n\n\t     =pod\n\n\t     Remember to check its return value, as in:\n\n\t       stuff() || die \"Couldn't do stuff!\";\n\n\t     =cut\n\n       \"=begin formatname\"\n       \"=end formatname\"\n       \"=for formatname text...\"\n\t   For, begin, and end will let you have regions of text/code/data\n\t   that are not generally interpreted as normal Pod text, but are\n\t   passed directly to particular formatters, or are otherwise special.\n\t   A formatter that can use that format will use the region, otherwise\n\t   it will be completely ignored.\n\n\t   A command \"=begin formatname\", some paragraphs, and a command \"=end\n\t   formatname\", mean that the text/data in between is meant for\n\t   formatters that understand the special format called formatname.\n\t   For example,\n\n\t     =begin html\n\n\t     <hr> <img src=\"thang.png\">\n\t     <p> This is a raw HTML paragraph </p>\n\n\t     =end html\n\n\t   The command \"=for formatname text...\" specifies that the remainder\n\t   of just this paragraph (starting right after formatname) is in that\n\t   special format.\n\n\t     =for html <hr> <img src=\"thang.png\">\n\t     <p> This is a raw HTML paragraph </p>\n\n\t   This means the same thing as the above \"=begin html\" ... \"=end\n\t   html\" region.\n\n\t   That is, with \"=for\", you can have only one paragraph's worth of\n\t   text (i.e., the text in \"=foo targetname text...\"), but with\n\t   \"=begin targetname\" ... \"=end targetname\", you can have any amount\n\t   of stuff in between.  (Note that there still must be a blank line\n\t   after the \"=begin\" command and a blank line before the \"=end\"\n\t   command.)\n\n\t   Here are some examples of how to use these:\n\n\t     =begin html\n\n\t     <br>Figure 1.<br><IMG SRC=\"figure1.png\"><br>\n\n\t     =end html\n\n\t     =begin text\n\n\t       ---------------\n\t       |  foo\t     |\n\t       |\tbar  |\n\t       ---------------\n\n\t     ^^^^ Figure 1. ^^^^\n\n\t     =end text\n\n\t   Some format names that formatters currently are known to accept\n\t   include \"roff\", \"man\", \"latex\", \"tex\", \"text\", and \"html\".  (Some\n\t   formatters will treat some of these as synonyms.)\n\n\t   A format name of \"comment\" is common for just making notes\n\t   (presumably to yourself) that won't appear in any formatted version\n\t   of the Pod document:\n\n\t     =for comment\n\t     Make sure that all the available options are documented!\n\n\t   Some formatnames will require a leading colon (as in \"=for\n\t   :formatname\", or \"=begin :formatname\" ... \"=end :formatname\"), to\n\t   signal that the text is not raw data, but instead is Pod text\n\t   (i.e., possibly containing formatting codes) that's just not for\n\t   normal formatting (e.g., may not be a normal-use paragraph, but\n\t   might be for formatting as a footnote).\n\n       \"=encoding encodingname\"\n\t   This command is used for declaring the encoding of a document.\n\t   Most users won't need this; but if your encoding isn't US-ASCII,\n\t   then put a \"=encoding encodingname\" command very early in the\n\t   document so that pod formatters will know how to decode the\n\t   document.  For encodingname, use a name recognized by the\n\t   Encode::Supported module.  Some pod formatters may try to guess\n\t   between a Latin-1 or CP-1252 versus UTF-8 encoding, but they may\n\t   guess wrong.  It's best to be explicit if you use anything besides\n\t   strict ASCII.  Examples:\n\n\t     =encoding latin1\n\n\t     =encoding utf8\n\n\t     =encoding koi8-r\n\n\t     =encoding ShiftJIS\n\n\t     =encoding big5\n\n\t   \"=encoding\" affects the whole document, and must occur only once.\n\n       And don't forget, all commands but \"=encoding\" last up until the end of\n       its paragraph, not its line.  So in the examples below, you can see\n       that every command needs the blank line after it, to end its paragraph.\n       (And some older Pod translators may require the \"=encoding\" line to\n       have a following blank line as well, even though it should be legal to\n       omit.)\n\n       Some examples of lists include:\n\n\t =over\n\n\t =item *\n\n\t First item\n\n\t =item *\n\n\t Second item\n\n\t =back\n\n\t =over\n\n\t =item Foo()\n\n\t Description of Foo function\n\n\t =item Bar()\n\n\t Description of Bar function\n\n\t =back\n\n   Formatting Codes\n       In ordinary paragraphs and in some command paragraphs, various\n       formatting codes (a.k.a. \"interior sequences\") can be used:\n\n       \"I<text>\" -- italic text\n\t   Used for emphasis (\"\"be I<careful!>\"\") and parameters (\"\"redo\n\t   I<LABEL>\"\")\n\n       \"B<text>\" -- bold text\n\t   Used for switches (\"\"perl's B<-n> switch\"\"), programs (\"\"some\n\t   systems provide a B<chfn> for that\"\"), emphasis (\"\"be\n\t   B<careful!>\"\"), and so on (\"\"and that feature is known as\n\t   B<autovivification>\"\").\n\n       \"C<code>\" -- code text\n\t   Renders code in a typewriter font, or gives some other indication\n\t   that this represents program text (\"\"C<gmtime($^T)>\"\") or some\n\t   other form of computerese (\"\"C<drwxr-xr-x>\"\").\n\n       \"L<name>\" -- a hyperlink\n\t   There are various syntaxes, listed below.  In the syntaxes given,\n\t   \"text\", \"name\", and \"section\" cannot contain the characters '/' and\n\t   '|'; and any '<' or '>' should be matched.\n\n\t   •   \"L<name>\"\n\n\t       Link to a Perl manual page (e.g., \"L<Net::Ping>\").  Note that\n\t       \"name\" should not contain spaces.  This syntax is also\n\t       occasionally used for references to Unix man pages, as in\n\t       \"L<crontab(5)>\".\n\n\t   •   \"L<name/\"sec\">\" or \"L<name/sec>\"\n\n\t       Link to a section in other manual page.\tE.g., \"L<perlsyn/\"For\n\t       Loops\">\"\n\n\t   •   \"L</\"sec\">\" or \"L</sec>\"\n\n\t       Link to a section in this manual page.  E.g., \"L</\"Object\n\t       Methods\">\"\n\n\t   A section is started by the named heading or item.  For example,\n\t   \"L<perlvar/$.>\" or \"L<perlvar/\"$.\">\" both link to the section\n\t   started by \"\"=item $.\"\" in perlvar.\tAnd \"L<perlsyn/For Loops>\" or\n\t   \"L<perlsyn/\"For Loops\">\" both link to the section started by\n\t   \"\"=head2 For Loops\"\" in perlsyn.\n\n\t   To control what text is used for display, you use \"\"L<text|...>\"\",\n\t   as in:\n\n\t   •   \"L<text|name>\"\n\n\t       Link this text to that manual page.  E.g., \"L<Perl Error\n\t       Messages|perldiag>\"\n\n\t   •   \"L<text|name/\"sec\">\" or \"L<text|name/sec>\"\n\n\t       Link this text to that section in that manual page.  E.g.,\n\t       \"L<postfix \"if\"|perlsyn/\"Statement Modifiers\">\"\n\n\t   •   \"L<text|/\"sec\">\" or \"L<text|/sec>\" or \"L<text|\"sec\">\"\n\n\t       Link this text to that section in this manual page.  E.g.,\n\t       \"L<the various attributes|/\"Member Data\">\"\n\n\t   Or you can link to a web page:\n\n\t   •   \"L<scheme:...>\"\n\n\t       \"L<text|scheme:...>\"\n\n\t       Links to an absolute URL.  For example,\n\t       \"L<http://www.perl.org/>\" or \"L<The Perl Home\n\t       Page|http://www.perl.org/>\".\n\n       \"E<escape>\" -- a character escape\n\t   Very similar to HTML/XML \"&foo;\" \"entity references\":\n\n\t   •   \"E<lt>\" -- a literal < (less than)\n\n\t   •   \"E<gt>\" -- a literal > (greater than)\n\n\t   •   \"E<verbar>\" -- a literal | (vertical bar)\n\n\t   •   \"E<sol>\" -- a literal / (solidus)\n\n\t       The above four are optional except in other formatting codes,\n\t       notably \"L<...>\", and when preceded by a capital letter.\n\n\t   •   \"E<htmlname>\"\n\n\t       Some non-numeric HTML entity name, such as \"E<eacute>\", meaning\n\t       the same thing as \"&eacute;\" in HTML -- i.e., a lowercase e\n\t       with an acute (/-shaped) accent.\n\n\t   •   \"E<number>\"\n\n\t       The ASCII/Latin-1/Unicode character with that number.  A\n\t       leading \"0x\" means that number is hex, as in \"E<0x201E>\".  A\n\t       leading \"0\" means that number is octal, as in \"E<075>\".\n\t       Otherwise number is interpreted as being in decimal, as in\n\t       \"E<181>\".\n\n\t       Note that older Pod formatters might not recognize octal or hex\n\t       numeric escapes, and that many formatters cannot reliably\n\t       render characters above 255.  (Some formatters may even have to\n\t       use compromised renderings of Latin-1/CP-1252 characters, like\n\t       rendering \"E<eacute>\" as just a plain \"e\".)\n\n       \"F<filename>\" -- used for filenames\n\t   Typically displayed in italics.  Example: \"\"F<.cshrc>\"\"\n\n       \"S<text>\" -- text contains non-breaking spaces\n\t   This means that the words in text should not be broken across\n\t   lines.  Example: \"S<$x ? $y : $z>\".\n\n       \"X<topic name>\" -- an index entry\n\t   This is ignored by most formatters, but some may use it for\n\t   building indexes.  It always renders as empty-string.  Example:\n\t   \"X<absolutizing relative URLs>\"\n\n       \"Z<>\" -- a null (zero-effect) formatting code\n\t   This is rarely used.  It's one way to get around using an E<...>\n\t   code sometimes.  For example, instead of \"\"NE<lt>3\"\" (for \"N<3\")\n\t   you could write \"\"NZ<><3\"\" (the \"Z<>\" breaks up the \"N\" and the \"<\"\n\t   so they can't be considered the part of a (fictitious) \"N<...>\"\n\t   code).\n\n\t   Another use is to indicate that stuff in \"=item Z<>stuff...\" is not\n\t   to be considered to be a bullet or number.  For example, without\n\t   the \"Z<>\", the line\n\n\t    =item Z<>500 Server error\n\n\t   could possibly be parsed as an item in a numbered list when it\n\t   isn't meant to be.\n\n\t   Still another use is to maintain visual space between \"=item\"\n\t   lines.  If you specify\n\n\t    =item foo\n\n\t    =item bar\n\n\t   it will typically get rendered as\n\n\t    foo\n\t    bar\n\n\t   That may be what you want, but if what you really want is\n\n\t    foo\n\n\t    bar\n\n\t   you can use \"Z<>\" to accomplish that\n\n\t    =item foo\n\n\t    Z<>\n\n\t    =item bar\n\n       Most of the time, you will need only a single set of angle brackets to\n       delimit the beginning and end of formatting codes.  However, sometimes\n       you will want to put a real right angle bracket (a greater-than sign,\n       '>') inside of a formatting code.  This is particularly common when\n       using a formatting code to provide a different font-type for a snippet\n       of code.  As with all things in Perl, there is more than one way to do\n       it.  One way is to simply escape the closing bracket using an \"E\" code:\n\n\t   C<$a E<lt>=E<gt> $b>\n\n       This will produce: \"\"$a <=> $b\"\"\n\n       A more readable, and perhaps more \"plain\" way is to use an alternate\n       set of delimiters that doesn't require a single \">\" to be escaped.\n       Doubled angle brackets (\"<<\" and \">>\") may be used if and only if there\n       is whitespace right after the opening delimiter and whitespace right\n       before the closing delimiter!  For example, the following will do the\n       trick:\n\n\t   C<< $a <=> $b >>\n\n       In fact, you can use as many repeated angle-brackets as you like so\n       long as you have the same number of them in the opening and closing\n       delimiters, and make sure that whitespace immediately follows the last\n       '<' of the opening delimiter, and immediately precedes the first '>' of\n       the closing delimiter.  (The whitespace is ignored.)  So the following\n       will also work:\n\n\t   C<<< $a <=> $b >>>\n\t   C<<<<  $a <=> $b\t>>>>\n\n       And they all mean exactly the same as this:\n\n\t   C<$a E<lt>=E<gt> $b>\n\n       The multiple-bracket form does not affect the interpretation of the\n       contents of the formatting code, only how it must end.  That means that\n       the examples above are also exactly the same as this:\n\n\t   C<< $a E<lt>=E<gt> $b >>\n\n       As a further example, this means that if you wanted to put these bits\n       of code in \"C\" (code) style:\n\n\t   open(X, \">>thing.dat\") || die $!\n\t   $foo->bar();\n\n       you could do it like so:\n\n\t   C<<< open(X, \">>thing.dat\") || die $! >>>\n\t   C<< $foo->bar(); >>\n\n       which is presumably easier to read than the old way:\n\n\t   C<open(X, \"E<gt>E<gt>thing.dat\") || die $!>\n\t   C<$foo-E<gt>bar();>\n\n       This is currently supported by pod2text (Pod::Text), pod2man\n       (Pod::Man), and any other pod2xxx or Pod::Xxxx translators that use\n       Pod::Parser 1.093 or later, or Pod::Tree 1.02 or later.\n\n   The Intent\n       The intent is simplicity of use, not power of expression.  Paragraphs\n       look like paragraphs (block format), so that they stand out visually,\n       and so that I could run them through \"fmt\" easily to reformat them\n       (that's F7 in my version of vi, or Esc Q in my version of emacs).  I\n       wanted the translator to always leave the \"'\" and \"`\" and \"\"\" quotes\n       alone, in verbatim mode, so I could slurp in a working program, shift\n       it over four spaces, and have it print out, er, verbatim.  And\n       presumably in a monospace font.\n\n       The Pod format is not necessarily sufficient for writing a book.  Pod\n       is just meant to be an idiot-proof common source for nroff, HTML, TeX,\n       and other markup languages, as used for online documentation.\n       Translators exist for pod2text, pod2html, pod2man (that's for nroff(1)\n       and troff(1)), pod2latex, and pod2fm.  Various others are available in\n       CPAN.\n\n   Embedding Pods in Perl Modules\n       You can embed Pod documentation in your Perl modules and scripts.\n       Start your documentation with an empty line, a \"=head1\" command at the\n       beginning, and end it with a \"=cut\" command and an empty line.  The\n       perl executable will ignore the Pod text.  You can place a Pod\n       statement where perl expects the beginning of a new statement, but not\n       within a statement, as that would result in an error.  See any of the\n       supplied library modules for examples.\n\n       If you're going to put your Pod at the end of the file, and you're\n       using an \"__END__\" or \"__DATA__\" cut mark, make sure to put an empty\n       line there before the first Pod command.\n\n\t __END__\n\n\t =head1 NAME\n\n\t Time::Local - efficiently compute time from local and GMT time\n\n       Without that empty line before the \"=head1\", many translators wouldn't\n       have recognized the \"=head1\" as starting a Pod block.\n\n   Hints for Writing Pod\n       •"

If you have an apparently empty line with some spaces\n\t   on it, this might not count as a separator for those translators,\n\t   and that could cause odd formatting.\n\n       •   Older translators might add wording around an L<> link, so that\n\t   \"L<Foo::Bar>\" may become \"the Foo::Bar manpage\", for example.  So\n\t   you shouldn't write things like \"the L<foo> documentation\", if you\n\t   want the translated document to read sensibly.  Instead, write \"the\n\t   L<Foo::Bar|Foo::Bar> documentation\" or \"L<the Foo::Bar\n\t   documentation|Foo::Bar>\", to control how the link comes out."
