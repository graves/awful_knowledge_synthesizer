Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `postlock`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPOSTLOCK(1)\t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t   POSTLOCK(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       postlock - lock mail folder and execute command\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       postlock [-c config_dir] [-l lock_style]\n\t       [-v] file command...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The postlock(1) command locks file for exclusive access, and executes\n       command. The locking method is compatible with the Postfix UNIX-style\n       local delivery agent.\n\n       Options:\n\n       -c config_dir\n\t      Read the main.cf configuration file in the named directory\n\t      instead of the default configuration directory.\n\n       -l lock_style\n\t      Override the locking method specified via the\n\t      mailbox_delivery_lock configuration parameter (see below).\n\n       -v     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple -v\n\t      options make the software increasingly verbose.\n\n       Arguments:\n\n       file   A mailbox file. The user should have read/write permission.\n\n       command...\n\t      The command to execute while file is locked for exclusive\n\t      access.  The command is executed directly, i.e. without\n\t      interpretation by a shell command interpreter.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       The result status is 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL) when postlock(1) could not\n       perform the requested operation.  Otherwise, the exit status is the\n       exit status from the command.\n\nBUGS\n       With remote file systems, the ability to acquire a lock does not\n       necessarily eliminate access conflicts. Avoid file access by processes\n       running on different machines.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\n       MAIL_CONFIG\n\t      Directory with Postfix configuration files.\n\n       MAIL_VERBOSE\n\t      Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       The following main.cf parameters are especially relevant to this\n       program.  The text below provides only a parameter summary. See\n       postconf(5) for more details including examples.\n\nLOCKING CONTROLS\n\n       deliver_lock_attempts (20)\n\t      The maximal number of attempts to acquire an exclusive lock on a\n\t      mailbox file or bounce(8) logfile.\n\n       deliver_lock_delay (1s)\n\t      The time between attempts to acquire an exclusive lock on a\n\t      mailbox file or bounce(8) logfile.\n\n       stale_lock_time (500s)\n\t      The time after which a stale exclusive mailbox lockfile is\n\t      removed.\n\n       mailbox_delivery_lock (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      How to lock a UNIX-style local(8) mailbox before attempting\n\t      delivery.\n\nRESOURCE AND RATE CONTROLS\n\n       fork_attempts (5)\n\t      The maximal number of attempts to fork() a child process.\n\n       fork_delay (1s)\n\t      The delay between attempts to fork() a child process.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS CONTROLS\n\n       config_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf\n\t      configuration files.\n\n       import_environment (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      The list of environment parameters that a privileged Postfix\n\t      process will import from a non-Postfix parent process, or\n\t      name=value environment overrides.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       postconf(5), configuration parameters\n\nLICENSE\n       The Secure Mailer license must be distributed with this software.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n       Wietse Venema\n       IBM T.J.
