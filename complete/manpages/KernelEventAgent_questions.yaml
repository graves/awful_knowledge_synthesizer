It is not intended to be run\n     directly, but rather started by the system.  The few options it has are\n     intended as debugging aids.  Typically, allowing the system to start\n     KernelEventAgent by itself, without any additional options, is the ideal\n     configuration.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -d    Debug mode.\tDo not fork into a detached process, and write\n\t   messages to stderr as well as the system log.\n\n     -v    Verbose mode.  System messages of LOG_INFO level and LOG_DEBUG\n\t   level are raised to the LOG_NOTICE level.\n\n     -f fsname\n\t   The file system identified by fsname is also passed the timeout\n\t   value via the VFS_CTL_TIMEO sysctl."

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use KernelEventAgent in debug mode to monitor a file system named 'myfs' with a timeout of 30 seconds?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using KernelEventAgent in verbose mode to ensure system messages are logged at a higher priority level?
