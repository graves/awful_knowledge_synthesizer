If a window “.” is deleted then all windows\n       will be destroyed and the application will (normally) exit.  The\n       windows are destroyed in order, and if an error occurs in destroying a\n       window the command aborts without destroying the remaining windows.  No\n       error is returned if window does not exist.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       Destroy all checkbuttons that are direct children of the given widget:\n\t      proc killCheckbuttonChildren {parent} {\n\t\t foreach w [winfo children $parent] {\n\t\t    if {[winfo class $w] eq \"Checkbutton\"} {\n\t\t       destroy $w\n\t\t    }\n\t\t }\n\t      }"
