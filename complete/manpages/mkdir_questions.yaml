The mode argument can be\n\t\t    in any of the formats specified to the chmod(1) command.\n\t\t    If a symbolic mode is specified, the operation characters\n\t\t    ‘+’ and ‘-’ are interpreted relative to an initial mode of\n\t\t    “a=rwx”.\n\n     -p \t    Create intermediate directories as required.  If this\n\t\t    option is not specified, the full path prefix of each\n\t\t    operand must already exist.  On the other hand, with this\n\t\t    option specified, no error will be reported if a directory\n\t\t    given as an operand already exists.  Intermediate\n\t\t    directories are created with permission bits of\n\t\t    “rwxrwxrwx” (0777) as modified by the current umask, plus\n\t\t    write and search permission for the owner."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the mkdir command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use mkdir to create a directory named 'data' with specific permissions (e.g., 755) and ensure that any necessary parent directories are created?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using mkdir with the -p option to create a directory structure like 'projects/docs/reports'?
