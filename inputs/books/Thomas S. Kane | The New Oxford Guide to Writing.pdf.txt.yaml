    The New Oxford Guide to Writing  
    Introduction  
    
    Two broad assumptions underlie this book: (1) that writing is a rational activity, and (2) that it is a valuable activity.  
    
    To say that writing is rational means nothing more than that it is an exercise of mind requiring the mastery of techniques anyone can learn. Obviously, there are limits: one cannot learn to write like Shakespeare or Charles Dickens. You can't become a genius by reading a book.  
    
    But you don't have to be a genius to write clear, effective English. You just have to understand what writing involves and to know how to handle words and sentences and paragraphs. That you can learn. If you do, you can communicate what you want to communicate in words other people can understand. This book will help by showing you what good writers do.  
    
    The second assumption is that writing is worth learning. It is of immediate practical benefit in any job or career. Certainly there are many jobs in which you can get along without being able to write clearly. If you know how to write, however, you will get along faster and farther.  
    
    There is another, more profound value to writing. We create ourselves by words. Before we are businesspeople or lawyers or engineers or teachers, we are human beings. Our
  - |-
    Growth as human beings depends on our capacity to under-
    stand and to use language. Writing is a way of growing. No
    one would argue that being able to write will make you mor-
    ally better. But it will make you more complex and more
    
    lateresdingremm human.
    
    CHAPTER
    
    Subject, Reader,
    and Kinds of Writing
    
    Choosing a Subject
    
    Often, of course, you are not free to choose at all. You must
    compose a report for a business meeting or write on an as-
    signed topic for an English class. The problem then becomes
    not what to write about but how to attack it, a question we'll
    discuss in Chapters 5 and 6.
    
    When you can select a subject for yourself, it ought to in-
    terest you, and interest others as well, at least potentially. It
    should be within the range of your experience and skill,
    though it is best if it stretches you. It ought to be neither so
    vast that no one person can encompass it nor so narrow and
    trivial that no one cares.
    
    Don't be afraid to express your own opinions and feelings.
    You are a vital part of the subject. No matter what the topic,
    you are really writing about how you understand it, how you
    feel about it. Good writing has personality. Readers enjoy
    sensing a mind at work, hearing a clear voice, responding to
    an unusual sensibility. If you have chosen a topic that is of
    general concern, and if genuine feeling and intelligence come
    through, you will be interesting. Interest lies not so much in
    a topic as in what a writer has made of it.
    
    6 INTRODUCTION
    
    About Readers
    
    You don't want to repel readers. This doesn't mean you have
    to flatter them or avoid saying something they may disagree
    with. It does mean you must respect them. Don't take their
    interest for granted or suppose that it is the readers' job to
    follow you. It's your job to guide them, to make their task as
    easy as the subject allows.
  - |-
    Ask yourself questions about your readers: What can I expect them to know and not know? What do they believe and value? How do I want to affect them by what I say? What attitudes and claims will meet with their approval? What will offend them? What objections may they have to my ideas, and how can I anticipate and counter those objections?
    
    Readers may be annoyed if you overestimate their knowledge. Tossing off unusual words may seem a put-down, a way of saying, "I know more than you." On the other hand, laboring the obvious also implies a low opinion of readers: don't tell them what a wheel is; they know. It isn't easy to gauge your readers' knowledge or to sense their beliefs and values. Sensitivity to readers comes only with experience, and then imperfectly. Tact and respect, however, go a long way. Readers have egos too.
    
    Kinds of Writing
    
    The various effects a writer may wish to have on his or her readers—to persuade, to inform, to entertain—result in different kinds of prose. The most common is prose that informs, which, depending on what it is about, is called exposition, description, or narration.
    
    Exposition explains. How a combustion engine works. How the economy functions. Facts of everyday life, like why people get divorced. History—why Custer attacked at the Little Big Horn. Controversial issues laden with feelings and responsibility, whatever its subject, exposition reveals what a particular mind thinks or knows or believes. Exposition is constructed logically. It organizes around cause/effect, true/false, less/more, positive/negative, general/particular, assertion/denial. Its movement is signaled by connectives like therefore, however, and so, besides, but, not only, more important, in fact, for example.

    Description deals with perception. Its central problem is to arrange what we see into a picture-like the logic of exposition, the pattern is spatial: above/below, before/behind, right/left, and so on.
    
    The subject of narration is a series of related events—a story. Its problem is twofold: to arrange the events in a sequence of time and to reveal their significance.
    
    Persuasion seeks to alter how readers think or believe. It is usually about controversial topics and often appeals to reason in the form of argument, offering evidence or logical proof. Another form of persuasion is satire, which ridicules folly or evil, sometimes subtly, sometimes crudely and coarsely. Finally, persuasion may be in the form of eloquence, appealing to ideals and noble sentiments.
    
    Writing that is primarily entertaining includes fiction, personal essays, sketches. Such prose will receive less attention here. It is certainly important, but it is more remote from everyday needs than exposition or persuasion.
    
    For Practice
    
    > List ten or twelve topics you might develop into a short essay. Think of topics that deal not so much with things, places, or how-to-do projects as with your opinions and beliefs. Pick subjects that interest you and are within your experience, yet challenging. Be specific: don't simply write "my job" but something like "what I like most (or hate most) about my job."
    
    [> Selecting one of the topics on your list, compose a paragraph about the readers for whom you might develop it. Consider how
    you wish to affect those readers, what you want them to understand and feel. Think about their general knowledge, values, attitudes,
    biases; whether they are your age or older or younger, come from a similar or a different background; and how you would like them
    to regard you.

    CHAPTER
    
    Strategy and Style
    
    Purpose, the end you're aiming at, determines strategy and
    style. Strategy involves picking a topic to develop, deciding how to organize them, choosing this word rather than that, constructing various types of sentences, building paragraphs. Style is the result of strategy, the language that makes the strategy work.
  - |-
    The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.
    
    Think of purpose, strategy, and style in terms of increasing abstractness. Style is immediate and obvious. It exists in the writing itself; it is the sum of the actual words, sentences, paragraphs. Strategy is more abstract, felt beneath the words as the immediate ends they serve. Purpose is even deeper, supporting strategy and involving not only what you write about but how you affect readers.
    
    A brief example will clarify these overlapping concepts. It was written by a college student in a fifteen-minute exercise. The several topics from which the students could choose were stated beforehand—""treating,"' "ers," and so on—each writer had to think about restricting and organizing his or her composition. This student chose "marriage":
    
    Why get married? Or if you are modern, why live together? Answer:
    Insecurity. "Man needs woman; woman needs man." However, this
    cliché fails to explain need. How do you need someone of the
    opposite sex? Sexually is an insufficient explanation. Other animals
    do not stay with a mate for more than one season; some not even
    that long. Companionship, although a better answer, is also an in-
    complete explanation. We all have several friends. Why make one
    friend so significant that he at least partially excludes the others?
    Because we want to "join our lives." But this desire for joining is
    far from [semantic] We want someone to share our
    
    lives in order that we do not have to endure hardships alone.
    
    The writer's purpose is not so much to tell us of what she
    thinks about marriage as to convince us that what she thinks
    is true. Her purpose, then, is persuasive, and it leads to par-
    ticular strategies both of organization and of sentence style.
    Her organization is a formal question/answer strategy: a basic question ("Why get married?"); an
    initial, inadequate answer ("Insecurity"); a more precise ques-
    tion ("How do we need someone?"); a partial answer ("sex");
    then a second partial answer ("Companionship"); a final, more
    precise question ("Why make one friend so significant?");
    and a concluding answer ("so that we do not have to endure
    hardships alone").
  - |-
    The persuasive purpose is also reflected in the writer's strategy of short emphatic sentences. They are convincing, and they establish an appropriate informal relationship with readers.
    
    Finally, the student's purpose determines her strategy in approaching the subject and in presenting herself. About the topic, the writer avoids becoming pompous. As for herself, she adopts an impersonal point of view, avoiding such expressions as "I think" or "it seems to me." On another occasion they might suggest a pleasing modesty; here they would weaken the force of her argument.
    
    These strategies are effectively realized in the style: in the clear rhetorical questions, each immediately followed by a straightforward answer; and in the short uncomplicated sentences, echoing speech. (There are even two sentences that are grammatically insupportable—afic iBwer: "cause we want to Jornlives."") At the same time the sentences are sufficiently concise to achieve a strategy fundamental to all good presentation—the reader's attention.
    
    Remember several things about strategy. First, it is many-sided. Any piece of prose displays not one but numerous strategic elements, of sentence structure, of word choice, of point of view, of tone. In effective writing these reinforce one another.
    
    Second, no absolute one-to-one correspondence exists between strategy and purpose. A specific strategy may be adapted to various purposes. The question/answer mode of organizing, for example, is not confined to persuasion: it is often used in informative writing. Furthermore, a particular purpose may be served by different strategies. In our example the student's organization was not the only one possible. Another writer might have organized using a "list" strategy:
    
    People get married for a variety of reasons. First... Second... Third... Finally...
    
    Still another might have used a personal point of view, or taken a less serious approach, or assumed a more formal relationship with the reader.
    
    Style

    In its broadest sense "style" is the total of all the choices a
    writer makes concerning words and their arrangements. In
    this sense style may be good or Hathe-gloaides are
    appropriate to the writer's purpose, bad if they are not. More
    narrowly, "style" has a positive, approving sense, as when we
    say that someone has "style" or praise a writer for his or her
    "style." More narrowly yet, the word may also designate a
    particular way of writing, unique to a person or characteristic
    of a group or profession: "Hemingway's style," "an academic
    style."
    
    12 INTRODUCTION
    
    Here we use style to mean something between those ex-
    tremes. It will be a positive term, and while we speak of errors
    in style, we don't speak of "bad styles." On the other hand,
    we understand "style" to include many ways of writing, each
    appropriate for some purposes, less so for others. There is no
    one style, some ideal manner of writing at which all of us
    should aim. Style is flexible, capable of almost endless varia-
    tion. But one thing style is not: it is not a superficial fanciness
    brushed over the basic ideas. Rather than the gilding, style is
    the deep essence of writing.
    
    For Practice
    
    > Selecting one of the topics you listed at the end of Chapter 1,
    work up a paragraph of ft5Qvord20(efore you begin to
    
    write, think about possible strategies of organization and tone. Or-
    ganization involves (1) how you analyze your topic, the parts into
    which you divide it, and (2) the order in which you present these
    parts and how you tie them together. Tone means fidw you feel
    about your suyeet—abpjemive, and so on; (2) how
    
    you regard your eddenatior an informal relationship;
    
    and (3) how you present yourself.
    
    When you have the paragraph in its final shape, on a separate
    sheet of paper compose several sentences explaining what strate-
    gies you followed in organizing your paragraph and in aiming for
    a particular tone, and why you thought these would be appropriate.
    
    CHAPTER
    
    Grammar, Usage, and
    Mechanics
  - |-
    Purpose, strategy, and style are decided by you. But the decision must be made within limits set by rules over which you have little control. The rules fall into three groups: grammar, usage, and mechanics.
    
    Grammar
    
    Grammar means the rules which structure our language. The sentence "She dresses beautifully" is grammatical. These variations are not:
    
    Her dresses beautifully.
    Dresses beautifully she.
    
    The first rule that a pronoun must be in the subjective case when it is the subject of a verb. The second violates the conventional order of the English sentence: subject-verb-object. (That order is not invariable and may be altered, subject to other rules, but none of these permits the pattern: "Dresses beautifully she.")
    
    Grammatical rules are not the pronouncements of teachers, editors, or other authorities. They are simply the way people speak and write, and if enough people begin to speak and write, the rules change.
    
    Usage
    
    Usage designates rules of a less basic and binding sort, concerning how we should use the language in certain situations. These sentences, for instance, violate formal usage:
    
    She dresses beautiful.
    She ain't got no dress.
    
    Sentences like these are often heard in speech, but both break rules governing how educated people write. Formal usage dictates that when beautiful functions as an adverb it takes an -ed ending, that ain and a double negative like got n't or haven't got no should be avoided.
    
    Grammar and usage are often confused. Many people would argue that the sentences above are "ungrammatical." Our distinction, however, is more useful. Grammatical rules are implicit in the speech of all who use the language. Usage rules, on the other hand, stem from and change with social pressure. Ain't, for example, was once acceptable. The adverbial use of an adjective like beautiful was common in seventeenth-century prose. Chaucer and Shakespeare use double negatives for emphasis.
  - |-
    The fact that usage rules are less basic than grammatical ones, however, and even that they may seem arbitrary, does not lessen their force. Most of them contribute to clarity and economy of expression. Moreover, usage applies to all levels of purpose and strategy, to informal, colloquial styles as well as to formal ones. For example, grammatically incomplete sentences (or fragments), frowned upon in formal usage, are occasionally permissible and even valuable in informal composition. (Witness the two fragments in the student paragraph on marriage on page 8.) So is regarded in formal English as a subordinating conjunction which ought not to introduce a
    
    GRAMMAR, USAGE, AND MECHANICS 15
    
    sentence. But in a colloquial style, it may work better than a more literary connective like consequently or therefore.
    
    Mechanics
    
    In composition, mechanics refers to the appearance of words, to how they are spelled or arranged on paper. The fact that the first word of a paragraph is usually indented, for example, is a matter of mechanics. These sentences violate other rules of mechanics:
    
    she dresses beautifully
    She dresses beautifuly.
    
    Conventions of writing require that a sentence begin with a capital letter and end with full-stop punctuation (period, question mark, or exclamation point). Conventions of spelling require that beautifully have two Is.
    
    The rules gathered under the heading of mechanics attempt to make writing consistent and clear. They may seem arbitrary, but they have evolved from centuries of experience. Generally they represent, if not the only way of solving a problem, an economic and efficient way.
    
    Along with mechanics we include punctuation, a very complicated subject and by no means purely mechanical. While some punctuation is cut-and-dried, much of it falls into the province of usage or style. Later, in the chapter on punctuation, we'll discuss the distinctions between mechanical and stylistic uses of commas, dashes, and so on.

    Grammar, usage, and mechanics establish the ground rules of
    writing, circumscribing what you are free to do. Within their
    limits, you select various strategies and work out those strat-
    egies in terms of words, sentences, paragraphs. The ground
    rules, however, are relatively inflexible, broken at your peril.
    
    16 INTRODUCTION
    
    It is not always easy to draw the line between grammar and
    usage or between usage and style. Broadly, grammar is what
    you must do as a user of English; usage, what you should do
    as a writer of more or less formal (or informal) English; and
    style, what you elect to do to work out your strategies and
    realize your purposes.
    
    "Her dresses beautifully," we said, represents an error in
    grammar, and "She dresses beautiful," a mistake in usage.
    "She dresses in a beautiful manner," however, is a lapse in
    style. The sentence breaks no rule of grammar or of usage,
    but it is not effective (assuming that the writer wants to stress
    the idea of "beauty"). The structure slurs the emphasis, which
    should be on the key word and which should close the state-
    
    ments "Sheutifully."
    Most of our difficulties with words and sentences involve
    style. For native speakers, grammar—in sense—is
    likely to be a serious problem. Usage (which includes much
    of what is popularly called "grammar") and mechanics are
    more troublesome. But generally these require simply that
    you learn clearly defined conventions. And having learned
    them, you will find that rather than being restrictive they free
    you to choose more effectively among the options available
    to you as a writer.
    
    Style is less reducible to rule, and more open to argument.
    No one can prove "She dresses in a beautiful manner" is
    poorer than "She dresses beautifully." (One can even imagine
    a context in which the longer sentence would be preferable.)
    Even so, it violates a principle observed by good writers; use
    no more words than you must.
    
    You may think of that principle as a "rule" of style. We
    shall discuss and illustrate that and other stylistic "rules," but
    remember: they are generalizations about what good writers
    do, not laws dictating what all writers must do.

    The ftegt, "thinking," involves choosing a subject, ex-
    ploring ways of developing it, and devising strategies of or-
    ganization and style. The second step, "doing," is usually
    called "drafting"; and the third, "doing again," is "revising."
    The next several chapters take a brief look at these steps of
    the writing process.
    
    First a warning. They're not really "steps," not in the usual
    sense anyway. You don't write by (1) doing all your thinking,
    (2) finishing a draft, and then (3) completing a revision. Ac-
    tually you do all these things at once.
    
    If that sounds mysterious, it's because writing is a complex
    activity. As you think about a topic you are already beginning
    to select words and construct stheenwexdsinto
    draft. As you draft and as you revise, the thinking goes on:
    you discover new ideas, realize you've gone down a dead end,
    discover an implication you hadn't seen before.
    
    It's helpful to conceive of writing as a process having, in a
    broad and loose sense, three steps. But remember that you
    don't move from step to step in smooth and steady progress.
    
    You go back and forth. As you work on a composition you
    will be, at any given point, concentrating on one phase of
    
    writing. But always you are engaged with the process in its
    
    entirety.

    CHAPTER
    
    Looking for Subjects
    
    People write for lots of reasons. Sometimes it's part of the
    job. A sales manager is asked to report on a new market, or
    an executive to discuss the feasibility of moving a plant to
    another state. A psychology student has to turn in a twenty-
    page term paper, or a member of an art club must prepare a
    two-page introduction to an exhibit.
  - |-
    In such cases the subject is given, and the first step is chiefly
    a matter of research, of finding information. Even the prob-
    lem of organizing the information is often bymplified
    lowing a conventional plan, as with scientific papers or busi-
    ness letters. Which is not to dismiss such writing as easy.
    Being clear and concise is never easy. (To say nothing of being
    interesting!) But at least the writing process is structured and
    to that degree simplified.
    
    At other times we write because we want to express some-
    thing about ourselves, about what we've experienced or how
    we feel. Our minds turn inward, and writing is complicated
    by the double role we play. / am the subject, which somehow
    the /who writes must express in words. And there is a further
    complication. In personal writing, words are not simply an
    expression of the self; they help to create the self. In struggling
    to say what we are, we become what we say.
    
    Such writing is perhaps the most rewarding kind. But it is
    20 THE WRITING PROCESS
    
    also the most challenging and the most frustrating. We are
    thrown relentlessly upon our own ddsoundepect is
    
    elusive, and the effect can be a kind of paralysis. And so peo-
    ple say, "I can't think of anything to write about."
    
    That's strange, because life is fascinating. The solution is to
    open yourself to experience. To look around. To describe
    what you see and hear. To read. Reading takes you into other
    minds and enriches your own. A systematic way of enriching
    your ideas and experiences is to keep a commonplace book
    and a journal.
    
    The Commonplace Book
    
    A commonplace book is a record of things we have read or
    heard and want to remember: a proverb, a remark by a writer
    of unusual sensibility, a witty or a wise saying, or even some-
    thing silly or foolish or crass:
    
    Sincerity always hits me something sikep. | mean, if you try to
    get it too hard, you won't. w. H. Auden
    
    Women have served all these centuries as looking glasses possess-
    
    ing the . . . power of reflecting the figure of a man at twice its nat-
    ural size. Virginia Woolf
    [hate vainasicitsestaxcdlly — jimmy Durante
  - |-
    Shrouds have no pockets. English proverb  
    Adbithags-and Yiddish proverb  
    
    To keep a commonplace book, set aside a looseleaf binder.  
    When you hear or read something that strikes you, copy it,  
    identifying the source. Leave space to add thoughts of your  
    own. If you accumulate a lot of entries, you may want to  
    make an index or to group passages according to subject.  
    
    A commonplace book will help your writing in several  
    ways. It will be a storehouse of topics, of those elusive "things  
    to write about." It will provide a body of quotations (occasional quotations add interest to your writing). It will im-  
    prove your prose. (Simply copying well-expressed sentences  
    is one way of learning to write.) Most important, keeping a  
    commonplace book will give you new perceptions and ideas  
    and feelings. It will help you grow.  
    
    The Journal  
    
    A jowumdaleethes from French and originally  
    meant {fdlaa}yto-disy record of what you see, hear,  
    do, think, feel. A journal collects your own experiences and  
    thoughts rather than quotations. But, of course, you may  
    combine the two. If you add your own comments to the pas-  
    sages you copy into a commonplace book, you are also keep-  
    ing a kind of journal.  
    
    Many professional writers use journals, and the habit is a  
    good one for anybody interested in writing, even if he or she  
    has no literary ambitions. Journals store perceptions, ideas,  
    emotions, fstuonsmedHrial for essays or stories.  
    
    The Journals of Henry Thoreau are a famous example, as are  
    A Writer's Diary by Virginia Wedlbtebooks of the  
    
    French novelist Albert Camus, and "A War-time Diary" by  
    the English writer George Orwell.
  - |-
    A journal is not for others to read. So you don't have to worry about niceties of punctuation; you can use abbreviations and symbols like "&." But if a journal is really to help you develop as a writer, you've got to do more than compose trite commonplaces or mechanically list what happens each day. You have to look honestly and freshly at the world around you and at the self within. And that means you have to wrestle with words to tell what you see and what you feel:
    
    July 25, Thursday... . Today: clear, Gtemgepie-chills, dies underfoot.
    | myself am the vessel of tragic experience. rhuse not enough

    ing, out of my sloth, envy and weakness, my own ruins. What do
    the gods ask? must dress, rise, and send my body out.
    
    Sylvia Plath
    
    But journals do not have to be so extraordinary in their sensibility or introspection. Few people are that perceptive. The essential thing is that a journal captures your experience and feelings. Here is another, different example, also fresh and revealing. The writer, Rockwell Stensrud, kept a pournal accompanied an old-time cattle drive staged in 1975 as part of the Bicentennial celebration:
    
    Very strict unspoken rules of cowboy behdiviok—aget
    
    you want the night before, but you'd better be able to get up the
    next morning at 4:30, or you're not living by the code of respect-
    ability. Range codes more severe than high-society ideas of man-

    respect more than anything is ability to carry one's own weight, to
    perform, to get the job done wellih¢heselitions that
    
    make this quest of theirs possible.
    CHAPTER
    
    Exploring for Topics
  - |-
    Before beginning a draft, you need to explore a subject, looking for topics. (Subject refers to the main focus of a composition; topic to specific aspects of the subject. The subject of this book is writing. Within that subject grammar, sentence style, and so on, are topics. Any topic, of course, can itself be analyzed into subtopics.)
    
    Some people like to work through a subject systematically, uncovering topics by asking questions. Others prefer a less structured, less analytical approach, a kind of brainstorming. They just begin to rapidly and loosely, letting ideas tumble out in free association. Then they edit what they've done, discarding some topics, selecting others for further development.
    
    Neither way is better. Which you use depends on your habits of mind, how much you already know about a subject, and of course the subject itself. If you are writing about something that is easily analyzed—why one candidate should be elected, for instance, rather than some other—already thought a good deal about the matter, the analytical, questioning approach is better. But if your subject is more complex, something you haven't thought long and hard, you may get stuck if you try systematic analysis. It might be better to scribble, to get ideas on paper, any ideas, however far-fetched, in whatever order.
    
    Finding Topics by Asking Questions
    
    What happened?
    
    How?
    
    When?
    
    Why? What caused it? What were the reasons?
    How can the subject be defined?
    
    What does it imply or entail?
    
    What limits should be set to it?
    
    Are there exceptions and qualifications?
    
    What examples are there?
    
    Can the subject be analyzed into parts or aspects?
    Can these parts be grouped in any way?
    
    What is the subject similar to?
    
    What is it different from?
    
    Has it advantages or virtues?
    
    Has it disadvantages or defects?
    
    What have other people said about it?
    
    These are general questions, of course; and they are not the only ones you might ask. Particular subjects will suggest others. Nor will all of these questions be equally applicable in every case. But usually five or six will lead to topics.
  - |-
    Suppose, for example, you are interested in how young adults (20 to 30) in the 1960s differ from similar people in the 1990s. Try asking questions. Consider definition. What do you mean by "differ"? Differ how? In dress style? Eating habits? Political loyalties? Lifestyle? Attitudes toward love, sex, marriage? Toward success, work, money?
    
    Already you have topics, perhaps too many. Another question suggests itself: Which of these topics do I want to focus on? Or, put another way: How shall I limit the subject? The choice would not be purely arbitrary; it would depend partly on your interests and partly on your ambitions. In a book you might cover all these topics. In a ten-page paper only one or two or three. We'll imagine a short paper and focus on love, sex, and marriage.
    
    Now you have three major topics. How to organize them? Sex, love, and marriage seems a reasonable order. Next, each topic needs to be explored, which you do by again asking questions. How do the attitudes of the sixties and the nineties differ? Why? For example, look at popular culture (songs, advertisements, magazine articles, films), sociological studies? Can you find useful quotations or stories or movies that support your points? Are there virtues in the attitudes of the nineties? Disadvantages? How do you evaluate those of the sixties? Was a comparable generational shift in values evident in other places and other times?
    
    You're not going to get answers off the top of your head. But at least you know what you're looking for. You can begin to collect information, interviewing friends, studying magazines and movies and television shows, reading novels and stories, looking into scholarly studies of changing social attitudes.
    
    You've got a lot to write about.
  - |-
    Finding Topics by Free Writing  
    or Brainstorming  
    Free writing simply means getting ideas on paper as fast as  
    you can. The trick is to let feelings and ideas pour forth. Jot  
    down anything that occurs to you, without worrying about  
    order or even making much sense. Keep going; to pause is to  
    risk getting stuck, like a car in snow. Move the pencil, writing  
    whatever pops into mind. Don't be afraid of making mistakes  
    or of saying something foolish. You probably will. So what?  
    You're writing for yourself, and if you won't risk saying  
    something foolish, you're not likely to say anything wise.  
    Here's how you might explore the different attitudes of the  
    1M9D¢he 1960s on sex, love, and marriage:  
    
    Seormikesive today. Herpes? AIDS? More conservative mo-  
    rality? Just a generational reaction, a swing of the pendulum?  
    
    16 . THE WRITING PROCESS  
    
    Cooler about love and marriage. Less romantic. Harry and Ellen.  
    Maybe feminism. They have a chance at Careers—prestige,  
    mondyardaeneenied about marriage. Maybe more  
    demanding about men, less willing to accept them on men's own  
    terms. Maybe men leery of modem women.  
    
    Economics? It's a tougher world. Fewer good jobs, more com-  
    petition. Everything casts-hechicgtiains.  
    
    Materialism. Young people seem more materialistic. Concerned  
    with money, worldly success. They want to make it. Be millionaires  
    by thirty. Admiration for winners, fear being losers.  
    
    Less idealistic? Do disillusion and cynicism push toward self-  
    interest? But people in their twenties today aren't really cynical and  
    disillusioned. Never been idealistic enough. They don't have to  
    learn the lesson of The Big Thal. grew up in it.  
    
    Such jottings are not finely reasoned judgments. Many of  
    the ideas are speculative and hastily generalized; some are  
    probably biased. Still, topics have surfaced. The next task  
    would be to look at them closely, rejecting some, choosing  
    others; and then to gather information.

    Thus both methods of exploration have led to topics, the
    rudiments of an essay. But notice that while they cover the
    same general subject, they have led in rather different direc-
    tions. The analytical questions have stressed wabat—the
    ture of the changes in attitude; the free writing has stressed
    wégserthdor the changes.
    
    These different emphases were not planned. They just hap-
    pened. And that suggests an important fact: it is profitable to
    use both methods to explore for topics. Questions have the
    advantage of focusing your attention. But a focused attention
    sees only what is under the lens, and that is a severe limitation.
    Brainstorming can be wasteful, leading in too many direc-
    tions. But it is more likely to extend a subject in unforeseen
    ways and to make unexpected connections.
    
    The two methods, then, are complementary, not antithet-
    ical. Temperamentally, you may prefer one or the other. But
    it's wise to try both.

    appeals to you and explore it for topics. You don't have to agree
    with the idea. The goal is just to get your thoughts on paper.
    
    First, fill one or two pages with free writing. Put down everything
    that comes to mind. Then try the more analytical approach of ask-
    ing questions. (A variation of this exercise is to work with several
    friends; group brainstorming can be more productive than working
    alone.)

    Making a Plan
    
    You've chosen a subject (or had one chosen for you), explored
    it, thought about the topics you discovered, gathered infor-
    mation about them. Now what? Are you ready to begin
    writing?
    
    Well, yes. But first you need a plan. Perhaps nothing more
    than a loose sense of purpose, held in your mind and never
    written piawmraswans call a head arrangement.
    
    Head arrangements can work very yoallhaife the right
    kind of head and if you're thoroughly familiar with the
    subject.
    
    But sometimes all of us (and most times most of us) require
    a more tangible plan. One kind is a statement of purpose;
    another is a preliminary, scratch outline.

    one else's reading them. Even so, you may find on occasion
    that composing a statement of purpose is difficult, perhaps

    It seems to me that today people in their twenties feel differently about sex, love, and marriage than young people did in the 1960s. I'm not claiming the differences are universal, that every young adult today feels one way, while every young adult twenty years ago felt another. Just that the predominant tone has changed. I want to identify and describe these differences, focusing on the nineties, and to discuss why the changes came about. See a problem of organization. Am going to organize primarily around the differences themselves, first attitudes toward sex, then attitudes towards love and marriage? In this case, a discussion of causes would be subordinate. On the other hand, could make the causes my main points of organization, beginning with a relatively detailed discussion of how attitudes today are different, but spending most of the paper in discussing how feminism, the hardening economy, and a tougher, more self-centered approach to life have combined to bring about the changes. Think this second way. What I want readers to see is less of the facts about the new attitudes to-

    Ward sex, love, and marriage, and more of the social and cultural
    causes generating the change.
    
    The Scratch Outline
    
    An outline is a way of dividing a subject into its major parts,
    of dividing these in turn into subparts, and so on, into finer
    and finer detail. There are formal outlines, which are usually
    turned in with a composition and even serve as compositions
    in their own right. And there are informal outlines, often
    called "working" or "scratch" outlines. The formal variety
    follesthat prescribe the alternating use of numbers and
    
    letters and the way in which the analysis must proceed. But
    formal outlines and their rules will not concern us here.
    
    Our interest is in the scratch outline, which serves only the
    writer's use and may be cast in any form that works. Begin
    by asking: What are the major sections of my composition?
    For example:
    
    1.Beginning
    Il. How attitudes toward sex, love, and marriage in the di#f@0s
    from those in the 1960s
    lll. Why the differences occurred
    IV. Closing
    
    Now apply a similar question to each major section:
    
    I.Beginning
    A. Identify subject and establish foeuseasons for the
    change rather than on the change itself
    B. Quality and limit: attitudes in question are the predominat-
    ing ones, those which set the tone of a generation
    Il. How attitudes toward sex, love, and marriage differ in the 1990s
    from those in the 1960s
    A. Seomisbise, less promiscuous
    B. hoivee-ocoobtstely a preemptive good
    32 THE WRITING PROCESS
  - |-
    C. Dialogue material; avoid early marriage, first get career on track  
    III. Why the differences occurred  
    A. Better opportunities for women and greater independence; also stronger sense of their own worth—all this weakens the allure of love and marriage  
    B. Tighter exterior boundaries—more carefully, less room for romantic illusions  
    C. More self-centered view of life—the two conditions above, but becomes a cause in its own right  
    IV. Closing  
    A. The attitudes of the nineties more realistic, less prone to disillusion  
    B. But perhaps idealism has been sacrificed, or weakened, and the prevailing materialism is too ready to sell the world short  
    
    Thus the analysis could go on: the A's and B's broken down, examples introduced, comparisons offered, and so on. Generally, it is better to proceed with the analysis one step at a time, as in the example above. This keeps the whole subject better in mind and is more likely to preserve a reasonable balance. If you exhaustively analyze category I before moving on to II, then carry II down to the end before tackling III, you may lose sight of the overall structure of the composition.  
    
    How far you take a scratch outline depends on the length of your composition and obviously on your willingness to spend time in planning. But the more planning you do, the easier the actual writing will be. A good scratch outline suggests where possible paragraph breaks might come, and the ideas you have jotted down in the headings are the germs of topic statements and supporting sentences.  
    
    But however you proceed and however far you carry the scratch outline, remember that as a plan it is only tentative, subject to change. And the odds are that you will change it. No matter how much you think about a subject or how thoroughly you plan, the actuality of writing opens up unforeseen possibilities and reveals the weakness of points that seemed  
    important. A scratch outline is a guide, but a guide you should never hesitate to change.

    [> Imagine you are going to write an essay of eight or ten pages, using the topics you arrived at by exploring one of the quotations at the end of the preceding chapter. First, compose a statement of purpose for that essay in one or two paragraphs totaling about 250 words. Second, make a scratch outline for the theme, indicating the primary divisions and the major subdivisions within these.]
    
    **Statement of Purpose**
    
    Writing is an iterative process that requires both creativity and revision. As I explore the quotation from the preceding chapter, "A draft is an early version of a piece of writing. Most of us cannot compose anything well at the first try. We must write and rewrite," I am reminded that the journey to a polished final product begins with the initial act of drafting. This essay aims to examine the importance of drafts in the writing process, emphasizing how they serve as a foundation for refinement and improvement. Through the exploration of this quotation, I will highlight the role of drafting in shaping a writer's ideas and how it enables the development of a more coherent and effective final product.
    
    The purpose of this essay is to argue that drafting is not only a necessary step in writing but also an essential part of the creative process. I will discuss how drafts allow writers to experiment with ideas, structure, and language without the pressure of perfection. Furthermore, I will explore how the process of drafting and revising helps writers to identify weaknesses in their work and to make meaningful improvements. By examining the significance of drafts, this essay will demonstrate that the initial version of a text is not only acceptable but often necessary for achieving a high-quality final product.

    However, there is a limit to the similarity between drafting and free writing. Free writing involves exploration and discovery; your pencil should move wherever your mind pushes it. A draft is more restrained. You know, more or less, what you want to do, and the draft is an early version of an organized composition. Therefore you are not as free as in the exploratory phase. If you get into blind alleys in a draft, you must back out and set off in a new direction. The mistake will not be unproductive if it tells you where you don't want to be.
    
    Some people prefer to draft with a pen or pencil; others can work successfully on a typewriter or word processor. If you draft in longhand, skip every other line and leave adequate margins: you will need the space for revisions. If you type, double space. Use only one side of the paper, reserving the other side for extensive changes or additions. When you number the pages of your draft, it's a good idea to include a brief identifying title: "First draft, p. 1," "Second draft, p. 3."
    
    In a composition of any length, consider stopping every so often at a convenient point. Read over what you've written, making corrections or improvements; then type what you've done. Seeing your ideas in print will usually be reassuring. If you don't have a typewriter or word processor, copy the section neatly in longhand; the effect will be much the same. Turn back to the draft; work out the next section; stop again and type. The alternation between drafting and typing will relieve the strain of constant writing and give you a chance to pause and contemplate what you have accomplished and what you ought to do next.

    But this is advice, not dogma. People vary enormously in their writing habits; what works for one fails for another. The best rule is to find a time and a place for writing that enable you to work productively and to follow a procedure you find congenial. You may like to draft in green or purple ink, to listen to music as you write, to compose the entire draft of a ten-page essay and then retype the whole thing instead of doing it section by section. Do what works for you.
    
    36 THE WRITING PROCESS
    
    As a brief sample, here is a draft of the beginning of the composition we've been discussing for the last several chapters—inches—people in the feel about sk29Osve, and marriage.
    
    I have some friends in their late twenties. They live in Chicago, where he is starting out as a lawyer and she as an accountant. Both are presently junior members of large firms, but they are ambitious and hope eventually either to track upward in their companies or to get out on their own. They live together; they say they are in love, and they seem to be. But they are surprisingly cool about it and about the prospect of marriage. "Well," Dee says, "I have my career and Jack has his. It's good we're together, but who knows where we'll be in two years or how we'll feel?" Their coolness surprises me. Find it admirable and yet a bit repelling. Admire their good sense. Still, think to myself, should young love be so cool, so rational, so pragmatic? Is such good sense at so youthful an age perhaps purchased at too great a price? My friends are not, { believe, unusual, not certainly among young, college-educated professionals. The lack of emotional intensity and commitment—about love, at lbastlers@eamt tone of their generation.
    
    How is it different from the attitudes grew up with, the attitudes of the sixties? And why is it different? These are the questions | want to consider.
    
    A good deal of improvement can be made in that draft. First, though, it would help to say something about revision in general.
    
    Revising
  - |-
    Both drafting and revising are creative, but they differ in emphasis. Drafting is more spontaneous and active; revision, more thoughtful and critical. As a writer of a draft you must keep going and not get hung up on small problems. As a reviser you change hats, becoming a demanding reader who expects perfection. When you write you see your words from inside; you know what you want to say and easily overlook
    
    lapses of clarity puzzling to readers. When you revise you put yourself in the reader's place. Of course you cannot get completely outside your own mind, but you can think about what readers know and do not know, what they believe and consider important. You can ask yourself if what is clear to you will be equally clear to them.
    
    To revise effectively, force yourself to read slowly. Some people hold a straightedge so they read only one line at a time, one word at a time if possible. Others read their work aloud. This is more effective (though you cannot do it on all occasions). Reading aloud not only slows you down, it distances you from the words, contributing to that objectivity which successful revision requires. Moreover, it brings another sense to bear: you hear your prose as well as see it. Ears are often more trustworthy than eyes. They detect an awkwardness in sentence structure or a jarring repetition the eyes pass over. Even if you're not exactly sure what's wrong, you hear that something is, and you can tinker with the sentences until they sound better. It also helps to get someone else to listen to or to read your work and respond.
  - |-
    Keep a pencil in hand as you revise (some like a different color). Mark your paper freely. Strike out imprecise words, inserting more exact terms above them (here is the advantage of skipping lines). If you think of another idea or of a way of expanding a point already used, write a marginal note, phrasing it precisely enough so that when you come back to it in an hour or a day it will make sense. If a passage isn't clear, write "clarity?" in the margin. If there seems a gap between paragraphs or between sentences within a paragraph, draw an arrow from one to the other with a question mark. Above all, be ruthless in striking out what is not necessary. A large part of revision is chipping away unnecessary words.
    
    As we study diction, sentences, and paragraph structure, you will become aware of what to look for when you revise, but we shall mention a few basics here. Most fundamental is clarity. If you suspect a sentence may puzzle a reader, figure out why and revise it. Almost as important is emphasis.
    
    Strengthen important points by expressing them in short or unusual sentences. Learn to position semicolons they interrupt a sentence and throw greater weight on important ideas. Look for unsupported generalizations. Even when it is clear, a generalization gains value from illustrative detail.
    
    Sharpen your diction. Avoid awkward repetitions of the same word. Replace vague abstract terms with precise ones having richer, more provocative connotations. Watch for failures of tone: don't offend readers and don't strike poses.
    
    Be alert for errors in grammar and usage and in spelling and typing. Make sure your punctuation is adequate and conventional, but no more frequent than clarity or emphasis requires. Guard against mannerisms of style. All of us have them: beginning too many sentences with "and" or "but"; interrupting the subject and verb; writing long, complicated sentences. None of these is wrong, but any word or sentence pattern becomes a mannerism when it is overworked. One "however" in a paragraph may work well; two attract a reader's notice; three will make him or her squirm.
    
    As an example of revision let's look again at the opening of our imaginary essay.

    are the questions want to consider.
    40 THE WRITING PROCESS
    
    Here now is the revision:
  - |-
    Dee and Jack are an attractive couple in their late twenties—
    bright, well-educated, ambitious. He is starting out as a lawyer, she
    as an pcdountamhbers of large firms, they are commit-
    ted to their careers and eager to move ahead.
    
    They live together. They say they are in love, and they seem to
    be. But they are cool about it, and about the possibility of marriage.
    "Well," Dee says, "I have my career and Jack has his. It's good
    that we're together, but who knows where we'll be in two years?
    Or how we'll feel?"
    
    find their coolness admirable, and yet a bit unsettling. Should
    young love, think to myself, be quite so cool, so rational, so prag-
    matic? Is good sense at so youthful an age purchased at too high a
    price?
    
    Dee and Jack aren't unusual, not among college-educated young
    professionals. Low-keyed emotionalism seems the dominant tone
    of the contemporary song of love. It's all very different from the
    attitudes Shared in the sixties. It occurred to me to wonder why.
    
    I don't think there is any single, simple reason... .
    
    Probably you wouldn't write such extensive marginal notes
    to yourself, but those in dxample suggest how you should
    be thinking. The revisions are toward precision, emphasis,
    and economy.
    
    How many drafts and revisions you go through depends
    on your energy, ambition, and time. Most people who publish
    feel they stopped one draft too soon. Many teachers and ed-
    itors are willing to accept corrections so long as they are not
    so numerous or messy that they interfere with reading. Some,
    on the other hand, do want clean aoppeseshatith
    no corrections, additions, or deletions.
    
    Final Copy
    
    Whether or not you are allowed to revise it, your final copy
    should always be neat and legible. Keep margins of an inch
    or more. If you type, use standard typing paper and type on
  - |-
    Only one side. Double space and correct typos by erasure or tape, not by overstriking. Keep the keys clean and invest now and then in a new ribbon. If you write in longhand, use conventional, lined composition paper. Unless directed otherwise, skip every other line and write only on one side. Leave adequate margins for corrections and comments. Take time to write legibly. No one expects a beautiful copperplate hand, but it is fair to ask for readability.
    
    The Essay
    
    CHAPTER
    
    Beginning
    
    An essay is a relatively short composition. It does not claim scholarly thoroughness (that belongs to the dissertation), it does exhibit great variety. Essays can be about almost anything; they can be speculative or factual or emotional; they can be personal or objective, serious or humorous. The very looseness of the term is a convenience; it would be a mistake to define it too narrowly. Here, essay really will simply mean a short prose piece. There are differences among articles and reports and essays. But they have much in common, and what we say about the beginning, closing, structure, and so on applies generally.
    
    Readers approach any piece of prose with a set of questions. What is this about? Will it interest me? What does the writer intend to do (or not do)? What kind of person is the writer?
    
    To begin effectively you must answer these questions, one way or another. From the writer's point of view, beginning means announcing and limiting the subject, indicating a plan, catching the reader's attention, and establishing an appropriate tone and point of view.
    
    Not all of these matters are equally important. Announcing and limiting the subject are essential. Laying out the plan of the paper and angling for the reader's interest, on the other hand, depend on your purpose and audience. Tone and point
    of view are inevitable: whenever you write you imply them. In the beginning, then, you must establish a tone and point of view conducive to your purpose.
  - |-
    The length of the beginning depends on the length and complexity of what it introduces. In a book the opening might take an entire chapter with dozens of paragraphs. In a short article a single sentence might be adequate. For most essays a single paragraph is enough. Whatever their length, all effective openings fulfill the same functions.
    
    Announcing the Subject
    
    In announcing a subject you have two choices: (1) whether to be explicit or implicit, and (2) whether to be immediate or to delay.
    
    Explicit and Implicit Announcement
    
    In explicit announcement you literally state in some fashion or other, "This is my subject." The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead begins Religion in the Making like this:
    
    It is my purpose to consider the type of justification which is avail-
    able for belief in the doctrines of religion.
    
    The words "It is my purpose" make this an explicit announcement. It would have been implicit had Whitehead begun:
    
    Belief in the doctrines of religion may be justified in various ways.
    
    This sentence does not literally tell readers what the subject is, but the subject is clearly implied.
    
    Because of its clarity, scholars and scientists writing for their colleagues often use explicit announcement. On less formal occasions it may seem heavy-handed. A school theme, for instance, ought not to begin "The purpose of this paper is to contrast college and high school." It is smoother to establish the subject by implication: "College and high school differ in several ways." Readers don't have to be hit over the head. Implicit announcements may appear as rhetorical questions, as in this essay about historians:
    
    What is the historian?
    The historian is he who tells a true story in writing.
    Consider the members of that definition. Hilaire Belloc
    
    Similarly the theme on college and high school might have opened:
    
    In what ways do college and high school differ?
    
    Opening questions, however, can sound mechanical. While better than no announcement at all, or the clumsiness of "The purpose of this paper is," rhetorical questions are not very original. Use them for announcement only when you can do so with originality or when all other alternatives are less attractive.
  - |-
    The same advice holds for opening with a dictionary definition, another way of announcing subjects implicitly. Nothing is inherently wrong in starting off with a quote from a reputable dictionary, but it is trite. Of course a clever or an unusual definition may make a good opening. John Dos Passos's definition of college as "four years under the ethercone" is certainly novel and provocative and might make a fine beginning.
    
    When the purpose of an essay is to define a word or idea, it is legitimate to start from the dictionary. But these exceptions admitted, the dictionary quotation, like the rhetorical question, has been overworked as a way of implying the subject.
    
    48 THE ESSAY
    
    Immediate and Delayed Announcement
    
    Your second choice involves whether to announce the subject immediately or to delay. This opening line of an essay called "Selected Snobberies" by the English novelist Aldous Huxley falls into the Garstgory:
    
    All men are snobs about something.
    
    Letting readers in on the subject at once is a no-nonsense, businesslike procedure. But an immediate announcement may not hold much allure. If the subject is of great interest, or if the statement is startling or provocative (like Huxley's), it will catch a reader's eye. Generally, however, immediate announcement is longer on clarity than on interest.
    
    So you may prefer to delay identifying the subject. Delay is usually achieved by beginning broadly and narrowing until you get down to the subject. The critic Susan Sontag, for instance, uses this beginning for an essay defining "Camp" (a deliberately pretentious style in popular art and entertainment):
    
    Many things in the world have not been named; and many things, even if they have been named, have never been described. One of these is the sead#yitity—vananistakadpiis-
    
    tication but hardly identical with geethay the name of "Camp."
    
    Less commonly the subject may be delayed by focusing outward, opening with a specific detail or example and broadening to arrive at the subject. Aldous Huxley opens an essay on "Tragedy and the Whole Truth" in this manner:
  - |-
    There were six of them, the best and the bravest of the hero's companions. Turning back from his post in the bows, Odysseus was in time to see them lifted hetaiggtingear their screams,
    
    BEGINNING 49
    
    the desperate repetition of his own name. The survivors could only look on, helplessly, while Scylla "at the mouth of her cave devoured them, still screaming, still stretching out their hands to me in the frightful struggle." And Odysseus adds that it was the most dreadful and lamentable sight he ever saw in all his "explorings of the passes of the sea." We can believe it; Homer's brief description (the too-poetical simile is a later interpolation) convinces us.
    
    Later, the danger passed, Odysseus and his men went ashore for the night, and, on the Sicilian beach, prepared their supper—prepared it, says Homer, "expertly." The Twelfth Book of the Odyssey concludes with these words: "When they had satisfied their thirst and hunger, they thought of their dear companions and wept, and in the midst of their tears sleep came gently upon them."
    
    The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth—how the older literatures ever told it! Bits of the truth, yes; every good book gives us bits of the truth, would not be a good book if it did not. But the whole truth, no. Of the great writers of the past incredibly few have given us that. Homer—eftine Odyssey—os those few.
    
    It is not until the third paragraph that Huxley closes in on his subject, of which the episode from the Odyssey is an example.
    
    Delayed announcement has several advantages. It piques readers' curiosity. They know from the title that the opening sentences do not reveal the subject, and they are drawn in to see where they are headed. Curiosity has a limit, however; you can tease readers too long.
  - |-
    A broad beginning can also clarify a subject, perhaps supplying background or offering examples. Finally, delayed announcement can be entertaining in its own right. There is a pleasure like that of watching a high-wire performer in observing an accomplished writer close in on a subject.
    
    More immediate announcement, on the other hand, is called for in situations where getting to the point is more important than angling for readers or entertaining them. How you announce your subjects with so much in writing, depends on purposes and reasons for addressing your readers.
    
    Limiting the Subject
    
    In most cases a limiting sentence or clause must follow the announcement of the subject. Few essays (or books, for that matter) discuss all there is to say; they treat some aspects of a subject but not others. As with announcement, limitation may be explicit or implicit. The first—in which the writer says, in effect, "I shall say such and such"—is commonly used in formal, scholarly writing. The grammarian Karl By-Keegans an article entitled "Where Our Grammar Came From":
    
    The title of this paper is too brief to be quite accurate. Perhaps with the following subtitle it does not promise too much: A partial account of the origin and development of the attitudes which commonly pass for grammatical in Western culture and particularly in English-speaking societies.
    
    On informal occasions one should limit the subject less literally, implying the boundaries of the paper rather than literally stating them:
    
    Publishers, as told, are worried about their business, and so am I. But I am not sure that the actual state of their affairs disturbs me quite so much as some of the analyses of it and some of the proposals for remedying what is admittedly an unsatisfactory situation. Joseph Wood Krutch
  - |-
    Besides being explicit or implicit, limitation may also be
    positive or negative (or both). The paragraphs by Dykema
    and Krutch tell us what the writers will do; they limit the
    subject in a positive sense. In the following case the English
    writer and statesman John Buchan tells what he will not do
    
    BEGINNING 51
    
    (the paragraph opens the chapter "My America" of his book
    Pilgrim's Way):
    
    The title of this chapter exactly defines its contents. It presents the
    American scene as it appears to one pbserver-view
    
    which does not claim to be that mysterious thing, objective truth.
    There will be no attempt to portray the "typical" American, for |
    have never known one. have met a multitude of individuals, but
    Ishould not dare to take any one of them as representing his coun-
    tryeings that other mysterious thing, the average man. You
    
    can point to certain qualities which are more widely distributed in
    America than elsewhere, but you will scarcely find human beings
    who possess all these qualities. One good American will have most
    of them; another, equally good and not less representative, may
    have few or none. So &hall eschew generalities. If you cannot
    indict a nation, no more can you label it like a museum piece.
    
    Some binimattionpespliettor negative—
    is necessary at the beginning of most essays. Term papers,
    long formal essays whose purpose is to inform, technical and
    scholarly articles, all may have to engage in extensive bound-
    ary fixing to avoid misleading or disappointing the reader.
    Shorter themes, however, do not require much limitation.
    Readers learn all they really need to know by an opening
    sentence like this:
    
    College is different from high school in several ways—especially
    in teaching, homework, and tests.
    
    The final phrase conveys the limitations, following the an-
    nouncement in the first clause of the sentence. The subject is
    a contrast between college and high school, the focus is on
    college, and the contents are limited to three specific points
    of difference. That is limitation enough for a brief, informal
    essay, and the writer can get on with the discussion without
    a heavy statement like this:
    
    Ishall limit the contrast to teaching methods, homework, and tests.

    There is no rule to test whether you have limited a subject sufficiently. Just put yourself in the reader's place and ask if it is clear (whether by direct statement or by implication) what the essay will do and what it will not do.
    
    Indicating the Plan of the Essay
    
    Another function of the beginning, though not an invariable one, is to clarify how the essay will be organized. The writer has the plan in mind when composing the beginning paragraph (or revising it). The question is: Should the plan be revealed to the reader?
    
    Writers often do consider it necessary. Harold Mattingly, in *Roman Imperial Civilization*, uses this paragraph:
    
    The object of this first chapter is to give a sketch of the Empire which may supply a background to all that follows: to explain what the position of Emperor from time to time was, how it was defined in kasw it was interpreted by the subjects; then, around the Emperor, to show the different parts of the State in relation to one another and to him. Later chapters will develop particular themes. We shall have to consider at the close how far the constitution of the Empire was satisfactory for its main purposes, how much truth there is in the contention that imperfections in the constitution were a main cause of Decline and Fall.
    
    The paragraph indicates not only the plan of the first chapter and that of the whole book, but also how the opening chapter fits into the larger organization.
    
    Even with subjects less complex and grand than the Roman Empire, writers may wish to tell us how they intend to develop their essays:
    
    I want to tell you about a woodsman, what he was like, what his work was, and what it meant. His name was Alfred D. Teare and he came originally from Nova Scotia, but all the time knew him
    
    his home was in Berlin, New Hampshire. Probably the best surveyor of old lines in New England, he was—in a way——a genius. Kenneth Andler
  - |-
    This straightforward paragraph not only announces and limits the subject but also reveals something about the organization of the essay. Readers are prepared for a three-part structure: Teare as a person, the nature of his work, and the significance of that work. Assuming that the writer knows his subject as he does, he mentions these aspects of his subject reflects the order in which he will treat them. The plan has been outlined and effectively.
    
    Establishing your plan in the beginning has several virtues. It eases the reader's task. Knowing where they are headed, readers can follow the flow of ideas. An initial indication of the organization also simplifies later problems of transition. When a writer can assume that readers understand the general scheme of the essay, it is easier to move them from point to point.
    
    As with limiting the subject, one cannot set down clear-cut rules about when to reveal the plan. Generally it is wise to indicate something about the organization of compositions that are relatively long and that fall into several well-defined parts. Shorter, simpler essays less often require that their plan be established in the opening paragraph.
    
    When you must indicate your plan, do so as subtly as you can. The imaginary theme about high school and college that begins:
    
    College is different from high school in several ways—especially in teaching methods, homework, and tests.
    
    clearly implies the three parts of the essay and their order. In longer work you may occasionally feel it desirable to indicate organization explicitly. But be sure that your subject is substantial enough and your purpose serious enough to support such a beginning.
    
    $4 THE ESSAY
    
    Interesting the Reader
    
    Sometimes you can take readers' interest for granted. Scholars and scientists writing for learned journals, for instance, do not have to make much effort to catch their readers' attention. More commonly a writer's audience includes at least some people whose interest must be deliberately sought. Several strategies for doing this are available.
    
    Stressing the Importance of the Subject
  - |-
    The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.
    
    Treat the reader as a reasonable, intelligent person with a desire to be well informed and say, in effect: "Here is something you should know or think about." The American poet and critic John Béahep begins an essay on Picasso with this sentence:
    
    There is no painter who has so spontaneously and so profoundly reflected his age as Pablo Picasso.
    
    Arousing Curiosity
    
    This is usually a more effective strategy than stressing the importance of the subject. You may play upon curiosity by opening with a short factual statement that raises more questions than it answers. Astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington begins a chapter in his book The Philosophy of Science with this statement:
    
    I believe there are 15,747,724,136,275,002,577,605,653,691,181,555,468,044,717,914,527,116,709,366,231,425,076,185,631,031,296 protons in the universe and the same number of electrons.
    
    It would be a curiously incurious reader who would not boggle at this and read on to learn how the writer arrived at so precise a figure.
    
    A short step from such interest-arousing factual openings
    
    is the cryptic beginning, that is, a mysterious or not quite clear statement. Charles Lamb opens an essay with
    
    I have no ear.
    
    We soon learn that he means "no ear for music," but for a moment we are startled.
    
    To be effective a cryptic opening must not simply be murky. It must combine clarity of statement with mystery of intent. We know what it says, but we are puzzled about why. The mystery has to be cleared up rather quickly if the reader's interest is to be retained. For most of us curiosity does not linger; without satisfaction it goes elsewhere.
    
    Carrying mystification a little further, you may open with a rhetorical pretension—that appears to contradict reality as we know it. Hilaire Belloc begins his essay "The Barbarians" this way:
    
    It is a pity true history is not taught in the schools.
    
    Readers who suppose true history is taught may be annoyed, but they are likely to go on.

    Sometimes mystification takes the form of a non sequitur, that is, an apparently nonlogical sequence of ideas. An enterprising student began a theme:
    
    I hate botany, which is why I went to New York.
    
    The essay revealed a legitimate connection, but the seeming logic fulfilled its purpose of drawing in the reader.
    
    Amusing the Reader
    
    Aside from arousing their curiosity, you may attract readers by amusing them. One strategy is to open with a witty remark, often involving an allusion to a historical or literary
    figure. Francis Bacon opens his essay "Of Truth" with this famous sentence:
    
    What is truth? said jesting Pilate and would not stay for an answer.
    
    A contemporary writer alludes both to Pontius Pilate and to Bacon by adapting that beginning for the essay "What, Then, Is Culture?":
    
    "What is truth?" said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an
    answer.
    "What is culture? said a certain man to me not long since,
    and though he stayed for an answer, he did not get one.
    Katherine Fullerton-Gerould
    
    Another variety of the entertaining opening is the anecdote. Anecdotes have a double value, attracting us once by their intrinsic wittiness and then by the skill with which writers
    apply them to the subject. In the following opening Nancy Mitford describes the history of the French salon, a social gathering of well-known people who discuss politics, art, and
    so on:
    
    "What became of that man Used to see sitting at the end of your
    table?" someone asked the famous eighteenth-century Paris hostess,
    Néeffrin.
    
    "He was my husband. He is dead." It is the epitaph of all such
    husbands. The hostess of a salon (the useful word salonniere, un-
    fortunately, is an Anglo-Saxon invention) must not be encumbered
    by family life, and her husband, if he exists, must know his place.
    
    The salon was invented by the Marquise de Rambouillet at the
    beginning of the seventeenth century.
  - |-
    Mitford's story is amusing, in a cynical fashion. More important, it leads naturally into her subject. Naturally—that
    important, for an opening anecdote fails if forced upon the subject from the outside.
    
    BEGINNING 57
    
    Still another entertaining opening strategy is the clever and
    apt comparison. It may be an analogy, as in the following
    passage by Virginia Woolf of the opening paragraph of her essay "Reviewing":
    
    In London there are certain shop windows that always attract a
    crowd. The attraction is not in the finished article but in the worn-
    out garments that are having patches inserted in them. The crowd
    is watching the women at work. There they sit in the shop window
    putting invisible stitches into moth-eaten trousers. And this familiar
    sight may serve as an illustration to the following paper. So our
    poets, playwrights, and novelists sit in the shop window, doing their
    work under the eyes of reviewers.
    
    Notice, incidentally, the skill with which Woolf focuses
    upon the subject.
    
    A comparison calculated to arouse interest may be a simile
    or metaphor. G. K. Chesterton wittily begins an essay "On
    Monsters" with this metaphorical comparison:
    
    I saw in an illustrated paper—window—wickcien tific news——
    that a green-blooded fish had been found in the sea; indeed a crea-
    ture that was completely green, down to this uncanny ichor in its
    veins, and very big and venomous at that. Somehow Could not
    get it out of my head, because the caption suggested a perfect re-
    frain for a Ballade: A green-blooded fish has been found in the sea.
    It has so wide a critical and philosophical application. I have
    known so many green-blooded fish on the land, walking about the
    streets and sitting in the clubs, and especially the committees. So
    many green-blooded fish have written books and criticism of books,
    have taught in academies of learning and founded schools of phi-
    losophy that they have almost made themselves the typical biolog-
    ical product of the present age of evolution.
  - |-
    Chesterton uses "green-blooded fish" as a metaphor for all self-centered, dehumanized people, and the metaphor attracts us by its originality.
    58 THE ESSAY
    
    A Word About Titles
    
    The type of an essay precedes the beginning and should clarify the subject and arouse interest. The title, however, does not take the place of a beginning paragraph. In fact it is good practice to make an essay self-sufficient, purpose, plan (if needed) are all perfectly clear without reference to a title.
    
    As to titles themselves, they should ideally be both informative and eye-catching. It is difficult in practice to balance these qualities, and most titles come down on one side or the other; they are informative but not eye-catching, or unusual and attractive but not especially informative. In either case a title ought to be concise.
    
    If you start your essay with a title in mind, be sure it fits the theme as it actually evolves. In the process of composition, essays have a way of taking unexpected twists and turns. For this reason it may be well not to decide on a final title until you see what you have actually written.
    
    Conclusion
    
    When composing beginnings, inexperienced writers are likely to err at either of two extremes: doing too little or doing too much. In doing too little they slight the opening, jumping too suddenly into the subject and piling ideas and information in front of the reader before he or she has time to settle back and see what all this is about.
    
    In doing too much they make the beginning a precis of the essay and anticipate everything they will cover. The function of an opening is to introduce an essay, not to be a miniature version of it. To make it so is to act as inappropriately as the master of ceremonies at a banquet who introduces the main speaker by anticipating everything he or she is going to say.
    
    The effective beginning stays between those extremes. It lets readers know what to expect, but it leaves them something to expect.

    For Practice
    
    > In about W@ds, compose a beginning paragraph either for
  - |-
    The theme you outlined at the close of the preceding chapter or for one or another topic of interest. Make sure that readers understand your general subject, the limitations of your treatment, and your organization. Be implicit: do not write, "The subject will be..."; "The plan to be followed is... ." Try to interest your readers and to establish a point of view and a tone appropriate to your purpose.
    
    > In conjunction with the exercise above, answer these questions, devoting several sentences or a brief paragraph to each:
    
    A. What strategy did you use to interest your readers?
    
    B. What tone were you seeking to establish—specifically, you feel about the subject, how did you wish readers to view you, and what kind of relationship did you hope to establish with them? Explain also how these aspects of tone led you to choose certain words in your beginning paragraph.
    
    CHAPTER
    
    Closing
    
    Like the opening of an essay, the closing should be proportional to the length and complexity of the whole piece. Several paragraphs, or only one, or even a single sentence may be sufficient. But whatever its length, a closing must do certain things.
    
    Termination
    
    The most obvious function of a closing is to say, "The end." There are several ways of doing this.
    
    Terminal Words
    
    The simplest is to employ a word or phrase like "in conclusion," "concluding," "finally," "lastly," "in the last analysis," "to close," "in closing," and so on. Adverbs showing a loose consequential relationship also work: "then," "and so," "thus." Generally it is best to keep such terminal words unobtrusive. In writing, the best technique hides itself.
    
    Circular Closing
    
    This strategy works on the analogy of a circle, which ends where it began. The final paragraph repeats an important phrase from the opening, thereby creating a sense of completion and cohesion. This approach not only signals the end but also reinforces the main idea or theme of the essay, providing a satisfying conclusion for the reader. The circular closing is effective because it ties together the beginning and end of the piece, offering a sense of closure and completeness. It is particularly useful in essays that aim to convey a clear, central message or argument. By repeating key phrases or ideas from the introduction in the conclusion, the writer ensures that the reader is reminded of the main points and the purpose of the essay. This technique also helps to reinforce the writer's point of view and tone, making it more memorable for the reader. In this way, the circular closing serves both as a functional ending and as a stylistic device that enhances the overall impact of the essay.

    A word or phrase prominent in the beginning, something the reader will remember. If the strategy is to work, the reader has to recognize the key term (but of course you cannot hang a sign on this" Réfpennhest stress it more subtly, perhaps by position or by using an unusual, memorable word. In an essay of any length it may be wise to repeat the phrase now and again, and sometimes writers emphasize the fact of completion by saying something like, "We return, then, to...."
    
    In a sketch of a famous aristocrat, Lady Hester Stanhope, the biographer Lytton Strachey opens with this paragraph:
    
    The Pitt nose [Lady Stanhope belonged to the famous Pitt family] has a curious history. One can watch its transmigrations through three lives. The tremendous hook of Old Lord Chatham, under whose curves Empires came to birth, was succeeded by the bleak upward-pointing nose of William Pitt the yigithggm—the bol of an indomitable hauteur. With Lady Hester Stanhope came the final stage. The nose, still with an upward tilt in it, had lost its masculinity; the hard bones of the uncle and grandfather had disappeared. Lady Hester's was a nose of wild ambitions, of pride grown fantastical, a nose that scorned the earth, shooting off, one fancies, towards some eternally eccentric heaven. It was a imose, fact, altogether in the air.
    
    And here are the final three sentences of Strachey's sketch:
    
    The end came in June, H88Gervants immediately possessed themselves of every moveable object in the house. But Lady Hester cared no longer: she was lying back in her bed—inexplicable, grand, preposterous, with her nose in the air.
    
    Not only does Strachey's phrase latch the end of his essay to its beginning, it also conveys his attitude toward Lady Hes-ter Stanhope. The expression that completes the circle necessarily looms large in the reader's mind, and it must be genuinely important.
    
    Rhythmic Variation
  - |-
    Prose rhythm is complex. Here it is enough to understand that, however it works, rhythm is inevitable and important. Because it is, you can use it to signal the closing by varying the movement of the final sentence or sentences.
    
    Usually the variation is to slow the sentence and make its rhythm more regular. A famous example is the end of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland:
    
    Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the aftertime, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood; and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with her dream of Wonderland of long ago; and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child life, and the happy summer days.
    
    The passage is slowed by interrupting constructions (for example, "in the aftertime") and regularized by repeating similar constructions ("and how," for instance) to create an almost poetic rhythm (the X marks unstressed syllables and the / denotes stressed):
    
    xX xX / xX / xX /
    and the happy summer days.
    
    Occasionally writers take the other tack and close with a short, quick sentence rather than a long, slow, regular one. Such an ending is most effective played against a longer statement, as in this passage, which concludes Joan Didion's essay "On Morality":
    
    Because when we start deceiving ourselves into thinking not that we want something or need something, not that it is a pragmatic necessity for us to have it, but that it is a moral imperative that we have it, then is when we join the fashionable madmen, and then is when the thin whine of hysteria is heard in the land, and then is when we are in bad trouble. And think we are already there.
    
    Failing to use a brief sentence as a way of ending sometimes wastes a potentially good closing:
  - |-
    At last the hardworking housewife is ready to watch her favorite  
    television program, but before fifteen minutes are up she is sound  
    asleep in her chair and before she realizes it the 6:30 alarm is going  
    off and it is time to start another day.
    
    It is better like this:
    
    Before she realizes it the 6:30 alarm is going off. Another day.
    
    Natural Point of Closing
    
    A flag of signaling the end is simply to stop at a natural  
    point, one built into the subject. For example, in a biographical sketch of someone who is dead the obvious place to end  
    is with the death scene, as in the passage quoted earlier by Lytton Strachey about Lady Hester Stanhope. Another instance is this paragraph, the end of Llewelyn Powys's essay "Michel de Montaigne":
    
    On September, Michel de Montaigne, having distributed  
    certain legacies to his servants, summoned his parish priest to his  
    bedside, and there in his curious room with the swallows already  
    gathering on the leaden gutters outside, he heard Mass said for the  
    last time in the company of certain of his neighbors. With due  
    solemnity the blessed sacrament was elevated, and at the very mo-  
    ment that this good heretical Catholic and Catholic heretic (un-  
    mindful for once of his nine learned virgins) was raising his arms  
    in seemly devotion toward the sacred which in its essence—que  
    spagnjeer might not, contain a subtle and crafty secret, he  
    
    fell back dead.
      
    64 THE ESSAY
    
    Here the effectiveness of closing with the death scene is  
    reinforced by the careful construction of the last sentence, which does not complete its main thought until the very final  
    word. "Dead" falls into place like the last piece of a puzzle.
    
    Natural closings are not restricted to deathbed descriptions. Writing about your daily routine, for instance, you might well  
    end with some variation of the phrase the diarist Samuel Pepys made famous: "And so to Beds?" when a subject  
    does not have a built-in closing, a comparison or figure of  
    speech can provide one.
  - |-
    These, then, are some of the ways of making clear that you are through. The various techniques do not exclude one another; they are often combined. Nor are these the only devices of closing. Inventive writers tailor their endings to subject and purpose. The poet Dylan Thomas wittily concludes his essay "How To Begin a Story" by doing what inexperienced writers should not stop midway:
    
    I see there is little, or no, time to continue my instructional essay on "How To Begin a Story." "How To End a Story" is, of course, a different matter... . One way of ending a story is. ...
    
    And Virginia Woolf's essay called "Reading" with this sentence:
    
    Some offering we must make; some act we must dedicate, if only to move across the room and turn the rose in the jar, which, by the way, has dropped its petals.
    
    It is difficult to say why this works. The rhythm is important. But so is the image. The flower that has dropped its petals is perhaps a metaphor of ending. And the seeming irrelevancy of the final clause also signals finality, like the gracious closing of a conversation. In any case, the passage ends the essay neatly and unmistakably. That is the important thing.
    
    CLOSING 65
    
    Summation and Conclusion
    
    Termination is always a function of the closing paragraph or sentence. Sometimes, depending on subject and purpose, you may need to make a summary or to draw a conclusion, in the sense of a final inference or judgment.
    
    Summaries are more likely in long, complicated papers. Usually they are signaled by a phrase like in summary, to sum up, summing up, in short, in fine, to recapitulate. The label may be more subtle: "We have seen, however..." is usually a virtue in such matters.
    
    Logical conclusions or judgments may be necessary even in short essays. Certain subjects make them obligatory. Here the journalist Samuel Hopkins Adams concludes an article on the controversial Warren Harding (the twenty-ninth president, who served from 1921 to 1923):
  - |-
    The anomaly of Warren Gamaliel Harding's career is that without wanting, knowing, or trying to do anything at all, he became the figurehead for the most flagrantly corrupt regime in our history. It was less his fault than that of the country at large. Maneuvered by the politicians, the American people selected to represent them one whom they considered an average man. But the job they assigned him is not an average job. When he proved incapable of meeting its requirements, they blamed him and not themselves.
    That is the tragedy of Harding.
    
    On occasion it may not be the best strategy, or even be possible, to round off an essay with a neat final judgment.
    The novelist Joseph Conrad once remarked that the business of the storyteller is to ask questions, not to answer them. That truth applies sometimes to the essayist, who may wish to suggest a judgment rather than to formulate one. The strategy is called an implicative closing. The writer stops short, allowing the reader to infer the conclusion. In effect the final sentences
    open a door instead of closing one. Here, for instance, is the ending of an essay about a teenage hangout:
    
    The old lady who lives across the street from the place says that
    the most striking thing is the momentary silences which, now and
    again, break up the loud, loud laughter.
    
    CHAPTER 3 ()
    Organizing the Middle
    
    Just as an essay must begin and end well, so it must be clearly
    organized in between. An important part of a writer's job is
    assisting readers in following the organization. It can be done
    in two ways, which are often used together. One is by sign-
    posts (occasionally even a short
    paragraph) which tells readers what you have done, are doing,
    will do next, or even will not do at all. The other way is by
    interparagraph transitions, that is, words and phrases that tie
    the beginning of a new paragraph to what precedes it.
    
    Signposts
  - |-
    The most common signpost is an initial sentence that indicates both the topic and the general plan of treating it. For instance, the scientist J. B. S. Haldane organizes a five-paragraph section of a long essay like this:
    
    Science impinges upon ethics in at least five different ways. In the first place ...
    
    Secondly .
    
    Thirdly ...
    
    Fourthly ..
    
    Fifthly ...
    68 THE ESSAY
    
    Sequence may be signaled by actual numbers or letters— usually enclosed in parentheses. first, second, in the first place, and so on. The poet W.Yeats explains why he believes in magic:
    
    I believe in the practice and philosophy of what we have agreed to call magic, in what must call the evocation of spirits, though I do not know what they are, in the power of creating magical illusions, in the visions of truth in the depths of the mind when the eyes are closed; and believe in three doctrines, which have, as I think, been handed down from early times, and been the foundation of nearly all magical practices. These doctrines are—
    
    1. That the borders of our mind are ever shifting, and that many minds can flow into one another, and create or reveal a single mind, a single energy.
    
    2. That the borders of our memories are as shifting, and that our memories are a part of one great memory, the memory of Nature herself.
    
    3. That this great mind and great memory can be evoked by symbols.
    
    Numbers, however, and number words like first, second, third, must be handled cautiously. Overused, they confuse readers, losing them in a labyrinth of (1)s and (2)s and (a)s and (b)s.
    
    Rather than using numbers, it is better, if possible, to set up an analysis by employing key terms. These identify the major points and can be repeated at the beginning of the appropriate paragraph or section. For example, the television critic Edith Efron, discussing soap operas, writes:
    
    Almost all dramatic tension and moral conflict emerge from three basic sources: mating, marriage and babies.
    
    She begins the next paragraph by picking up the key word "mating":
  - |-
    The mating process is the cornerstone of the sysvahue
    ORGANIZING THE MIDDLE 69
    
    And the following paragraph she opens by using the loose
    synonym "domesticity" to link "marriage and babies":
    
    If domesticity is a marital "good," aversion to it is a serious evil.
    
    Signposts demand consistency. Once you begin using them
    you must carry through. Some writers make the mistake of
    starting off with something like this:
    
    There were three reasons why the pact was not satisfactory. First.
    
    But then they fail to introduce the next two reasons with the
    obligatory second or third (or secondly, finally). The lack of
    signals may confuse readers who fail to recognize when the
    writer passes from one reason to another.
    
    Aside from setting up a group of paragraphs, signposts may
    also anticipate future sections of an essay or make clear what
    will not be treated. Few subjects divide neatly into watertight
    compartments. As you develop one point, you touch upon
    another that you do not plan to discuss fully until later or
    perhaps not to discuss at all. When this happens you may wish
    to give a warning.
    
    Signposts may also point backward, reminding readers of
    something treated earlier which bears upon the current topic.
    Thus a writer may say "(See page 8)," or "As we saw in
    Chapter 7...."
    
    The signposts we have looked at are intrinsic—that
    are actually a part of the writer's text. There are also extrinsic
    signposts, ones that stand outside the actual discussion yet
    clue readers to its organization. An outline or a table of con-
    tents is such an extrinsic signal. So are chapter titles, subtitles
    of sections, running heads at the top of each page.
    
    Typography and design convey other extrinsic indications
    of organization: the indentation of paragraph beginnings and
    of quotations, the extra spacing between lines to signal a new
    major section, and occasionally the numerals (usually Roman)
    centered above the division of an essay. Philosophical and
    scientific writers sometimes use a more elaborate system, be-
    ginning each paragraph with a two-part number, the first digit
    to designate the chapter, the second the paragraph.
    
    Interparagraph Transitions

    Transitions link a paragraph to what has immediately pre-
    ceded it. They occur at or near the beginning of the new para-
    graph because it represents a turn of thought, needing to be
    linked to what has gone before. Transitions act like railroad
    switches, smoothing and easing the turn from one track to
    another.
    
    The Repetitive Transition
    
    The simplest type of transition repeats a key word. Writing
    about the Louisiana politician Huey Long, Hodding Carter
    ends one paragraph and begins the next with the following
    link (the italics are added in this and in all following examples,
    unless noted otherwise):
    
    Behind Huey were the people, and the people wanted these things.
    And with the people behind him, Huey expanded ominously.
    
    A repeated word makes a strong and simple connection. It
    works well when the key term leading into the new paragraph
    occurs naturally at the end of the preceding one. But it is
    awkward and artificial when the term is forced into the final
    sentence merely to set up the transition.
    
    The Quaasitioand-Answer
    
    A second way of linking paragraphs is to ask and answer a
    rhetorical question. Usually the question is placed at the end
    of the preceding paragraph and the answer at the beginning
    of the following one. Nancy Mitford, commenting upon the
    apparently compulsive need of tourists to travel, concludes
    one paragraph and opens the next like this:
    
    Why do they do it?
    The answer is that the modern dwelling is comfortable, conven-
    ient, and clean, but it is not a home.
    
    Less often the question appears at the opening of the new
    paragraph, as in this discussion of the ultimate defeat of the
    Crusades:
    
    With want of enthusiasm, want of new recruits, want, indeed, of
    stout purpose, the remaining Christian principalities gradually
    crumbled. Antioch fell in 1268, the Hospitaler fortress of Sesk
    Chevaliers in h2Al91, with the capture of the last great
    stronghold, Acre, the Moslems had regained all their possessions,
    and the great crusades ended, in failure.
    
    Wirt went wrong? There was a failure of morale
    clearly... . Morris Bishop
  - |-
    The question-and-answer transition makes a very strong tie, but, as with the rhetorical question generally, it is too obvious a strategy to be called upon very often.
    
    The Summarizing Transition
    
    This link begins with a phrase or clause that sums up the preceding paragraph and then moves to the main clause, which introduces the new topic. (Unless idiom prohibits it, the elements of the transition should always be in that order: summary of old topic, statement of new one.)
    
    - and while-clauses frequently carry such transitions:
    
    If Went through anguish in botany and diffeeabomics—for
    reasensvegymonseum James Thurber
    
    But while Bernard Shaw pleasantly surprised innumerable cranks
    and revolutionists by finding quite rational arguments for them,
    he surprised them unpleasantly also by discovering something
    else. G. K. Chesterton
    
    Long summarizing transitions tend to be formal in tone.
    On informal occasions it may be better to avoid a full if- or
    whidestisus¢ke summary more briefly. Here, for
    example, a writer moves from the topic of college teaching
    methods to that of personal responsibility:
    
    Because of these differences in teaching methods, college throws
    more responsibility upon the student.
    
    A summarizing transition may take even briefer form, us-
    ing pronouns like this, that, these, those, or such to sum up
    the preceding topic. The historian J. Fred Ryppy from
    the severe geographical conditions of South America to a dis-
    cussion of its resources:
    
    These are grave handicaps. But Latin America has many resources
    in compensation.
    
    Although the "these" in that example is perfectly clear,
    such pronouns can be ambiguous when used as the subjects
    of sentences, especially when they refer to the whole of a long,
    complex idea. If you do use such a pronoun in this way, be
    sure that readers understand what it refers to. Should there
    be a doubt, make the pronoun an adjective modifying a word
    or phrase that fairly sums up the preceding point: for example,
    "These handicaps are grave."
    
    Logical Transitions

    Finally, you may link paragraphs by words showing logical
    relationships: therefore, however, but, consequently, thus, and
    so, even so, on the other hand, for instance, nonetheless, and
    many, many more. In the following passage the historian and
    political scientist Richard Hofstadter is contrasting "intelli-
    gence" and "intellect." In the first paragraph he defines "in-
    telligence." By placing the transitional phrase on the other
    hand near the beginning of the second paragraph, he signals
    the other half of the contrast:
    
    . intelligence is an excellence of mind that is employed within a
    fairly narrow, immediate, and predictable range. . . . Intelligence
    works within the framework of limited but clearly stated goals.
    
    Intellect, on the other hand, is the critical, creative, and contem-
    plative side of mind.
    
    Here is another dissection—aof Hamlet—in
    which moreover indicates that the new paragraph will develop
    an extension of the preceding idea:
    
    Ifntay quote again from Mr. theTiblgatel,very lack of a
    
    rigorous type of causal logic seems to be a part of its point.
    Moreover, the matter goes deeper than this. Hamlet's world is
    
    preeminently in the interrogative mode. Mack Maynard
    
    Logical connectives seldom provide the only link between
    paragraphs. Actually, they work in conjunction with word
    repetitions, summaries, pronouns. In fact, all the various tran-
    sitional strategies we have looked at commonly occur in some
    combination. But whatever its form, an interparagraph tran-
    sition should be clear and unobtrusive, shifting readers easily
    from one topic to the next.
    
    For Practice
    
    > Read closely an essay or article you like and study how the
    writer links paragraphs.
    
    > Go through something you have written and underline the link-
    ages between paragraphs. If you find places where the connections
    seem weak, improve them.
    
    CHAPTER
    
    Point of View, Persona, and
    Tone
    
    Point of View
    
    Thus far we have looked at how to begin and end essays and
    how to help readers follow the flow of thought. It remains to
    consider several other aspects of a composition, more abstract
    but no less important. These are point of view, persona, and
    tone.
  - |-
    Point of view relates to how you present a subject. Two approaches are possible. In a personal point of view you play the role of writer openly, using "I," "me," "my." An impersonal point of view, on the other hand, requires that you avoid all explicit reference to yourself. The difference is not that in a personal point of view the subject is the writer, while in an impersonal one it is something else. Every subject involves, though it is not necessarily the writer. The difference is a question of strategy.
    
    On many occasions one point of view or the other is preferable. Some topics so intimately involve the writer that they require a personal perspective. It would sound silly to describe your summer vacation impersonally. Don't be afraid to use "I" if it fits your subject and purpose.
    
    On other occasions a personal point of view is not appropriate. A scientist, writing professionally, usually tries to keep his or her personality below the surface, and properly so: scientific subjects are best treated objectively.
    
    Of course many topics can be presented from either point of view, though the two approaches will result in different essays. In such cases you must consider occasion and reader and the degree of formality you want. An impersonal point of view seems more formal, a personal one less so.
    
    Whichever you select, establish it in the opening paragraph. You needn't say, "My point of view will be personal [or impersonal]." Simply use "I" if you intend to write personally, or avoid it if you do not. (Such substitutes for "I" as "this observer," "your reporter," or "the writer" are wordy and awkward and best avoided.)

    Maintain point of view consistently. Don't jump back and forth between a personal and an impersonal presentation. At the same time, you can make small adjustments. For example, you may expand "I" to "we" when you wish to imply "I the writer and you the reader." Whether writing personally or impersonally you may address readers as individuals by employing "you," or shift to "one," "anyone," "people," and so on, when you are referring to no one specifically.
    
    But such shifts in point of view should be compatible with the emphasis you desire, and they should be slight. Radical changes, nine times in ten, are awkward. It is good practice, then, (1) to select a point of view appropriate to your subject, (2) to establish that point of view in the opening paragraph, and (3) to maintain it consistently.
    
    Persona
    
    Persona derives from the Latin word for an actor's mask (in the Greek and Roman theaters actors wore cork masks carved to represent the type of character they were playing). As a term in composition, persona means the writer's presence in the writing.
    
    The derivation from "mask" may be misleading. It does not imply a false face, a disguise, behind which the real individual hides. A writer's persona is always "real." It is there, in the prose. The words you choose, the sentence patterns into which you arrange them, even the kinds of paragraphs you write and how you organize your essay, suggest a personality, which is, for that particular piece of writing, you.
    
    But, you may object, a persona is not really the person who writes. (Rersoxingly enough, comes from the same Latin word.) Of course, that is true, and it is true that the same writer may assume different personas on different occasions. Still, the only contact readers generally have with a writer is through his or her words. For readers the persona implicit in those words is the real, existential fact about the writer.
  - |-
    The question to ask about any persona is not, "Is this really the writer?" The questions are, "Is it really how the writer wants to appear?" And, "Is it how he or she can best appear?" To put the matter another way: Is the persona authentic and appropriate?
    
    Authenticity means that the personality readers sense in your words is the personality you want them to perceive. To say that a persona is authentic does not necessarily mean that it is really you. We are all many different people, showing one face to friends, another to strangers, still another to the boss. Here authenticity simply means that how you appear in what you write is how you wish to appear.
    
    But authenticity is not enough. A persona must also be appropriate, efficacious in the sense that it achieves your ends. At the very least it ought not to get in the way.
    
    Persona is most immediately and directly revealed when a writer discusses himself or herself. For instance, a clear personality emerges in the following passage from Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography. Franklin is explaining that when he educated himself as a youth he learned to drop his habit of "abrupt contradiction, and positive argumentation" and to become more diffident in putting forward his opinions. (He is, of course, talking about the same thing we are—persona.)
  - |-
    [I retained] the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest diffi-
    dence, never using when &dvance any thing that may possibly be
    disputed, the words, certainly, undoubtedly, or any others that give
    the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather Bay, / conceive, or
    / apprehend a thing to be so or so, appears to me, or / should
    think it so for such & such reasons, or / imagine it to be so, or it is
    so iffam not mistaken. This habit | believe has been of great ad-
    vantage to me, when have had occasion to inculcate my opinions
    & persuade men into measures that 1 have been from time to time
    engag'd in promoting. And as the chief ends of conversation are to
    inform, or to be informed, to please or to persuade, Wish well
    meaning sensible men would not lessen their power of doing good
    by a positive assuming manner that seldom fails to disgust, tends
    to create opposition, and to defeat every one of those purposes for
    which speech was given us, to wit, giving or receiving information,
    or pleasure: for if you would inform, a positive dogmatical manner
    in advancing your sentiments, may provoke contradiction & prevent
    a candid attention. you wish information & improvement from
    the knowledge of others and yet at the same time express your self
    as firmly fix'd in your present opinions, modest sensible men, who
    do not love disputation, will probably leave you undisturb'd in the
    possession of your error; and by such a manner you can seldom
    hope to recommend yourself in pleasing your hearers, or to per-
    suade those whose concurrence you desire.
    
    Franklin strikes us as a discerning and candid man, sensitive
    to how he affects people, but sensitive in an unabashedly ego-
    centric way. His advice about not coming on too strong—
    still worth hesedngetiso much on concern for
    others as on a clear-eyed awareness that modesty is the way
    to get on in the world. Yet the very openness and ease with
    which Franklin urges that advice washes away its taint of self-
    serving manipulation.
    
    We sense a different personality in these paragraphs from
    Bertrand Russell's Autobiography:
  - |-
    Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed  
    my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and  
    unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like  
    great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward  
    course, over a deep ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge  
    of despair.
    
    I have sought love, first, because it brings satisfaction—ecstasy  
    great that would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few  
    hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness—  
    the pining and anguish in which one shivering consciousness  
    looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless  
    abyss. I have sought it, finally, because in the union of love have  
    seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven  
    that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I long for, and  
    though it might seem too good for human life, this is what—at  
    least—founds.
    
    With equal passion have I sought knowledge. I have wished to  
    understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars  
    shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which  
    number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, have  
    achieved.
    
    Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward  
    toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth.  
    Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine,  
    victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden  
    to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain  
    make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate  
    the evil, but cannot, and to suffer.
    
    This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would  
    gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.

    Russell is more emotional than Franklin. His attitude toward knowledge and toward other people is less self-serving and more passionate. He is driven to knowledge not because it serves his ambition but because of a compulsive desire to know (though Franklin too could show a disinterested quest for knowledge). Russell sees other people not as helps or hindrances to his career, but as fellow humans, for whose suffering he can feel compassion and sorrow.
    
    Yet there is more to Russell's persona than the obvious emotionalism. His feelings are constrained within a rational framework. The organization of his paragraphs is tightly analytical, and the whole passage can easily be reduced to an outline. Here is someone who not only feels intensely but whose intellect imposes order upon emotions, giving them a sharper focus. We sense a powerful, complex mind, in which emotion and reason are not at war but are reinforcing allies. Russell's passionate response to life gains intensity because it is shaped by reason.
    
    Persona, as you can see, is a function of the total composition. It emerges not only from the meanings of words but also from the more abstract, less obviously expressive patterns of sentences and paragraphs and from overall organization.
    
    While most obvious in autobiographies, persona is not confined to such writing. It exists in all compositions. Even when a writer uses an impersonal point of view, avoiding "I," "me," "my," we sense a personality. In the following passage a historian is discussing dress and personal cleanliness in the Middle Ages:
    
    Hemp was much used as a substitute for flax in making linen; the thought of hemp curdles the blood.
    
    In the thirteenth century, Sir Giles, beside the fire, removes all his clothes to scratch himself. (Fleas, no doubt.) Morris Bishop
    
    Such comments reveal writers as personalities, with their own ways of looking at the bizarre with a pleas-antly cynical humor.
    
    Even in relatively faceless writing there exists a persona. Here is Charles Darwin describing the mouth of a duck:
  - |-
    The beak of the shoveller-duck (Spatula clypeata) is a more beautiful and complex structure than the mouth of a whale. The upper mandible is furnished on each side (in the specimen examined by me) with a row or comb formed of 188 thin, elastic lamellae, obliquely bevelled so as to be pointed, and placed transversely to the longer axis of the mouth.
    
    80 THE ESSAY
    
    Darwin's is an observant, precise mind. He refrains from saying more than facts allow: notice the qualification "(in the specimen examined by me)." Although he does allow emotion occasionally to show (a stereotype), Darwin's tone is essentially sober, objective, painstaking, which, for his purpose, is exactly what it should be.
    
    Tone
    
    If persona is the complex personality implicit in the writing, tone is a web of feelings stretched throughout an essay, feelings from which our sense of the persona emerges. Tone has three main strands: the writer's attitude toward subject, reader, and self.
    
    Each of these determinants of tone is important, and each has many variations. Writers may be angry about a subject or amused by it or discuss it dispassionately. They may treat readers as intellectual inferiors to be lectured (usually a poor tactic) or as friends with whom they are talking. Themselves they may regard very seriously or with an ironic or an amused detachment (to suggest only three of numerous possibilities). Given all these variables, the possibilities of tone are almost endless.
    
    Tone, like persona, is unavoidable. You imply it in the words you select and in how you arrange them. It behooves you, then, to create an appropriate tone and to avoid those—pomposity, say, or flippancy—which offend.
    
    Here are a few examples of how skillful writers make tone work for them.
    
    Tone Toward Subject
    
    Toward most subjects many attitudes are possible. Often tone is simple objectivity, as in these two paragraphs:
  - |-
    Physical science is that department of knowledge which relates to
    the order of nature, or, in other words, to the regular succession of
    events.
    
    POINT OF VIEW, PERSONA, AND TONE 81
    
    The name of physical science, however, is often applied in a
    more or less restricted manner to those branches of science in
    which the phenomena considered are of the simplest and most ab-
    stract kind, excluding the consideration of the more complex phe-
    nomena, such as those observed in living beings.
    
    James Clerk Maxwell
    
    Maxwell's purpose is to define physical science, not to express
    his feelings about it. His language, accordingly, is denotative
    and his tone objective and unemotional.
    
    The writer of the following paragraph, on the other hand,
    is angry:
    
    The Exorcist is a menace, the most shocking major movie have
    ever seen. Never before have witnessed such a flagrant combi-
    nation of perverse sex, brutal violence, and abused religion. In ad-
    dition, the film degrades the medical profession and psychiatry. At
    the showing went to, the unruly audience giggled, talked, and
    yelled throughout. As well they might. Although the picture is not
    X-rated, it is so pornographic that it makes Last Tango in Paris seem
    like a Strauss waltz. Ralph R. Mrdenson,
    
    And in this example an angry tone is expressed more subtly,
    beneath a surface of irony. The writer is describing the efforts
    of nineteenth-century laborers to improve their working
    conditions:
    
    [A]s early as June 8, th®4Zhartists had pushed through a fac-
    
    tory law restricting working time for women and juveniles to eleven
    hours, and from May 1, 1848 to ten hours. This was not at all to
    the liking of the manufacturers, who were worried about their
    young people's morals and exposure to vice; instead of being im-
    mured for a whole twelve hours in the cozy, clean, moral atmo-
    sphere of the factories, they were now to be loosed an hour earlier
    into the hard, cold, frivolous outer world. Fritz JRackeiz
    
    Tone Toward Reader
    
    You may think of your readers in widely different ways.
    Some writers tend to be assertive and dogmatic, treating
  - |-

    readers as a passive herd to be instructed. The playwright and
    social critic George Bernard Shaw attacks the evils of capi-
    talism in such a manner:
    
    Just as Parliament and the Courts are captured by the rich, so is the
    Church. The average parson does not teach honesty and equality
    in the village school: he teaches deference to the merely rich, and
    calls that loyalty and religion.
    
    At the other extreme a writer may establish a more intimate
    face-to-face tone, as though talking to a friend. In the follow-
    ing case Ingrid Bengis is discussing the problem of being the
    "other woman" in a married man's life, of having to share
    him with his wife:
    
    One or the other of you is going to spend the night with him, the
    weekend with him, Christmas with him. (I've tried all three of us
    spending it together. Doesn't work.) One or the other of you is going
    to go on trips with him.
    
    Bengis' informal, conversational tone depends on several
    things. For one, she addresses her readers directly, acknowl-
    edging their presence and bringing them and herself into a
    more intimate, and seemingly more equal, relationship. For
    another, she cultivates a colloquial style, one suggesting the
    voice of a friend: the contractions ("I've," "Doesn't") and the
    terse fragment ("Doesn't work").
    
    A friendly informal tone need not be restricted to com-
    monplace subjects. In much contemporary exposition, even
    of a scholarly sort, writers often relax the older convention
    of maintaining a formal distance between themselves and their
    audience. Here, for instance, is a well-known scholar writing
    about Shakespeare:
    
    Great plays, as we know, do present us with something that can be
    called a world, a woctddiwretraown in being made
    of people, actions, situations, thoughts, feelings, and much more,
    POINT OF VIEW, PERSONA, AND TONE 83
    
    but unlike our own in being perfectly, or almost perfectly, significant
    and coherent. Maynard Mack
    
    While certainly not as colloquial as Ingrid Bengis, Mack ac-
    knowledges his readers ("As we know") and subtly flatters
    their intelligence and sophistication.

    Writers working for the illusion of a talking voice sometimes use italics to suggest the loudness and pitch by which we draw attention to important words. The historian Barbara Tuchman does this effectively in the following passage (she is arguing that freedom of speech does not require that we accept any and all pornography):
    
    The cause of pornography is not the same as the cause of free speech. There is a difference. Ralph Ginsburg is not Theodore Dreiser and this is not the 1920s.
    
    Used sparingly, in that way, italics help to suggest a voice with which readers can connect. But note the caution: sparingly. Italics used for emphasis can easily become a mannerism, and then an annoyance.
    
    Tone Toward Self
    
    Toward himself or herself a writer can adopt an equally great variety of tones. Objective, impersonal exposition involves a negative presentation of the writer, so to speak. By avoiding personal references or idiosyncratic comments, he or she becomes a transparency through which we observe facts or ideas. A British writer discussing the Battle of Anzio in Italy during World War II begins like this:
    
    The full story of Anzio, which was originally conceived as a minor landing behind enemy lines but evolved through many ups and downs into a separate Italian front of major importance, needs a history to itself. Within the scope of the present work it is possible only to summarize the main events and their significance in so far as they affected the main front at Cassino. Fred Majdalany
    
    On the other hand, writers may be more self-conscious and deliberately play a role. In exposition it is often a good tactic to present yourself a bit deferentially, as Benjamin Franklin suggests in the passage quoted earlier. An occasional "it seems to me" or "I think" or "to my mind" goes a long way toward avoiding a tone of cocksureness and restoring at least a semblance of two-way talk unavoidably one-way street from writer to reader. Thus a scholar writing about Chaucer's love poetry escapes dogmatism by a qualifying phrase:
  - |-
    Early love complaints are less conventional than most and have  
    the unmistakable ring, or so it seems to me, of serious attempts at  
    persuasion. John Gardner  
    
    A writer's exploitation of a self-image may go considerably  
    beyond an occasional "I think." Humorous writers, for ex-  
    ample, often present themselves as ridiculous.  
    
    Every so often, when business slackens up in the bowling alley and  
    the other pin boys are hunched over their game of bezique, fike  
    
    to exchange my sweatshirt for a crisp white surgical tunic, polish  
    up my optical mirror, and examine the corset advertisements in the  
    New York Herald Tribune rotogravure section and the various  
    women's magazines. It must be made clear at the outset that my  
    motives are the purest and my curiosity that of the scientific re-  
    search worker rather than the sex maniac. S.J. Perelman  
    
    Such role-playing is not quite the same as a persona. A  
    writer's persona is reflected in all aspects of a composition,  
    not simply in a deMigartcaourmuse us or in the  
    
    guise of a deferential friend hoping to charm us. Beyond any  
    momentary character the writer may be playing is the creator  
    of that role. It is that creator, that total intelligence and sen-  
    sibility, which constitutes the persona.

    CHAPTER  
    
    Basic Structure  
    
    Expository paragraphs deal with facts, ideas, beliefs. They ex-  
    plain, analyze, defnpare, illustrate. They answer ques-  
    tions like What? Why? How? What was the cause? The ef-  
    fect? Like what? Unlike what? They are the kinds of  
    paragraph we write in reports or term papers or tests.  
    
    The term paragraph has no simple definition. Occasionally  
    a single sentence or even a word may serve as an emphatic  
    paragraph. Conventionally in composition, however, a para-  
    graph is a group of sentences developing a common idea,  
    called the topic.
  - |-
    An expository paragraph is essentially an enlargement of a subject/predicate pattern like "Dogs bark." But the subject is more complicated and needs to be expressed in a clause or sentence, called the topic statement, which is usually placed at or near the beginning. The predicates—asserted about the special sequence—these constitute the body of the paragraph, developing or supporting the topic in any of several ways, ways we shall study in subsequent chapters.
    
    No one can say how long a paragraph should be. Subject, purpose, audience, editorial fashion, and individual preference, all affect the length and complexity of paragraphs. As a rough rule of thumb, however, you might think of expository paragraphs in terms of 120 or 150 words. If most of your paragraphs fall below 100 words, say—they are they need more development. If your paragraphs run consistently to 200 or 300 words, they are probably too long and need to be shortened or divided. Numerous brief paragraphs are liable to be disjointed and underdeveloped. Great long ones fatigue readers. But neither is a very broad average. An occasional short paragraph of 15 to 20 words may work very well; so may an occasional long one of 300.
    
    The Topic Sentence
    
    A good topic sentence is concise and emphatic. It is no longer than the idea requires, and it stresses the important word or phrase. Here, for instance, is the topic statement which opens a paragraph about the collapse of the stock market in 1929:
    
    The Big Bull Market was dead. Frederick Lewis Allen
  - |-
    Notice several things. (1) Allen's sentence is brief. Not all topics can be explained in six words, but whether they take six or sixty, they should be phrased in no more words than are absolutely necessary. (2) The sentence is clear and strong: you understand exactly what AHams. (3) It places the key thomhd,‘(deart guts heavy stress and leads naturally into what will follow. Of course, if a topic sentence ends on a key term, it must do so naturally, without violating any rules of word order or idiom. (4) The sentence stands farshe paragraph. This is where topic statements generally belong: at or near the beginning.
    
    To attract attention, topic sentences sometimes appear in the form of rhetorical questions:
    
    What then is the modern view of Joan's voices and messages from God? George Bernard Shaw
    
    What did Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation accomplish? J. G. Randall
    
    Rhetorical questions are easy ways of generating paragraphs. Perhaps too easy; so use them with restraint. Once is probably enough in a short piece of writing.
    
    Another eye-catching form of topic statement is the fragment, the grammatically incomplete sentence, as in the second paragraph of this passage (italics added):
    
    Approaching the lake from the south, spread out, high up in a great V, was a flock of Canada geese. They did not land but continued on their way, trailed by the brass notes of their honking.
    
    Spring. How perfect its fanfare. No trumpets or drums could ever have so triumphantly announced the presence of royalty. Stood marveling in their wake until, cold, teturned to the firs to see what else Could usummon Ruth Rudner
    
    But fragments, too, are effective only if they are used with restraint. Most of the time the best topic statement is a strong, clear, grammatically complete, declarative sentence.
    
    Sentences as the Analytic Elements of a Paragraph
    
    The sentences of a good expository paragraph reflect a clear, rational analysis of the topic. Here is a brief example, this one by Bertrand Russell. (The sentences have been numbered for convenience.)
  - |-
    [1] The intellectual life of the nineteenth century was more com-
    plex than that of any previous age. [2] This was due to several
    causes. [3] First: the area concerned was larger than ever before;
    America and Russia made important contributions, and Europe be-
    came more aware than formerly of Indian philosophies, both an-
    cient and modern. [4] Second: science, which had been a chief
    source of novelty since the seventeenth century, made new con-
    quests, especially in geology, biology, and organic chemistry.
    92 THE EXPOSITORY PARAGRAPH
    
    [5] Third: machine production profoundly altered the social struc-
    ture, and gave men a new conception of their powers in relation
    to the physical environment. [6] Fourth: a profound revolt, both
    philosophical and political, against traditional systems of thought,
    in politics and in economics, gave rise to attacks upon many beliefs
    and institutions that had hitherto been regarded as unassailable.
    [7] This revolt had two very different forms, one romantic, the other
    rationalistic. [8] (I am using these words in a liberal sense.) [9] The
    romantic revolt passes from Byron, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche
    to Mussolini and Hitler; the rationalistic revolt begins with the
    French philosophers of the Revolution, passes on, somewhat soft-
    ened, to the philosophical radicals in England, then acquires a
    deeper form in Marx and issues in Soviet Russia.
    
    Russell's nine sentences correspond to his steps in analyz-
    ing his topic:
    
    Sentence Idea
    
    Topic: increasing intellectual complexity
    Plan: list several causes
    First cause: larger area
    Second cause: science

    Examining whether the sentences of a paragraph corre-
    spond with its ideas is a good test of the coherence of the
    paragraph. The correspondence need not be as exact as in
    Russell's paragraph (and usually will not be). But if you can-
    not outline a generally clear relationship, the paragraph is
    probably confused and confusing.
  - |-
    The fact that a paragraph like Russell's reveals a coherent logical structure does not imply that the writer worked from an outline. One can proceed in this way, but in writing of any length an outline is tedious and time-consuming. Experienced writers adjust sentences to thought intuitively, without constantly thinking about when to begin a new sentence. Those with less experience must remain more conscious of the problem. Working up paragraphs from outlines provides good practice. But whether it is consciously thought out or intuitive, a well-made paragraph uses sentences to analyze the subject.
    
    For Practice
    
    [> Selecting one of the general subjects listed below, compose ten topic sentences, each on a different aspect of the subject, with an eye to developing a paragraph of about 150 words. Aim at clarity, emphasis, concision. Experiment with placing key words at the end of the sentence and with one or two rhetorical questions and fragments.

[2] On the one hand it is felt to be the dullest and driest of academic subjects, fit only for those in whose veins the red blood of life has long since turned to ink. [3] On the other, it is a subject upon which people who would scorn to be professional grammarians hold very dogmatic opinions, which they will defend with considerable emotion.
    [4] Much of this prejudice stems from the usual sources of prejudice. [5] Even highly educated people seldom have a clear idea of what grammarians do, and there is an unfortunate confusion about the meaning of the term "grammar" itself. W. Nelson Francis

    Paragraph unity involves two related but distinct concepts:
    coherence and flow. Coherence means that the ideas fit together. Flow means that the sentences link up so that readers are not conscious of gaps. Flow is a matter of style and exists in specific words and grammatical patterns tying one sentence to another. Coherence belongs to the substructure of the paragraph, to relationships of thought, feeling, and perception. Both are necessary if a paragraph is to be truly unified.
    
    Coherence
    
    To be coherent a paragraph must satisfy two criteria: First, relevance to the topic. Second, effective ordering be arranged in a way that clarifies their
    logic or their importance. There is, in addition, a negative criterion of irrelevance, be omitted.
    
    Relevance
    
    A topic sentence makes a promise that the paragraph must fulfill. Do not wander from the topic. No matter how attractive an idea may seem, let it go if you cannot fit it into the
    topic you have staked out or cannot revise the topic to include it. Here is an example of a paragraph marred by irrelevance:
    
    [1] College is very different from high school. [2] The professors
    talk a great deal more and give longer homework assignments.
    [3] This interferes with your social life. [4] It may even cost you
    your girlfriend. [5] Girls don't like to be told that you have to stay
    home and study when they want to go to a show or go dancing.
    [6] So they find some other boy who doesn't have to study all the
    time. [7] Another way college is different is the examinations. . .
  - |-
    The paragraph begins well. The first sentence establishes the topic and the second supports it. Then the writer begins to slide away. Sentences 3 and 4 might be allowed if they were subordinated. But 5 and 6 lose contact. True, some people do not like to take second place to homework, but that is not pertinent here. In sentence 7 the writer tacitly acknowledges that he has wandered, throwing out a long transitional lifeline to haul us back to the topic. Rid of irrelevance, the paragraph might read:
    
    College is very different from high school. The professors talk a great deal more and give longer homework assignments, which interfere with your social life. College examinations, too, are different... .
    
    Order of Thought
    
    Relevance alone is not enough to establish coherence. All the ideas in a paragraph can relate to the topic yet be poorly arranged.
    
    Arrangement often inheres in the subject itself. A paragraph about baking a cake or preparing to water-ski is committed to following the steps of the process it describes. Telling a story, you must follow a certain sequence of events. And in some subjects there is a logical structure implicit in the subject that determines order of thought, as in this example about the value of opposition in politics:
    
    The opposition is indispensable. A good statesman, like any other sensible human being, always learns more from his opponents than from his fervent supporters. For his supporters will push him to disaster unless his opponents show him where the dangers are. So if he is wise he will often pray to be delivered from his friends, because they will ruin him. But, though it hurts, he ought also to pray never to be left without opponents; for they keep him on the path of reason and good sense. Walter Ligomann
    
    There is a necessary order of thought here: first assertion, next a reason supporting it, and then a conclusion, introduced by "so."
  - |-
    There are times, however, when the order of thought is less a function of the subject itself than of the writer's view of it. For instance, if you were writing about the three things that most surprised you the first time you visited, say, New York City, you might not find any logical or temporal relationship between those things.
    
    One solution in such cases is to arrange ideas in order of relative importance, either climactically, placing the most important last, or anticlimactically, putting it first. If you cannot discern any shadings of importance, consider which order best connects with what has gone before or with what will come next. Should you find no basis whatever for arranging the ideas within a paragraph, then, of course, any order is legitimate. But this is not likely to happen often. Most of the time a proper or at least a most effective way of sequencing ideas does exist.
    
    Paragraph Flow
    
    Flow, those visible links which bind the sentences of a paragraph, can be established in two basic ways. (They are compatible; a paragraph may employ both.) The first is to establish a master plan at the beginning of the paragraph and to introduce each new idea by a word or phrase that marks its place in the plan. The second concentrates on linking sentences successively as the paragraph develops, making sure that each statement connects with the one or ones preceding it.
    
    Setting Up a Master Plan
    
    The opening sentence makes clear, not only the topic, but also how it will be analyzed and developed:
    
    There are three kinds of book owners. The first has a standard set and best readers—(Unless the individual owns wood pulp and ink, not books.) The second has a great many books that he has read through, most of them dipped into, but all of them as clean and shiny as the day they were bought. (This person would probably like to make books his own, but is restrained by a false respect for their physical appearance.) The third has a few books or many that are very dog-eared and dilapidated, shaken and loosened by continual use, marked and scribbled in from front to back. (This man owns books.)
    
    Mortimer Adler
  - |-
    Aedity on indicates his plan ("three kinds") and introduces each aspect of the topic with the appropriate term:
    "First," "second," "third." Sometimes, instead of words,
    numbers or letters introduce the parts of a paragraph:
    
    For the majority of situations in which a dictionary is consulted for
    meaning, words may be roughly divided into three groups: Hard
    
    words which circumstances make immediately important: "The
    doctor prescribed synthesized cortisone." "Recidivism is a serious
    criminal problem in some urban communities." "Existentialism is
    a subjective philosophy." (2) Words frequently seen, usually un-
    derstood loosely, but suddenly and recurrently unstable (for the in-
    dividual): synthesize, urban and subjective in the preceding sen-
    PARAGRAPH UNITY 99
    
    téB)c&ommon familiar words which unexpectedly need to be
    
    differentiated (break vs. tear, shrubvs. bush) or specifically clarified,
    such as fable, adventure, shake, door, remainder, evil. Most people
    get by without having to clarify these common words in the third
    group until they become an issue. Without an issue definitions of
    these common words are frequently jumped on because the word
    looks easy to the uninitiated, although in practice they are usually
    more difficult than hard words to define. Philip B. Gove
    
    Numbering the parts of a pathgwapls—whether
    or with figures—is simple and clear. But it suits only topics
    which can be easily broken into parts. Moreover, it can seem
    mechanical and, overused, prove confusing. In a short essay
    one paragraph using this method of flow is enough.
    
    The obviousness of "first," "second," "third" can be
    avoided by introducing key terms right in the topic sentence
    to label the particular parts of the subject, and repeating those
    terms as each aspect is brought forward in the body of the
    paragraph (italics are added):

    We are controlled here by our confusion, far more than we know,
    and the American dream has therefore become something much
    more closely resembling a nightmare, on the private, domestic, and
    international levels. Privately, we cannot stand our lives and dare
    not examine them; domestically, we take no responsibility for (and
    no pride in) what goes on in our country; and, internationally, for
    many millions of people we are an unmitigated disaster.
    
    James Baldwin
    
    One way of creating flow, then, is to announce your plan
    and explicitly fit each unit into that plan. It is not a method
    confined to single paragraphs. You can use it to organize a
    portion of a long paragraph (which is what Baldwin does), or
    expand it to organize a short theme, in which case the units
    would be individual paragraphs rather than sentences. But it
    is, as we said, a mechanical mode of organization to be em-
    ployed with restraint.
    100 THE EXPOSITORY PARAGRAPH
    
    Linking Successive Sentences
    
    The second way of maintaining flow is to connect sentences
    
    as you go. Less obvious than "first," "second," "third," this
    
    means of achieving flow seems more natural. And it can ac-
    
    commodate more complex relationships among ideas; it is not
    
    confined to topics that can be broken into a numbered series.
    Sentences can be linked in several ways.
    
    [> Repeating Key Words
    
    Verbal repetition is the most obvious link. Sometimes the
    identical word is repeated in a paragraph which
    
    follows on Saint Patiraok-ferometifntise
    
    same word, and sometimes synonymous terms:
    
    We know that among the marks of holiness is the working of mir-
    acles. Ireland is the greatest miracle any saint ever worked. It is a
    miracle and a nexus of miracles. Among other miracles it is a nation
    raised from the dead. Hilaire Belloc
    
    The repeated words may occur in a variety of positions. Of
    these the most useful are the beginnings of successive sen-
    tences, the endings of such sentences, and the close of one
    sentence and the opening of the one immediately following
    (the italics are added in the following examples):
    
    No man of note was ever further separated from life and fact than

    Thurman Arnold
    
    PARAGRAPH UNITY
    
    A special case of synonymous repetition involves pronouns
    and demonstratives such as one, another, some, the former,
    the latter, the first, the second, the third, and so on. These
    words link sentences by substituting for an earlier word or
    phrase. This and that (along with their plurals these and those)
    are especially useful in this way and may be employed either
    as pronouns or as adjectives (italics are added):
    
    The blind in particular seem to become indifferent to climatic ex-
    tremes; and there must be in everyone's cognizance two or three
    immovable sightless mendicants defying rain and chill... .
    
    This insensitiveness to January blasts and February drenchings
    may be one of the compensations that the blind enjoy. Whatever
    else happens to them they never, perhaps, catch cold. And that is
    more than something. E. v. Lucas
    
    There is a danger, however, in using this or that as subjects.
    A connection clear to the writer does not always jump at the
    reader. The risk increases when the antecedent of the this or
    that is not a single word but a group of words, even a complex
    idea stretched over several sentences. It is sometimes better
    to use these words not as nouns but as adjectives modifying
    a more precise subject. The sentence sums up the pre-
    ceding point, as Lucas does with "this insensitiveness." As an
    adjective the this still hooks the new sentence to what has
    preceded it, but with less risk of confusion.
    
    [> Conjunctive Adverbs
    Sentences can also be linked by conjunctive (also called tran-
    sitional) adverbs, which indicate relationships between ideas.
    The relationship may be one of time (presently, meanwhile,
    afterwards, above, below, in front); or of logic
    (therefore, however, as a result).
  - |-
    The following example shows how critic F. L. Lucas creates flow by transitional words (here italicized) in a passage answering the claim that metaphor has no place in prose:
    
    Io2 THE EXPOSITORY PARAGRAPH
    
    The truth seems that metaphor too is older than any literature—an immemorial human impulse perhaps as much utilitarian as literary.
    For there appears little ground for assigning poetic motives to the first man who called the hole in a needle its "eye," or the projections on a saw its "teeth." /n fine, metaphor is an inveterate human tendency, as ancient perhaps as the days of the mammoth, yet vigorous still in the days of the helicopter. Why then should it be banned from prose?
    
    "For.... In finehen" establish the logical framework of the argument:
    
    Assertion Sentence 1
    Reason "For," sentence 2
    Assertion restated "In fine," sentence 3
    Conclusion "then," sentence 4
    
    Transitional adverbs are best placed at or near the beginning of the sentence. Readers are like people groping down a dark passage, and an important part of the writer's task is to show them the way. Connective words are signal lights telling readers what to expect. However flashes, "Contradiction ahead"; in fact warns, "Here comes a strong restatement of something just said."; and therefore, &d&aclusion or a consequence is approaching."
    
    Acquiring a working set of conjunctive adverbs is not difficult. English is rich in them. Just to show some sort of contradiction or opposition, for example, we have but, however, still, yet, nonetheless, nevertheless, though, instead, on the other hand, on the contrary, notwithstanding, even so, and the list is not complete. While they show generally the same basic relationship, these words are not exact equivalents. They convey nuances of idea and tone. Nevertheless, for instance, is a more formal word than though. Because of such slight but important diffeeanoeg and tone, good writers have ready at hand a number of transitional adverbs. If you can call only upon but or however you cannot communicate what is implied by yet or still or though.

    And and but present a special case. Most often they act as
    conjunctive adverbs, joining words, phrases, or clauses within
    a sentence. But they can also function adverbially. Sometimes
    one hears the warning, "Never begin a sentence with and or
    bite' fact is that good writers do begin with these words
    (the italics are added):

    thasthermore or moreover or additionally. Don't be afraid
    of initial ands and huts. But use them moderately.
    
    I> Syntactic Patterning
    
    Syntactic patterning simply means repeating the same basic
    structure in successive or near successive sentences. It often
    holds together the parts of a comparison or contrast:

    the breadlines stretch endlessly along the dirty brick walls in windy

    It is common knowledge that millions of underprivileged families  
    want adequate food and housing. What is less commonly remarked  
    is that after they have adequate food and housing they want to  
    
    be served at a fine restaurant and to have a weekend cottage by  
    the sea. People want tickets to the Philharmonic and vacation trips  
    abroad. They want fine china and silver dinner sets and handsome  
    clothes. The illiterate want to learn how to read. Then they want  
    education, and then more education, and then they want their sons  
    and daughters to become doctors and lawyers. It is frightening to  
    see so many millions of people wanting so much. It is almost like  
    being present at the Oklahoma land rush, except that millions are  
    involved instead of hundreds, and instead of land, the prize is  
    everything that life has to offer. Samuel c. Florman
    
    While reusing the same sentence pattern often involves re-  
    peating some words, the similar grammatical structure is in  
    itself a strong connective device. However, you cannot im-  
    pose such syntactic patterning on just any group of sentences.  
    It works only when the underlying thought is repetitious, as  
    in the example above, where the sentences list a series of rising  
    expectations common to Americans. In such cases the simi-  
    larity of pattern does what ideally all sentence structure  
    should do: the form reinforces the sense.

    **CHAPTER**
    
    **Paragraph Development:**
    (1) Illustration and Restatement
    
    In this and the following several chapters we study how expository paragraphs develop. We focus on one technique of development at a time, beginning with the simplest ones, illustration and restatement. Of course, writers often combine techniques. But walking comes before running, and for the moment we concentrate on relatively uncomplicated paragraphs.
  - |-
    Methods of paragraph development fall into three loose groups: (1) those that stay strictly within the topic, offering examples of it or merely repeating it in the varying ways; (2) techniques involving another subject, either related or analogous; and (3) techniques that explore the ramifications of the topic more fully, its causes or effects.
    
    Illustration  
    Citing examples is an easy way to support a generalization:
    
    Some of those writers who most admired technology—Whitman, Henry Adams, and H. G. Wells, for an example—also greatly admired the power of technology. Samuel C. Florman
    
    (1) ILLUSTRATION AND RESTATEMENT 107
    
    But an effect can become a cause, reinforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an intensified form, and so indefinitely. A man may take to drink because he feels himself a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. George Orwell
    
    Illustrations show that you are not talking through your hat. Thus Florman gives us names, grounding his assertion in facts and enabling us to check that assertion against our own knowledge. Illustrations have a second virtue: they anchor an abstraction in particulars, translating difficult ideas into everyday terms. This is what Orwell does.
    
    Brief examples like those by Florman and Orwell do not make paragraphs, of course. But examples can be extended to provide the substance of an entire paragraph. Sometimes the paragraph consists of a single example worked out in detail:
  - |-
    Some of the most abstract terms in the language are really faded metaphors. On examination it turns out that an earlier meaning, now forgotten, is often lively in the extreme. Hence an obvious means of invigorating our jejune vocabulary is to fall back on those lively older meanings. True enough, the average speaker does not know that they ever existed. He is not reminded that "express" once meant, literally and physically, "to press out." But he can learn it instantaneously from a context. It may be that only the archaic literal sense is intended, or it may be that both the physical and the metaphorical are to be grasped simultaneously. In any event, the impact of the divergent use on an attentive reader forces him to a new experience of the word, without sacrificing comprehension. An example of the use of "express" in this revivified fashion will be found in Emily Dickinson:
    
    Essential Oil—are wrung—
    
    The Attar from the Rose
    
    Be not expressed by Suns—alone—
    
    lis the gift of Screws— Margaret Schlauch
    
    On the other hand a paragraph may consist of a number of brief examples, as in this passage about the change in modern modes of eating and drinking:
    
    108 THE EXPOSITORY PARAGRAPH
    
    As far as the home is concerned, the biggest change in what P. C. Wodehouse called "browsing and sluicing" is probably not the decline in huge, formal meals, or shorter menus, but the odd form our food is in nowadays when we buy it. Coffee comes as a powder. Fish arrives as a frozen rectangular block. Soup, stiff with preservatives, comes in a tin or as a powder. Potatoes no longer wear their jackets but arrive pale and naked in an impenetrable plastic bag. Embryonic mashed potato comes in little dry lumps, like cattle-feed pellets. Bread, untouched by human baker, arrives wrapped and sliced in a soft lump, the "crust" seemingly sprayed on. Beer, urged upward by gas, emerges from a steel dustbin. Frank Muir
    
    Whether you use one example or several, be sure your reader will take them for what they are. Often it is advisable explicitly to introduce an illustration by some such phrase as
  - |-
    Here is the text with all formatting errors fixed and content extracted verbatim:
    
    ---
    
    For example, for instance, as a case in point, or, a bit more subtly, say, thus, consider. Vary these expressions; do not introduce every illustration with "for example." Nor is it necessary always to place the phrase in the opening position. "For instance," "for example," is equally effective set between subject and verb, where it is still near the beginning but seems less mechanical.
    
    When the illustrative function of a detail is obvious, you can safely dispense with an introductory phrase. Orwell does not write, "For example, a man may take to drink ..."; nor does Muir label his instances of the oddity of modern food. They depend on the reader's common sense. No infallible rule tells you when "for example" is superfluous and when its absence will confuse a reader. You must try to imagine yourself in the reader's place. If an illustration seems even a bit bewildering without an introductory word or phrase, put one in.
    
    Introduced or not, examples are most effective when they are specific. In Muir's paragraph the abstract expression "‘the odd form our food is in' is given heft and shape by "frozen rectangular block," "pale and naked in an impenetrable plastic bag," "little dry lumps, like cattle-feed pellets."

    Primitive peoples often build much of their religious and cultural behavior on this belief in the natural relationship of word and thing. For example, they believe that to know the name of an object, person, or deity is to gain a certain control over it: in Balinese culture, for instance, the name of a god is often used in rituals to invoke his presence.

    Words are therefore tabooed, or euphemisms and descriptive
    phrases are invented such as the little people instead of fairies. The

    The Restatement Paragraph
    
    At its simplest, restatement involves nothing more than re-
    peating the main idea. It is common as a way of emphasizing
    something important:
    
    1964 threatens to be the most explosive year America has wit-
    nessed. The most explosive year. Malcolm x
    
    Sufficiently extended, restatement will provide the sub-
    stance of an entire paragraph, as in this passage about why
    American men are unlikely to cry (the paragraph expresses
    attitudes of our culture, not the writer's own beliefs):
    
    American men don't cry, because it is considered unmasculine to
    do so. Only sissies cry. Crying is a "weakness" characteristic of the
    female, and no American male wants to be identified with anything
    in the least weak or feminine. Crying, in our culture, is identified
    with childishness, with weakness and dependence. No one likes a
    crybaby, and we disapprove of crying even in children, discour-
    aging it in them as early as possible. In a land so devoted to the
    pursuit of happiness as ours, crying really is rather un-American.
    Adults must learn not to cry in situations in which it is permissible
    for a child to cry. Women being the "weaker" and "dependent"
    sex, it is only natural that they should cry in certain emotional
    situations. In women, crying is excusable. But in men, crying is a
    mark of weakness. So goes the American credo with regard to
    crying. Ashley Montagu

    Repeating what you have just said is both an easy and a  
    difficult way of developing a paragraph. Easy because you do  
    not have to search for examples or comparisons or causes.  
    Difficult because you must repeat a basic idea without being  
    monotonous. Because of this difficulty, restatement passages  
    are usually brief.
    
    The risk of monotony is increased by the similarity in sen-  
    tence structure common in restatement. Sentences that say the  
    same thing are often cast in the same mold. A good example  
    of such repeated structure appears in this passage about the  
    prevalence of piracy in the seventeenth century:
    
    It is difficult for one accustomed to the law and order of the present  
    day to understand the dangers which threatened the Jacobean trav-  
    eller. The seas swarmed with pirates; so that few merchantmen  
    dared to put to sea without arms; while very few came home with-  
    out some tale of an encounter. There were pirates in the Atlantic,  
    to intercept the ships coming home from the Newfoundland fish-  
    eries. There were pirates in the West Indies, roving for Spanish  
    treasure-ships. There were pirates in the Orkneys, preying upon the  
    Iceland trades. There were pirates near Ireland, especially in the  
    south and west, ranging over the Channel, and round these coasts.  
    But there were, perhaps, more pirates in the Mediterranean than in  
    all the other waters put together. time Mediterranean they had the  
    
    most part of the trade of Europe for their quarry; while the coasts  
    of Africa, and the islands of the [Greek] Archipelago, provided ob-  
    scure harbours (with compliant Governors) for the recruiting of  
    companies after a cruise. Jonn Masefield

  - |-
    Aside from knowing when to stop, success in handling re-
    statement depends on sufficiently varying the diction and sen-
    tence form. Masefield, for example, keeps the same pattern
    for four successive sentences: "There were pirates in" + a
    verbal phrase. But each sentence differs in its specific content
    (and hence in diction). At the same time the similarity of
    structure reinforces the point that piracy existed everywhere.
    Masefield also uses the repeated sentence structure to build
    toward his main topic—the Mediterranean. In a fifth
    "there were" sentence he signals the climactic significance of
    the Mediterranean by varying the pattern: opening with
    "But," placing "perhaps" in an interrupting position, and
    changing completely the second half of the sentence.
    
    Negative-Positive Restatement
    
    Negative-positive restatement begins by saying what is not
    the case, then asserts what is. (Sometimes the order is
    reversed.)
    
    I am not thinking of philosophy as courses in philosophy or even
    as a subject exclusive of other subjects. I am thinking of it in its old
    Greek sense, the sense in which Socrates thought of it, as the love
    and search for wisdom, the habit of pursuing an argument where it
    leads, the delight in understanding for its own sake, the passionate
    pursuit of dispassionate reasonableness, the will to see things stead-
    ily and altogether. Brand Blanshard
    
    Specification
    
    Another special type of restatement is specification, which
    moves from the general to the particular. Brief specifications
    are often found within single sentences as a means of giving
    substance to an abstraction (italics added):
    
    Bound to the production of staple crops—sugar—
    the soil suffered from erosion and neglect. Oscar Handlin
    
    112 THE EXPOSITORY PARAGRAPH
    
    A more extended instance occurs in this paragraph about pol-
    itics in Louisiana. The paragraph develops by specifying all
    that is included in the phrase "the same political pattern":
    
    Throughout the years the same political pattern prevailed. The city
    dominated the state: New Orleans, the nation's oldest
    city—still the political center of Louisiana.

    pots, smiling in not altogether Latin indifference at its moral deformities, and, like a cankered prostitute, covering those deformities with paint and lace and capitalizing upon them with a lewd beckoning to the stranger. Beyond New Orleans, in the south, French Louisiana, devoutly Catholic, easy-going, following complacently its backward-glancing patriarchs, suspicious of the Protestants to the north. And in central and northern Louisiana, the small farmers, principally Anglo-Saxon; bitter, fundamentalist Protestants, hating the city and all its evil works, leaderless in their disquiet and only vaguely aware that much of what they lacked was in some way coupled with the tteassbkkers whom they alternately voted into and out of public life. Hodding Carter
    
    While specification resembles illustration, it differs in an important way. An illustration is one of several possible cases. Specification covers all the cases. In the sentence above by Professor Handlin, "tobacco, cotton, rice, sugar" are not simply examples of the staple crops of southern agriculture; they are the staple crops. Similarly Hodding Carter, beginning with the abstract phrase "political pattern," specifies that pattern in its entirety, rather than citing one or two parts by way of example.

    Paragraph Development:
    (2) Comparison, Contrast,
    and Analogy
  - |-
    The methods of development we study in this chapter involve two subjects (occasionally more than two). Analogy is a special kind of comparison in which a subject of secondary importance and often of a quite different nature is introduced to clarify or justify some aspect of the main subject. Comparison treats two subjects of the same nature, as does contrast; but the former shows how the subjects are alike, while the latter focuses on how they differ. But despite this difference, comparison and contrast work in the same way, and we consider them together, putting off analogy until the end of the chapter.
    
    Comparison and Contrast
    Focusing
    
    Because they involve at least two subjects and offer several possibilities of emphasis, comparison and contrast pose problems of focus. For one thing, you must decide whether to deal only with similarities or only with dissimilarities, or to cover both. The topic sentence must make your intention clear to readers:
    
    (2) COMPARISON, CONTRAST, AND ANALOGY T1§
    
    The difference between a sign and a symbol is, in brief... .
    Susanne K. Langer
    
    It is a temptation to make a comparison between the nineteen twenties and the nineteen sixties, but the similarities are fewer than the differences. Russell Lynes
    
    Bears and dogs are alike in one intriguing way. Evelyn Jones
    
    A second decision of focusing concerns the subjects. Will you concentrate on one subject or treat both equally? If you are comparing (or contrasting), say, New York and Los Angeles, you have three possibilities of focus: New York, Los Angeles, or both. Make clear which it will be. But don't be heavy-handed; a topic sentence like "I shall focus here upon New York" is mechanical and obvious. Instead, construct the topic sentence so that the key idea functions as the subject word and thus naturally indicates your focus. If your chief concern is, say, New York:
    
    In many ways New York is like Los Angeles.
    If it is both places:
    In many ways New York and Los Angeles are alike.
  - |-
    In the following paragraph notice how the historian J. G. Randall keeps his focus constantly before us. (He is comparing the failure of Reconstruction after the Civil War and the refusal of the U.S. Senate to accept President Wilson's League of Nations policy after World War I. The italics have been added.)
    
    In the case of both Lincoln and Wilson the soldiers did their part and so did the Executive, but in each case partisanship and narrow-mindedness wrecked the program. Under Lincoln and Johnson, as under Wilson, there was failure of high-minded unity behind the plan of peace that bore promise of success. In each case, instead of needful co-operation, there was stupid deadlock between President and Congress. There was in each case a fateful congressional election whose effect was felt far down in later years: tayae matched against the "critical year" 18@&ch case the President's plan failed in the sense that it failed to be adopted; the opposite plan in each case failed miserably by being adopted.
    
    Organizing a Comparison or Contrast
    
    When you compare or contrast any two subjects, which we can call A and B, you do so with regard to specific points, which we'll call 1, 2, 3. Now you may proceed in two ways, organizing around A and B or around 1, 2, 3. Thus in contrasting New York and Los Angeles you might devote the first half of the paragraph (or an entire paragraph) to New York and the second half (or a new paragraph) to Los Angeles. In each section you would cover the same particular points and in the same olidearte;saylfural facilities,
    
    and nightlife. Conversely, you might prefer to make climate, cultural facilities, and nightlife the primary centers of your organization, devoting a paragraph or portion of a paragraph to each and discussing how the two cities differ.
  - |-
    Neither way of proceeding is necessarily better. Organizing around A and B stresses each subject in its totality. Organizing around 1, 2, and 3 emphasizes particular likenesses or differences. It all depends on what you want to do. In the following case the writer elected to organize around A and B: Eastern and Western civilizations and Americans and Western Europeans, in their sensitivity to lingering problems around them, tend to make science and progress their scapegoats. There is a belief that progress has precipitated widespread unhappiness, anxieties and other social and emotional problems. Science is viewed as a cold mechanical discipline having nothing to do with human warmth and the human spirit.
    
    But to many of us from the nonscientific East, science does not have such repugnant associations. We are not afraid of it, nor are we disappointed by it. We know all too painfully that our social and emotional problems festered long before the age of technology. To us, science is warm and reassuring. It promises hope. It is helping us at long last some control over our persecutory environments, alleviating age-old problems but also, and especially, problems of the spirit. F. M. Esfandary
    
    In the next example, on the other hand, a historian contrasting Catholics and Protestants in the sixteenth century organizes not around the broad categories of Roman and Reformer, but rather around the differences that set them at war:
  - |-
    The Catholic believed in the authority of the Church; the Reformer, in the authority of reason. Where the Church had spoken, the Catholic obeyed. His duty was to accept without question the laws which councils had decreed, which popes and bishops administered, and so far as in him lay to enforce in others the same submission to an outward rule which he regarded as divine. All shades of Protestants on the other hand agreed that authority might err; that Christ had left no visible representative, whom individually they were bound to obey; that religion was the operation of the Spirit on the mind and conscience; that the Bible was God's word, which each Christian was to read, and which with God's help and his natural intelligence he could not fail to understand. The Catholic left his Bible to the learned. The Protestant translated the Bible, and brought it to the door of every Christian family. The Catholic prayed in Latin, and whether he understood his words or repeated them as a form the effect was the same; for it was magical. The Protestant prayed with his mind as an act of faith in a language intelligible to him, or he could not pray at all. The Catholic bowed in awe before his wonder-working image, adored his relics, and gave his life into the guidance of his spiritual director. The Protestant tore open the machinery of the miracles, flung the bones and ragged garments into the fire, and treated priests as men like himself. The Catholic was intolerant upon principle; persecution was the corollary of his creed. The intolerance of the Protestant was in spite of his creed. In denying the right of the Church to define his own belief, he had forfeited the privilege of punishing the errors of those who chose to differ from him. James Anthony Froude

    Building the Comparison or Contrast
  - |-
    Closely related to the question of organization is a final problem: in what compositional units will the comparison be built out of paragraphs, portions of paragraphs, sentences, halves of sentences? Probably the simplest plan is to spend a paragraph, or several sentences within a paragraph, on one of the two subjects and a unit of roughly equal length on the other. This is what F. M. Esfandiary does in discussing the differences between Eastern and Western attitudes toward science.
    
    But you may also construct a comparison or contrast in pairs of sentences:
    
    The original Protestants had brought new passion into the ideal of the state as a religious society and they had set about to discipline this society more strictly than ever upon the pattern of the Bible. The later Protestants reversed a fundamental purpose and became the allies of individualism and the secular state.
    
    Herbert Butterfield
    
    Or both parts of the comparison may be held within a single sentence, the total effect being built up from a series of such sentences:
    
    At first glance the traditions of journalism and scholarship seem completely unlike: journalism so bustling, feverish, content with daily oblivion; the academic world so sheltered, deliberate, and hopeful of enduring products. It is true that both are concerned with ascertination and diffusion of truth. In journalism, however, the emphasis falls on a rapid diffusion of fact and idea; in academic work it falls on a prolonged, laborious ascertination.
    Aillevins
    
    How you build a comparison or contrast is related, of course, to how you organize it. Using two paragraphs (or two portions of a single paragraph) is better when you are organizing around A and B; than that each subject in its
    (2) COMPARISON, CONTRAST, AND ANALOGY 119
    
    entirety. Proceeding by balanced sentences or halves of sentences is better if you wish to focus on specific points of similarity or difference.

    Think carefully about what you want to accomplish and how
    you can best focus, organize, and work up the material. The
    problem is further complicated by the fact that none of the
    choices we have discussed is absolute. A paragraph is not re-
    stricted to comparing or contrasting: it can do both. It does
    not have to maintain only one focus: a skillful writer can shift.
    And extended comparisons and contrasts can, and do, vary
    their methods of building.
    
    For Practice
    
    > Study the following paragraph and consider these questions: (a)
    Is the writer comparing, contrasting, or doing both? (b) Which of
    the two subjects receives the focus? (c) How is the comparison or
    contrast organized and how is it built?
    
    Let's compare the U.S. to India, for example. We have 203 million
    people, whereas she has 540 million on much less land. But look
    at the impact of people on the land.
    
    The average Indian eats his daily few cups of rice (or perhaps
    wheat, whose production on American farms contributed to our
    one percent per year drain in quality of our active farmland), draws
    his bucket of water from the communal well and sleeps in a mud
    hut. In his daily rounds to gather cow dung to burn to cook his rice
    and warm his feet, his footsteps, along with those of millions of his
    countrymen, help bring about a slow deterioration of the ability of
    the land to support people. His contribution to the destruction of
    the land is minimal.
    
    An American, on the other hand, can be expected to destroy a
    piece of land on which he builds a home, garage and driveway.
    He will contribute his share to the 142 million tons of smoke and
    fumes, seven million junked cars, 20 million tons of paper, 48 bil-
    lion cans, and 26 billion bottles the overburdened environment
    must absorb each year. To run his air conditioner he will stripmine
    a Kentucky hillside, push the dirt and slate down into the stream,
    and burn coal in a power generator, whose smokestack contributes
    to a plume of smoke massive enough to cause cloud seeding and
    premature precipitation from Gulf winds which should be irrigating
    the wheat farms of Minnesota. Wayne H. Davis

    Yet despite these differences A and B are alike in several
    ways.
    
    Analogy
    
    Analogy is a special kind of comparison in which a second
    subject is introduced to explain or justify something about
    the main topic. Here the American writer Flannery
    
    O'Connor addresses a class in creative writing:
    
    I understand that this is a course called "How the Writer Writes,"
    and that each week you are exposed to a different writer who holds
    forth on the subject. The only parallel I can think of to this is having
    the zoo come to you, one animal at a time; and suspect that what
    you hear one week from the giraffe is contradicted next week by
    the baboon.
  - |-
    Analogies differ from straightforward comparisons in several ways. First, they are always focused on one topic, the analogical subject being secondary, serving to clarify or emphasize or persuade. Second, the analogical subject usually is of a different nature from the main subject, so different that most of us would not think the two at all similar. Comparison typically involves things of similar nature—such as Ford and Chevrolet, for example, or New Orleans and San Francisco, high school and college. Analogies, on the other hand, often find unexpected similarities in unlike things, such as a course in writing and a visit to the zoo.
    
    Analogy as Clarification
    
    In exposition the most common function of an analogy is to translate an abstract or difficult idea into more concrete or familiar terms. That is certainly one of the aims of O'Connor's analogy, as it is of this longer example, in which an astronomer explains the philosophy of science:
    
    Let us suppose that an ichthyologist is exploring the life of the ocean. He casts a net into the water and brings up a fishy assortment. Surveying his catch, he proceeds in the usual manner of a scientist to systematize what it reveals. He arrives at two generalizations:
    
    1. No sea-creature is less than two inches long.
    2. All sea-creatures have gills.
    
    These are both true of his catch, and he assumes tentatively that they will remain true however often he repeats it.
    
    In applying this analogy, the catch stands for the body of knowledge which constitutes physical science, and the net for the sensory and intellectual equipment which we use in obtaining it. The casting of the net corresponds to observation; for knowledge which has not been or could not be obtained by observation is not admitted into physical science.

    An onlooker may object that the first generalization is wrong.
    "There are plenty of sea-creatures under two inches long, only your
    net is not adapted to catch them." The ichthyologist dismisses this
    objection contemptuously. "Anything uncatchable by my net is ipso
    facto outside the scope of ichthyological knowledge, and is not part
    of the kingdom of fishes which has been defined as the theme of
    ichthyological knowledge. In short, what my net can't catch isn't
    fish." (First of all, you are really guessing, you are claiming a knowledge of the physical universe discov-
    ered in some other way than by the methods of physical science,
    and admittedly unverifiable by such methods. You are a meta-
    physician. Bah!" Sir Arthur Eddington
    
    Analogy as Persuasion
    
    As well as clarifying the unfamiliar, analogies often have con-
    siderable persuasive force. Before we look at an example,
    though, we need to distinguish between logical and rhetorical
    analogies. In logic, analogies are a special form of proof; we
    are not concerned with them here.
    
    Our interest is exclusively in rhetorical analogies, and rhetorical
    analogies never constitute logical proof. At best they
    are what has been called "a weak form of reasoning." They
    merely suggest that because A resembles B in certain respects,
    it also resembles it in others. But since the resemblance be-
    tween A and B is never total and exact, what is true of one
    cannot necessarily be applied to the other.
    
    For example, some political thinkers have used the "simi-
    larity" of a state to a ship to justify an authoritarian society.
    They argue that a ship can survive storms only when author-
    ity is completely in the hands of the captain, who rightfully
    demands unquestioning obedience. So, they conclude, a state
    can survive only if its citizens submit unhesitatingly to an
    absolute ruler. But, of course, ships and states are not iden-
    tical. What may be needed for safety at sea cannot be assumed
    to apply to good government on land. Such analogies which
    claim to "prove" unwarranted conclusions are called "false"
    or "unfair."
  - |-
    But even though they are not a form of logical proof, rhetorical analogies can be very persuasive. Consider this one used by Abraham Lincoln in a speech opposing the spread of slavery to territories outside the South:
    
    If I saw a venomous snake crawling in the road, any man would say might seize the nearest stick and kill it; but if found that snake in bed with my children, that would be another question. I might hurt the children more than the snake, and it might bite them. Much more, if found it in bed with my neighbor's children, and I had bound myself by a solemn compact not to meddle with his children under any circumstances, it would become me to let that particular mode of getting rid of the gentleman alone. But if there was a bed newly made up, to which the children were to be taken, and it was proposed to take a batch of young snakes and put them there with them, fake it no man would say there was any question how I ought to decide. That is just the case. The new territories are the newly made bed to which our children are to go, and it lies with the nation to say whether they shall have snakes mixed up with them or not. It does not seem as if there could be much hesitation what our policy should be.
    
    Lincoln's argument simply assumes that slavery—the "grake' ants does not prove it. But most of his
    
    audience would not have needed proof. The essential point is that slavery should not be allowed to spread beyond the
    South, and the analogy is a striking, forceful explanation of why not.

    ning marks," because they resembled the curved fissures lightning
    slices down the trunks of trees. The function of lightning marks is
    this: if the arrow fails to kill the game, blood from a deep wound
    will channel along the lightning mark, streak down the arrow shaft,
    and spatter to the ground, laying a trail dripped on broadleaves, on

    Cause
    
    One cannot write for very long without having to explain
    why something happened or why it is true or false. There are
    numerous strategies for developing causes or reasons.' The
    simplest is to ask the question "Why?" and then to supply
    the answer:
    
    If, then, the language of the original colonists was merely the En-
    glish of England, why does ours differ somewhat from theirs today?
    Three reasons can be offered.
  - |-
    First, the people of Great Britain in the seventeenth century spoke different local dialects. What we now consider to be standard English for England developed from the language of London and the near-by counties. But the settlers of America came not only from that region but also from many others. New England was settled largely from the eastern counties. Pennsylvania received a heavy immigration from the north of Ireland. English as it came to be spoken in New England and much of Pennsylvania thus naturally was not the same English that developed as the standard in England. For instance in what we consider typical British English of today,

    the final r has been lost. It is, however, partially preserved in General American, possibly because the Scotch-Irish of the eighteenth century preserved that sound, as they still do in Ireland.
    
    A second cause for the difference between the two countries lies in mere isolation. Language is always changing. When two groups of people speaking the same language are separated and remain in comparative isolation, change continues in the language of both groups, but naturally it does not continue in the same direction and at the same rate with both of them. The languages thus tend to become different.
    
    Third, the language in the United States has been subjected to various influences that have not affected the language in Great Brit-ain, the languages of other early colonists and of later immigrants. George Stewat
    
    Development by reasons may be more subtle. Instead of using a question-answer strategy and explicitly announcing reasons, a writer may leave the causal relationships implicit. The connection exists in the substructure of ideas but is not spelled out. In the following paragraph, for instance, only the "for" in the opening sentence makes the idea of causality explicit:
  - |-
    The cult of beauty in women, which we smile at as though it were one of the culture's harmless follies, is, in fact, an insanity, for it is posited on a false view of reality. Women are not more beautiful than men. The obligation to be beautiful is an artificial burden, imposed by men on women, that keeps both sexes clinging to childhood, the woman forced to remain a charming, dependent child, the man driven by his unconscious desire to be—like — infant—loved and taken care of simply for his beautiful self. Woman's mask of beauty is the face of a child, a oévelatiorgic sexual immaturity of both sexes in our culture. Una Stannard
    
    Ordering Reasons within the Paragraph
    
    Sometimes you will work with only a single reason, repeating or expanding it in various ways: this is what Una Stannard does in the preceding paragraph. Other topics involve several reasons, as in the passage by Professor Stewart. In that case you must arrange them in a significant order. If the causes are ssrial-A-tisataused by B, B by C, and C by D—the organization is predetermined: A—B—-C—D.
    
    But several reasons all contributing to the same consequence may be parallel, that is, having no causal connection within themselves and related only in all contributing to the same result. (Again, the passage by Professor Stewart is an example.) With parallel reasons you have more choice of arrangement. If they have an order in time, you will probably follow that. If they do not, you will probably have to rank the reasons in order of importance, usually, though not invariably, leading up to the most important:

    I doubt if the English temperament is wholly favourable to the development of the essayist. In the first place, an Anglo-Saxon likes doing things better than thinking about them; and in his memories, he is apt to recall how a thing was done rather than why it was done. In the next place, we are naturally rather prudent and secretive; we say that a man must not wear his heart upon his sleeve, and that is just what the essayist must do. We have a horror of giving ourselves away, and we like to keep ourselves to ourselves.
    "The Englishman's home is his castle," says another proverb. But the essayist must not have a castle, or if he does, both the grounds and the living-rooms must be open to the inspection of the public. A. C. Benson
    
    Reversing the order of Benson's two reasons would not impair the logic of his paragraph. However, it would disrupt the climactic structure. While Benson nowhere says that he considers the second reason more important, he gives it more than twice the space and repeats it three times.

    sequences discussed in the remainder of the paragraph. The
    paragraph may treat only a single effect, as in this passage
    about the moon affecting the tides:
    
    If the moon were suddenly struck out of existence, we should be
    immediately appraised of the fact by a wail from every seaport in
    the kingdom. From London and from Liverpool we should hear the
    same staryandhéall of the tide had almost ceased. The
    
    ships in dock could not get out; the ships outside could not get in;
    and the maritime commerce of the world would be thrown into
    dire confusion. Robert Ball
    
    Multiple Effects
    
    Often, however, a topic entails several effects, not just one,
    as in the following case (the writer is concerned with what
    the automobile has done to our society):

    Thirdly, worry about the private automobile. It is a dirty, noisy,
    wasteful, and lonely means of travel. It pollutes the air, ruins the
    safety and sociability of the street, and exercises upon the individual
    a discipline which takes away far more freedom than it gives him.
    It causes an enormous amount of land to be unnecessarily ab-
    stracted from nature and from plant life and to become devoid of
    any natural function. It explodes cities, grievously impairs the
    whole institution of neighborliness, fragmentizes and destroys com-
    munities. It has already spelled the end of our cities as real cultural
    and social communities, and has made impossible the construction
    of any others in their place. Together with the airplane, it has
    crowded out other, more civilized and more convenient means of
    transport, leaving older people, infirm people, poor people and
    children in a worse situation than they were a hundred years ago.
    It continues to lend a terrible element of fragility to our civilization,
    placing us in a situation where our life would break down com-
    pletely if anything ever interfered with the oil supply.
    
    George F. Kennan
    
    Kennan does not label the logic of his paragraph, not even
    by brief connectives like therefore or and so. But the sentence
    structure keeps the logic clear. Sentence after sentence begins
    with subject-verb, which suggests the cause-effect relation-
    ship: "It [the private automobile] is... It pollutes ... It
    causes ... It explodes ... It has The repetition of this
    pattern supports and clarifies the bogimplarof how
    
    sentence structure contributes to paragraph unity.
    
    Cause and Effect
    
    Thus far we have seen paragraphs that develop reasons to
    support the topic and those that develop effects. Often, how-
    ever, cause and effect are more intimately related. Many
    things are simultaneously causes and effects, as when the re-
    sult you expect an action to have is the reason you do it. In
    Kennan above the dire consequences of the au-
    tomobile are why he worries about it. The journalist Pete
    Idapmellses much the same point in the para- following
    graph, explaining that what the car has done to our society
    makes it "one of our jailers":
  - |-
    In fact, the automobile, which was hailed as a liberator of human beings early in this century, has become one of our jailers. The city air, harbor-cool and fresh at dawn, # sewer by Thé@t0-hour week, for which so many good union people died, is now a joke; on an average day, a large number of people now spend three to four hours simply traveling to those eight-hour-a-day jobs, stalled on roads, idling at bridges or in tunnels. Parking fees are $5 to $10 a day. The ruined city streets cost hundreds more for gashed tires, missing hubcaps and rattled engines.
    
    Frequently cause and effect compose a chain. A gives rise to B, B to C, and so on. Thus B would be both the effect of A and the cause of C. This paragraph about the effect of television in the 1950s on boxing (what the writer calls "the Sweet Science") develops such a series of causes and effects:
    
    The immediate crisis [of boxing] in the United States, forestalling the one high living standards might bring on, has been caused by
    130 THE EXPOSITORY PARAGRAPH
    
    the popularization of a ridiculous gadget called television. This is utilized in the sale of beer and razor blades. The clients of the television companies, by putting on a free boxing show almost every night of the week, have knocked out of business the hundreds of small-city and neighborhood boxing clubs where youngsters had a chance to learn their trade and journeymen to mature their skill. Consequently the number of good new prospects diminishes with every year, and the peddlers' public is already being asked to believe that a boy with perhaps ten or fifteen fights behind him is a topnotch performer. Neither advertising agencies nor brewers, and least of all the networks, give a hoot if they push the Sweet Science back into a period of genre painting. When it is in coma they will find some other way to peddle their peanuts. A.J. Liebling

    Liebling treats both reasons and consequences. The initial  
    cause is the use of television to sell products, the ultimate  
    effect is the deterioration of prizefighting. But linking these  
    are several conditions, each the effect of a preceding cause and  
    the cause of a subsequent effect:

    Final effect: Deterioration of professional boxing

    Paragraph Development:  
    (4) Definition, Analysis,  
    and Qualification
  - |-
    In its most basic sense, to define means "to set limits or boundaries." But in practice defining is rarely simple. Consider, for example, trying to set the limits of so vast an abstraction as "democracy." The problem of defining is further complicated by the fact that there are different kinds of definitions, serving different purposes, and using different means.
    
    Nominal and Real Definitions
    
    There is an elementary distinction in philosophy between the definition of a word and that of the entity (object, concept, emotion, whatever) which the word signifies. Definitions of words are called nominal (a dictionary definition is an ex-
    ample). Those of entities are called real. (This does not imply
    that nominal definitions are somehow false.) In practice the
    distinction between nominal and real definitions often does
    not matter very much. But sometimes it does. You should
    always be clear in your own mind whether you are primarily
    concerned with the word or the entity, and you must make
    it equally clear to the reader. If you are defining a word, un-
    derline it (equivalent to italic type). In the following para-
    graph, for instance, the writer wishes to make clear how the
    word history is commonly used:
    (4) DEFINITION, ANALYSIS, AND QUALIFICATION 133
    
    By its most common definition, the word history now means "the
    past of mankind." Compare the German word for history—Ges-
    chichte, which is derived from gesahielgenp happen.
    
    Geschichte is that which has happened. This meaning of the word
    history is often encountered in such overworked phrases as "all
    history teaches" or the "lessons of history." Louis Gottschalk
    
    Professor Gottschalk's is a nominal definition. The essayist
    G. K. Chesterton, on the other hand, in defining marriage is
    concerned with the institution and not the wohd—that
    is making a real definition:
  - |-
    Marriage is not a mere chain upon love as the anarchists say; nor is it a mere crown upon love as the sentimentalists say. Marriage is a fact, an actual human relation like that of motherhood, which has certain human habits and loyalties, except in a few monstrous cases where it is turned to a torture by special insanity and sin. A marriage is neither an ecstasy nor a slavery; it is a commonwealth; it is a separate working and fighting thing like a nation.
    
    Consensual, Stipulative,
    and Legislative Definitions
    
    Rather than kinds of definitions, the distinction here is more
    a matter of purpose. The purpose of a consensual definition
    is simply to tell us how people commonly use a word or what
    they understand a thing to be. It is what you find when you
    open your dictionary. A stipulative definition is a special
    meaning given to a word or entity for a particular purpose.
    It differs from the usual (consensual) definition, but is per-
    fectly legitimate so long as the writer clearly explains what he
    or she means and uses the term consistently in its special
    sense. A legislative definition also differs from the conven-
    tional sense; it is put forward as what the word ought to mean.
    It differs from a stipulative definition in that the writer is not
    saying, "For convenience I shall use X to mean such and so."
    Instead, the writer is asserting, "I shall use X to mean such
    and so, and this is its proper sense and everyone else should
    use it in this way too."
    
    Techniques of Defining
    
    Definitions are ped in various ways. For convenience
    
    we consider these techniques one at a time. However, they
    do not exclude one another, and in practice they are often
    combined.
    
    Definition by Species
    
    This is one of the most common means of definition. The
    entity or word being defined (called the definiendum)
    
    is set into its genus (class) and then distinguished from other
    members of that class:
    
    History is the recital of facts given as true, in contradistinction to
    the fable, which is the recital of facts given as false. Voltaire
  - |-
    Voltaire begins by setting "history" (the thing, not the word) into the genus "recital of facts." Then he differentiates it from the other member of that class, "fable."
    
    The bulk of a genus-species definition usually goes to differentiation. This may be done explicitly, as in Voltaire's case; that is, you actually mention the other member(s) of the class and explain how the definiendum differs from them. Or it may be done implicitly, where you do not actually name the other member(s) of the class but simply describe the definiendum so completely that it is, by implication, differentiated from them. Obviously a class of any size makes complete explicit differentiation impractical. If you were defining, say, football, it would take many, many pages to distinguish it from every other team sport.
    
    However you differentiate the thing you are defining, you must be clear about which of its attributes are essential and which are not. For example, the fact that football is played in stadiums (usually outdoors) before large crowds is not essential to its definition: baseball and soccer are also team sports played under similar conditions. On the other hand, the rules of football, the dimensions and the markings of the field, these facts are unique. Such essential attributes are what distinguish a definition. It does not mean that you should ignore incidental attributes altogether. If you were explaining football to a foreign friend, it would be important that he or she understand something about where and when it is played.
    
    The following explanation of what a map is illustrates a genus-species definition:
    
    A map is a conventional picture of an area of land, sea, or sky. Perhaps the maps most widely used are the road maps given away by the oil companies. They show the cultural features such as states, towns, parks, and roads, especially paved roads. They show also natural features, such as rivers and lakes, and sometimes mountains. As simple maps, most automobile drivers have on various occasions used sketches drawn by service station men, or by friends, to show the best automobile route from one town to another.
  - |-
    The distinction usually made between "maps" and "charts" is that a chart is a representation of an area consisting chiefly of water; a map represents an area that is predominantly land. It is easy to see how this distinction arose in the days when there was no navigation over land, but a truer distinction is that charts are specially designed for use in navigation, whether at sea or the air.
    
    Maps have been used since the earliest civilizations, and explorers find that they are used in rather simple civilizations at the present time by people who are accustomed to traveling. For example, Arctic explorers have obtained considerable help from maps of the coast lines showing settlements, drawn by Eskimo people. Occasionally maps show not only the roads, but pictures of other features. One of the earliest such maps dates from about B&C0 It shows not only roads, but also lakes with fish, and a canal with crocodiles and a bridge over the canal. This is somewhat similar to the modern maps of a state which show for each large town some feature of interest or the chief products of that town. C. C. Wylie

    Whylies first rap" in its genus ("a conventional picture of an area of land, sea, or sky") and illustrates it ("road maps"). Next he distinguishes "map" from the other member of its class ("chart"). Finally, in the third paragraph, he gives us information about maps which, although not essential to the defntetiesting and enlightening.
    
    In working out a genus-species definition, then, the essential questions to ask yourself are these:
    
    To what class does it belong?
    
    What unique qualities distinguish it from other members of that class?
    
    What other thalittesretewerportant if unique—are
    
    readers are fully to understand the word or thing?
    
    Defiiimgnyms
    
    A synonymous definition is simply explaining something in different words, usually simpler words. Synonyms are useful when you must use a term readers cannot reasonably be expected to know:
    
    Huge "pungs" (ox-or horse-drawn sledges), the connecting links between ocean commerce and New England farms, are drawn up in Dock Square three deep. ... Samuel Eliot Morison

    The questions Mr. Murrow brought up will rise to plague us again  
    because the answers given are not, as lawyers say, "responsive"—  
    they are not the permanent right answers, although they will do for  
    the day. Gilbert Sedes  
    
    Synonyms are also helpful if you must use an everyday  
    word in a special sense (what earlier we called a "stipulative  
    definition"):
    
    Love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and  
    know we cannot live within. Let the word "love" here not merely  
    in the personal sense but as a state of being, or a state of grace—

    not in the infantile American sense of being made happy but in the  
    tough and universal sense of quest and daring and growth.  
    James Baldwin  
    
    There is no sure guide to when you need to define a word.  
    Certainly a definition is needed when you use a technical  
    term in a passage intended for non-technical readers. Lawyers  
    do not have to be told the legal sense of "responsive," but the  
    rest of us do. And a definition is needed when you use a  
    common word in a special or personal sense, as Baldwin does  
    with "love." On the other hand, you waste time and insult read-  
    ers by defining commonplace words used conventionally.  
    
    Defining by Illustration  
    
    Examples are valuable when you define, especially in dealing  
    with abstractions. "Self-respect," is most easily ex-  
    plained by illustrating heroic (and perhaps non-heroic) actions.  
    In the following paragraph an anthropologist is explaining to  
    Americans what "self-respect" means to the Japanese. She  
    contrasts the Japanese conception of the quality with the  
    American.  
    
    The heart of her definition, however, lies in the examples  
    of how the Japanese behave to maintain self-respect:  
    
    In any language the contexts in which people speak of losing or  
    gaining self-respect throw a flood of light on their view of life. In  
    Japan "respecting yourself" is always to show yourself the careful  
    player. It does not mean, as it does in English usage, consciously  
    conforming to a worthy standard of trondling+meatn-

    Other, not lying, not giving false testimony. In Japan self-respect (jécli@rally "a self that is weighty," and its opposite is "a self that is light and floating." When a man says "You must respect your self," it means, "You must be shrewd in estimating all the factors involved in the situation and do nothing that will arouse criticism or lessen your chances of success." "Respecting yourself" often implies exactly the opposite behavior from that which it means in the United States. An employee says, "I must respect myself (jicho)," and it means, not that he must stand on his rights, but that he must say nothing to his employers that will get him into trouble. "You must respect yourself" had this same meaning, too, in political usage. It meant that a "person of weight" could not respect himself if he indulged in anything so rash as "dangerous thoughts." It had no implication, as it would in the United States, that even if thoughts are dangerous a man's self-respect requires that he think according to his own lights and his own conscience.
    
    Ruth Benedict
    
    Defining by Metaphor and Simile
    
    Metaphors and similes, which draw a kind of comparison, sometimes help to clarify the meaning of a word or concept. In a famous passage, the seventeenth-century Anglican clergyman Jeremy Taylor defined prayer using a series of metaphors, which culminated in the image of a lark:
  - |-
    Prayer is the peace of our spirit, the stillness of our thoughts, the
    evenness of recollection, the seat of meditation, the rest of our
    cares, and the ocean of tempest; prayer is the issue of a quiet
    mind, of untroubled thoughts, it is the daughter of charity and the
    sister of meekness; and he that prays to God with an angry, that is,
    with a troubled and discomposed spirit, is like him that retires into
    a battle to meditate, and sets up his closet in the outposts of an
    army, and chooses a frontier-garrison to be wise in. Anger is a per-
    fect alienation of the mind from prayer, and therefore is contrary to
    that attention which presents our prayers in a right line to God. For
    so have a lark rising from his bed of grass, and soaring up-
    wards, singing as he rises, and hopes to get to heaven, and climb
    above the clouds; but the poor bird was beaten back with the loud
    sighings of an eastern wind, and his motion made irregular and
    unconstant, descending more at every breath of the tempest than it
    could recover by the liberation and frequent weighing of his wings:
    till the little creature was forced to sit down and pant, and stay till
    the storm was over; and then it made a prosperous flight, and did
    rise and sing, as if it had learned music and motion from an angel
    as he passed sometimes through the air about his ministries here
    below.
    
    (4) DEFINITION, ANALYSIS, AND QUALIFICATION 139
    
    Definitions
    
    Negative definition tells us what something is not. Thus in
    the passage below miserliness is defined in terms of its an-
    tithesis, thrift:
  - |-
    Thrift by derivation means thriving; and the miser is the man who does not thrive. The whole meaning of thrift is making the most of everything; and the miser does not make anything of anything. He is the man in whom the process, from the seed to the crop, stops at the intermediate mechanical stage of the money. He does not grow things to feed men; not even to feed one man; not even to feed himself. The miser is the man who starves himself, and everybody else, in order to worship wealth in its dead form, as distinct from its living form. G. K. Chesterton
    
    Paired or Field Definition
    
    Occasionally the sense of one word or concept is intimately tied to that of a second (or of several) so that the terms can be defined only by reference to one another. Such words comprise a field of meaning; for example, think of the titles designating commissioned rank in the United States Army: captain cannot be understood without reference to first lieutenant and ranger; these in turn imply second lieutenant and lieutenant colonel and so on through the entire series of grades. In this paragraph a scholar defines the two kinds of source material available to historians:
    
    Written and oral sources are divided into two kinds: primary and secondary. A primary source is the testimony of an eyewitness, or of a witness by any other of the senses, or of a mechanical device like the dictaphone—that which was present at the events of which he or it tells (hereafter called simply eyewitness). A secondary source is the testimony of anyone who is not an eyewitness, that is not present at the events of which he tells. A primary source must thus have been produced by a contemporary of the events it narrates. It does not, however, need to be original in the legal sense of the word original—that the very document (usually the first written draft) whose contents are the subject of discussion—whether a copy or a printed edition will do just as well; in the case of the Greek and Roman classics, seldom are any but later copies available.
    Louis Gottschalk
  - |-
    Defikingiology and Semantic History  
    Awotlofrgetting at the meaning of a word is through its root meaning (the etymology) and the changes that meaning has undergone (the semantic history). In the following paragraph the concept of a university is defined by returning to an older name for the institution and exploring the implications of the term:
    
    Ifdlere asked to describe as briefly and popularly as collld, what a University was, Should draw my answer from its ancient designation of a Studium Generate or "School of Universal Learning." This description implies the assemblage of strangers from purts in one spot;—from ail parts; else, how will you find professors and students for every department of knowledge? and in one spot, else, how can there be any school at all? Accordingly, in its simple and rudimental form, it is a school of knowledge of every kind, consisting of teachers and learners from every quarter. Many things are requisite to complete and satisfy the idea embodied in this description; but such as this a university seems to be in its essence, a place for the communication and circulation of thought, by means of personal intercourse, through a wide extent of country.
    
    John Henry Newman
    
    While relatively easy, using etymologies and older meanings has limitations. You must use dictionaries cautiously. The etymology of a word is not necessarily its "proper" sense. Word meanings change and it cannot be argued that the contemporary sense of a word is somehow wrong because it has strayed from the original. Nor do dictionary definitions tell the whole story. No matter how sensitive and thorough, they have to exclude many subtleties of meaning.

    Analysis or Classification
    
    In a broad sense all expository paragraphs are analytical. To write about any subject you must analyze particulars (whether reasons or comparisons, illustrations or consequences) and then organize these into a coherent whole. More narrowly, however, analysis refers to the specific technique of developing a topic by distinguishing its components and discussing each in turn. G. K. Chesterton, for example, analyzes the category "people" in this way:

    Roughly speaking, there are three kinds of people in this world. The
    first kind of people are People; they are the largest and probably
    the most valuable class. We owe to this class the chairs we sit down
    on, the clothes we wear, the houses we live and, indeed (when
    
    we come to think of it), we probably belong to this class ourselves.
    The second class may be called for convenience the Poets; they
    are often a nuisance to their families, but, generally speaking, a
    blessing to mankind. The third class is that of the Professors or
    Intellectuals, sometimes described as the thoughtful people; and
    these are a blight and a desolation both to their families and also
    to mankind. Of course, the classification sometimes overlaps, like
    all classification. Some good people are almost poets and some bad
    poets are almost professors. But the division follows lines of real
    psychological cleavage. We not offer it lightly. It has been the fruit
    of more than eighteen minutes of earnest reflection and research.
    
    Chesterton develops his point by asking, in effect, "What
    kinds of people are there?" The strategy of paragraph building is also called classification. (Chesterton uses the terms
    Classification and class several times.) Speaking strictly, anal-
    ysis and classification are not identical. The first begins with
    the general and works into particulars; the second starts with
    the particulars and sorts them into categories. But, practically
    speaking, the difference is not very significant. Both are con-
    cerned with a class and a number of specifics, and the problem
    is to make clear that a class encompasses particulars. Thus in
    Chesterton's humorous analysis the broad category "people"
    142 THE EXPOSITORY PARAGRAPH
    
    is composed of the particular groups "People," "Poets," and
    "Professors."
  - |-
    Sorting out concrete topics, whether people or varieties of apples, is the easiest kind of analysis. But the technique also works with abgtmsietidns—ethe club, for instance, or the economic classes of a complex society. In the following example the writer explains how the watches were arranged on a nineteenth-century sailing vessel. (The term watch has a double meaning: the two divisions of the crew, who alternated in working the ship, and the periods of the twenty-four-hour day when the groups were on duty.)
    
    The crew are divided into two divisions, as equally as may be, called the watches. Of these, the chief mate commands the larboard, and the second mate the starboard. They divide the time between them, being on and off duty, or as it is called, on deck and below, every other four hours. The three night watches are called the first, the middle, and the morning watch. If, for instance, the chief mate with the larboard watch have the first night watch from eight to twelve, at that hour the starboard watch and the second mate take the deck, while the larboard watch and the first mate go below until four in the morning, when they come on deck again and remain until eight. As the larboard watch will have been on deck eight hours out of the twelve, while the starboard watch will have been up only four hours, the former have what is called a "forenoon watch below," that is, from eight A.M. till twelve A.M. In a man-of-war, and in some merchantmen, this alternation of watches is kept up throughout the twenty-four hours, which is called having "watch and watch"; but our ship, like most merchantmen, had "all hands" from twelve o'clock till dark, except in very bad weather, when we were allowed "watch and watch."

    Analysis of a Process
    
    A process is a sequence of operations directed toward a specific end. Knitting a sweater, for example, is a process, from buying the pattern and wool to the final blocking and shaping. So is the election of a political candidate or registering for college.

    In most cases the steps are clearly defined. The writer's task is first to understand the process, analyzing its stages in his or her own mind; and second to explain those stages clearly. Here is an example, more abstract than knitting a sweater, describing the methodology of science:
    
    [T]here is a fairly clear pattern of the operation of the scientific method. First, regularities are recognized as such and recorded. Then, a formulation is sought which, preferably in the simplest and most general way, contains these regularities. This then has the status of a law of nature. The newly formulated law may, and usually will, predict further regularities which were previously unknown. Finally, the objective is a combination of two or more of these laws into a still more general formulation. For instance, the great significance of Einstein's theory of special relativity is due to the fact that it provides a combination of the electromagnetic laws with those of mechanics.

    For Practice
    
    > Choosing any two of the following topics, compose two separate paragraphs of analysis. Begin with a topic sentence like Chesterton's (page 40d) unify the paragraph with appropriate connecting words.
    
    Types of husbands (or wives)
    
    Kinds of dancing
    
    Varieties of detective fiction
    
    Different kinds of hammers (or other tool)
    
    Automobile salesmen
    
    > Write a set of directions for some simple activity (hitting a golf ball, say, repotting a plant, or any such process). The problem— and it is not as simple as analyzing the process into its steps and to explain these clearly.
    
    I4¥POSITORY PARAGRAPH THE
    
    Qualification >
    
    It is often necessary to admit that what you are asserting is not absolutely true or always applicable. Doing so is called qualification. Qualification always risks blurring your focus. Suppose, for example, that a writer is urging a criticism of college football. He or she begins:
    
    College football is a semi-professional sport.
    
    This is clear and emphatic. But it isn't exactly true: the issue is not that simple.
    
    Now suppose that, recognizing this complexity, the writer adds a second sentence:
    
    College football is a semi-professional sport. Some universities do play a purely amateur game.
  - |-
    The new sentence makes the writer less vulnerable to the charge of oversimplification, but the protection has been purchased at the expense of possibly confusing readers, who are no longer sure what to expect. Will the paragraph be about universities which subsidize football, or about those which do not?
    
    As this example suggests, qualification involves at least the appearance of contradiction. The trick is to qualify without confusing readers as to the main point. It is not difficult to do, once you understand a few basic principles.
    
    DWhenever possible, subordinate the qualification.
    
    College football is a semiprofessional sport, although some universities do play a purely amateur game.
    
    This makes better sense. By expressing the qualification in the adverbial clause reduces its importance. The thought, however, still progresses awkwardly.
    
    (4) DEFINITION, ANALYSIS, AND QUALIFICATION 145
    
    Placing the qualification uppermost in the reader's mind brings us to a second principle.
    
    [> When you plan, the qualification first and wind up on the main point.
    
    Although some universities do play a purely amateur game, college football is a semiprofessional sport.
    
    Use qualifying words and phrases.
    
    Although a few universities do play a purely amateur game, big-time college football is, in general, a semiprofessional sport.
    
    The addition of such expressions as "a few," "big-time," and "in general" further limits the writer's assertion. So phrased, the sentence has sufficient qualification to forestall easy challenge from those who disagree with it. Yet it remains clearly focused.
    
    [> When a qualification must be expressed in a separate sentence, lag it with a word stressing its obviousness and follow it by repeating the major idea.
    
    Big-time college football is a semiprofessional sport. Of course a few universities do play a purely amateur game. But these are only a few; on the whole, the game is subsidized.
  - |-
    It is not always possible to include a qualification in the same sentence that carries the main point. In that event, introducing the qualification with an admission of its truth tends to disarm it. "Of course" (or "certainly," "obviously," "admittedly," "it is true that"), you write, "such and such is the case." The initial adverb tells the reader that you are well aware of the exception, which, the adverb implies, doesn't matter very much. With the qualification completed, you then reassert your main point, beginning it with a strong signal of contradiction ("but," "however," "yet," "still," "even so").
    
    At times a qualification requires several sentences or even an entire paragraph. For example, George R. Stewart, arguing that the American colonists constituted an essentially homogeneous culture, writes:
    
    With few exceptions the colonists of European stock were of northwestern European origins, and there can have been, racially, only negligible differences among them. Even in their cultural backgrounds they differed little. They were heirs of the European Middle Ages, of the Renaissance, and of the Reformation. They were Christians by tradition, and nearly all were Protestants.
    
    Naturally the groups differed somewhat, one from another, and displayed some clannishness. They were conscious of their differences, often more conscious of differences than of resemblances. Thus a Pennsylvania governor was already voicing the cry that the American conservative has echoed ever since. "We are being overwhelmed by the immigrants!" he said in effect. "Will our country not become German instead of English?"
    
    Nevertheless, from the perspective of two centuries and from the point of view of the modern world with its critical problems of nationality and race, the differences existing among the various colonial groups fade into insignificance. We sense, comparatively speaking, a unified population. In the political realm, indeed, there were divergences that might lead even to tarrings and featherings, but racially and socially and religiously the superficial differences were less important than the basic unity.
  - |-
    Professor Stewart's second paragraph qualifies the point he makes in the first and returns to in the third. Notice that he begins paragraph two with "Naturally," removing the sting from the concession, and that he opens paragraph three with an emphatic "Nevertheless." (The final sentence of that paragraph, incidentally, contains a brief qualification of its own. Can you identify it?)
    
    For Practice
    
    > Identify the qualifications in these passages and decide whether they are effective:
    
    (4) DEFINITION, ANALYSIS, AND QUALIFICATION 147
    
    To my mind King James's Bible has been a very harmful influence on English prose. I am not so stupid as to deny its great beauty. It is Bajestéclible is an oriental book. Its alien imagery
    
    has nothing to do with us. Those hyperboles, those luscious metaphors, are foreign §@rdus. Somerset Maugham W,
    
    "When the belly is full," runs the Arab proverb, "it says to the head, 'Sing, fellow!' " That is not always so; the belly may get overfull. Such a proverb clearly comes from a race familiar with bellies painfully empty. Yet it remains true, dhink, that when the body is in
    
    radiant health, it becomes extremely difficult for it not to infect the mind with its own sense of well-being. F. L. Lucas
    
    [> Four pairs of sentences follow. Revise each pair twice, combining them into a single sentence to make an effective qualification. In the first revision of each pair use idea (1) as the main point and (2) as the qualification; in the second, reverse the relationship. Try to keep to the wording, but you may change the order of the clauses and add qualifying words:
    
    A. (1) Baseball is the great American game.
    (2) Its supremacy is being challenged by other sports.
    
    B. The Romans are regarded as culturally inferior to the Greeks.
    (2) The Romans created a great and long-lasting empire.
    
    C. @Xercise is necessary to health.
    (2) Too much exercise, or the wrong kind, can hurt you.
  - |-
    Good sentences are the sinew of style. They give to prose its
    forward thrust, its flexibility, its strong and subtle rhythms.
    The cardinal virtues of such sentences are clarity, emphasis,
    concision, and variety. How to achieve these qualities will be
    our major concern in this part. First, however, we must un-
    derstand, in a brief and rudimentary way, what a sentence is.
    
    It is not easy to say. In fact, it is probably impossible to
    define a sentence to everyone's satisfaction. On the simplest
    level it may be described as a word or group of words stand-
    ing by itself, that is, beginning with a capital letter and ending
    with a period, question mark, or exclamation point. (In speech
    the separateness of a sentence is marked by intonation and
    pauses.)
    
    And yet an effective sentence involves more than starting
    with a capital and stopping with a period. The word or words
    must make sense, expressing an idea or perception or feeling
    clear enough to stand alone. For example, consider these two
    sentences:
    
    The package arrived. Finally.
    
    The first consists of a subject and verb. The second is only a
    single word, an adverb detached from a verb (arrived). The
    idea might have been expressed in one sentence:
    
    1§2 THE SENTENCE
    
    The package finally arrived.
    The package arrived, finally.
    Finally, the package arrived.
    
    But we can imagine a situation in which a speaker or writer,
    wanting to stress exasperation, feels that finally should be a
    sentence by itself.
    
    As that example indicates, there are sentences which con-
    tain subjects and verbs and sentences which do not. The first
    kind is grammatically complete" and
    is the conventional form sentences take in composition. The
    second type of sentence {Finally in our example) does not
    contain a subject and verb and is called #ragment. Fragments
    are more common in speech than in writing, but even in for-
    mal composition they have their place, which we'll consider
    in a subsequent chapter.
    
    The Grammatical Sentence
    
    The grammatically complete sentence is independent, con-
    tains a subject and a predicate, and is properly constructed.
    That definition may sound a bit formidable, but it really isn't.
    Let's briefly consider each of those three criteria.
    
    Grammatical Independence
  - |-
    Grammatical independence simply means that the words constituting the sentence are not acting as a noun or modifier or verb in connection with any other word or words. For example, "Harry was late" is independent. "Became Harry was late" is not. Because "became" turns the words into an adverb (more exactly, an adverbial clause). The construction should modify another verb or clause as in "The men were delayed in starting because Harry was late."
    
    1. The fact that "Because Harry was late" is not independent does not mean it cannot serve as a sentence. In the right context it could effectively stand alone. But it would be a fragment.
    
    A DEFINITION 153
    
    To take one more case. "They failed to agree" is a grammatical sentence. "That they failed to agree" is not. It is a noun clause and could function as the subject of a verb:
    
    "That they failed to agree was unfortunate."
    Or as the object of one:
    
    "We know that they failed to agree."
    
    Subject and Predicate
    
    The heart of a grammatical sentence is the subject and predicate. In a narrow sense the subject is the words identifying who or what the sentence is about, and the predicate is the verb, expressing something about the subject. In a broader sense, the subject includes the subject word(s) plus all modifiers, and the predicate includes the verb together with its objects and modifiers. For instance in "The man who lives next door decided last week to sell his house,"
    
    or grammatical, subject is "man," and the narrow, or grammatical, verb is "decided." The broad, or notional, subject is "The man who lives next door," and the broad, or notional, predicate is "decided last week to sell his house."
  - |-
    The verb in a grammatical sentence must be finite, that is,
    limited with reference to time or person or number. English
    has several nextfirms called participles and infini-
    tives {Sexxymple, and to be). These can refer to any
    interval of time and can be used with any person or with
    either number. But by convention these nonfinite forms can-
    not by themselves make a sentence. Thus Harry was late is a
    grammatical sentence, but Harry being late isn't because it
    contains only the participle being instead of a finite form such
    as was.
    
    Proper Construction
    
    Even though a group of words is grammatically independent
    and contains a subject and a finite verb, it will not qualify as
    1§4 THE SENTENCE
    
    a grammatical sentence unless it is put together according to
    the rules. "Rules" here does not mean regulations arbitrarily
    laid down by experts. It means how we, all of us, use English.
    Thus Harry late was is not a good sentence. We simply do
    not arrange these words in that order.
    
    Here's one other example of a nonsentence resulting from
    bad construction:
    
    Harry was late, and although he was sorry.
    
    And can only combine elements that are grammatically
    equaherewanbjects of the same verb, for instance.
    
    In this case and joins two unequal nodestructions—the
    pendent clause Harry was late and the dependent (adverbial)
    clause although he was sorry. The construction can be turned
    into a legitimate grammatical sentence in either of two ways:
    
    Harry was late, although he was sorry.
    Harry was late, and he was sorry.
    
    The Building Blocks
    
    The basic slots of a grammatical serttensebjattat
    verb, object, and bheofllfeer-bymmyny kinds of
    words, phrases, and dependent clauses, the building blocks of
    sentences.
    
    Phrases and dependent clauses are both functional word
    gooupsretwords acting collectively in a gram-
    matical function, as a subject, for instance, or direct object or
    adverb, and so on. Functional word groups are enormously
    important. They enable us to treat ideas too complex to be
    expressed in single words as though they were, grammatically,
    only one word. Take these two sentences:
    
    I know Susan.
  - |-
    I know that you won't like that movie.
    
    A DEFINITION 1§§
    
    Susan is the direct object of know. So is that you won't like
    that movie. For purposes of grammar the six-word clause
    functions like the one-word proper noun. Being able to use
    the full range of functional word groups available in English
    is essential to writing well. Here is a quick summary.
    
    Phrases
    
    A phrase is a functional word group that does not contain
    subject-finite verb combination, although some phrases do
    use nonfinite verb forms. We can distinguish five kinds of
    phrases: verb, prepositional, participial, gerundive, and
    infinitive.
    
    A verb phrase is a main verb plus any auxiliaries:
    
    They have been calling all day.
    
    A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition (in, of, to, and
    so on) plus an object, plus (often though not invariably) mod-
    ifiers of the object:
    
    Three people were sitting on the beautiful green lawn.
    
    The chief function of prepositional phrases is to modify,
    either as adjectives or as adverbs. A participial phrase is
    constructed around a participle, usually in the present (run-
    ning, for example) or past (run) participle form. It acts as an
    adjective:
    
    The man running down the street seemed suspicious.
    
    Here the participial phrase modifies man. A gerundive phrase
    also uses the present participle but in a construction that func-
    tions as a noun. In the following example the gerundive
    
    phrase is the subject of the verb phrase can be:
    
    Running for political office can be very expensive.
    
    156 THE SENTENCE
    
    An infinitive phrase, finally, is built around one of the infin-
    itives (usually the active present form). Infinitive phrases may act either as nouns or as modifiers. In this
    sentence the phrase is the direct object of the verb, a nounal
    function:
    
    They want me to go to medical school.
    Here it is an adjective modifying time:
    
    We had plenty of time to get there and back.
    
    Clauses
  - |-
    A clause is a functional word group that does contain a subject and a finite verb. There are two basic clauses—independent and dependent. An independent clause can stand alone as a sentence. In fact a simple sentence like We saw you coming is an independent clause. But usually the term is reserved for such a construction when it occurs as part of a larger sentence. The sentence below, for instance, consists of two independent clauses:
    
    We saw you coming, and we were glad.
    
    A dependent clause cannot stand alone as a grammatically complete sentence. It serves as part of a sentence—a object, adjective, or adverb. If we were to place when before the opening clause in the example above, we would turn it into a dependent (adverbial) clause modifying the second clause (which remains independent):
    
    When we saw you coming we were glad.
    Dependent clauses may also act as nouns, either as subjects (as in the first of the following sentences) or as objects (as in the second):
      
    A DEFINITION 157
    
    Why he went at all is a mystery to me.
    We knew that she would be pleased.
    
    And as adjectives:
    
    The point that you're trying to make just isn't very clear.
    
    Absolutes
    
    An absolute is something more than a functional word group but less than a sentence. It is connected by idea but not through grammar to the rest of the statement in which it occurs:
    
    She flew down the stairs, her children tumbling after her.
    
    This absolute tells us something about the circumstances attending the lady's rush downstairs, but it doesn't modify anything in the main clause, nor is it an object or a subject. It simply is not a grammatical part of that clause. (The term absolute derives from a Latin word meaning "free, unrestricted.")
    
    The Basic Types of Grammatical Sentences
    
    Depending on the number and type of clauses they contain, grammatical sentences fall into three patterns: the simple, the compound, and the complex. In addition, there are compound-complex sentences, though they are not truly basic.
    
    The Simple Sentence
  - |-
    Simple sentences consist of one subject-verb nexus (Nexus means a grammatical connection between words, as in The children laughed.) Usually a simple sentence has only one subject and one verb, but it may have—and do—several
    
    158 THE SENTENCE
    
    of each and remain simple, providing that the various subjects and verbs comprise a single connection, as in the sentence The children and their parents laughed and were glad, in which the single nexus may be indicated like this:
    
    The Compound Sentence
    
    A compound sentence consists of at least two independent subject-verb nexuses:
    
    The children laughed, and their parents were glad.
    
    Compound sentences often have three independent clauses or even four or five. In theory there is no limit. In practice, however, most compound sentences contain only two clauses. Stringing out a number is likely to make an awkward, bling sentence.
    
    The two (or more) independent clauses comprising a compound sentence may be united in two ways. One is coordination, connecting clauses by a coordinating conjunction— and, but, for, or, nor, either, not, neither...
    
    .. but also, both ... and:
    
    The sea was dark and rough, and the wind was strong from the east.
    
    The second method of joining clauses is parataxis, which is simply butting them together without a conjunction (conventionally they are punctuated by a semicolon):
    
    The sea was dark and rough; the wind was strong from the east.
    
    A DEFINITION
    
    As we shall see later (Chapter 19) these two ways of connecting independent clauses are not necessarily interchangeable. In most cases one will be better than the other.
    
    The Complex Sentence
    
    A complex sentence contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. Here are several examples:
    
    independ. depend.
    1 4
    We saw |that you were tired.
    
    depend, independ,
    J 4
    Because the day was cloudy, they put off the picnic.
    
    independ. depend.
    1 L
    I like the people| who live next door.
  - |-
    In a complex sentence the independent clause is called the main clause, and the dependent clauses are subordinate clauses that function as a noun or adverb or adjective—these are called subordinates.
    
    Of course a complex sentence may contain a number of subordinate clauses, but it can only have one main clause. This type of sentence is very important in composition, and we shall study it more closely in Chapter 19.
    
    The Compound-Complex Sentence
    
    A compound-complex sentence must have at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent:
    
    independ. depend. independ.
    1 1 4
    We thought that we would go, but we decided not to.

    Some sentences are grammatically complete; others—called
    
    fragments—are
    
    . Grammatical sentences must satisfy three criteria: they must (a)
    
    be grammatically independent, (b) have a subject and a finite
    verb, and (c) be properly constructed.
    
    . The parts of a sentence are subject, verb, object, and modifier.
    . These parts may be filled by single words or by functional word
    
    groups.
    
    . Functional word groups act grammatically as though they were
    
    one word. They include phrases and dependent clauses.
    
    . A phrase does not contain a subject-finite verb combination,
    
    though it may have a subject and a nonfinite verb form, either
    a participle or an infinitive.
    
    There are several kinds of phrases; prepositional, participial, gerundive, and infinitive.
    
    Clauses may be independent or dependent. Only dependent
    clauses act as functional word groups.
    
    1. Dependent clauses are classified according to their grammatical role as noun, adverbial, or adjectival clauses.

    a sentence. It is related in idea but not in grammar to the rest
    of the sentence in which it occurs.
    
    Grammatical sentences come in three basic types—simple,
    compound, and compound-complex. Of the last two,
    
    the compound-complex sentence.
  - |-
    In the last chapter we defined three grammatical sentences—
    simple, compound, and disjunctive,
    
    though not grammatically complete, may still stand as a sen-
    tence. From these types derive seven sentence styles: the seg-
    regating sentence, the freight-train sentence, the cumulative,
    parallel, balanced, subordinating, and—once again—the
    ment. We shall review them in this chapter.
    
    We need to be clear at the outset about two points. First,
    none of these styles is inherently better or worse than the
    others. Each is suited to some effects, ill-adapted to others.
    Second, the styles are not mutually exclusive. In fact, a skillful
    writer uses all of them.
    
    The Segregating Style
    
    At its purest the segregating sentence is grammatically simple,
    expressing a single idea.' A segregating style consists of a se-
    ries of such sentences. In practice the style is rarely confined
    
    1. "Idea" is a slippery word. Here it means simply one subject plus one pred-
    ication about that subject: The night was dark expresses a single idea. Most
    sentences consist of several: The night was dark, and it was lonely. Or,.with
    the two predications more closely connected: The night was dark and lonely.
    
    162 THE SENTENCE
    
    to technically simple, one-idea statements. That would be mo-
    notonous. Instead, a segregating style consists of relatively
    short, uncomplicated sentences, even though some of them
    may not be simple in the grammatical sense. Here, for ex-
    ample, a critic is describing how a particular novelist works:
    
    He writes, at most, 750 words a day. He writes and rewrites. He
    polishes and repolishes. He works in solitude. He works with ag-
    ony. He works with sweat. And that is the only way to work at
    all. Beverly Nichols
    
    As this passage shows, a segregating style can be very effec-
    tive. Short sentences are strong and repetitive, qualities ex-
    actly suited to Nichols's purpose. He wants to stress that
    writing often iwerksutilbn isftinonotonous
  - |-
    The importance of the relationship between sentence style and purpose is essential to good writing. The same general point may be put in any of various ways, but no two of the ways will be the same, and only one will be exactly what you want to say.
    
    Segregating sentences are especially useful in descriptive and narrative writing. They analyze a complicated perception or action into its parts and arrange these in a significant order. In the following passage, W Somerset Maugham describes a Chinese criminal being led to his place of execution (in colonial times the British vice-consul had to be present when the victim of the crime was English):
    
    The judge gave order and the vice-consul rose and walked to
    the gateway, where their chairs awaited them. Here stood the crim-
    inal with his guard. Notwithstanding his tied hands he smoked a
    cigarette. A squad of little soldiers had been sheltering themselves
    under the overhanging roof, and on the appearance of the judge
    the officer in charge made them form up. The judge and the vice-
    consul settled themselves in their chairs. The officer gave an order
    and the squad stepped out. A couple of yards behind them walked
    the criminal. Then came the judge in his chair and the vice-consul.
    
    SENTENCE STYLES 163
    
    This is a fine example of a segregating style. The sentences
    are short and uncomplicated (even though three of them are
    not simple, and none treats only a single idea). They break
    the scene into a series of tableaux, each rendered without
    comment. The effect is to distance us from the action, yet the
    technique is not that of a callous observer, but of an artist
    willing to let the event speak for itself. Like all effective styles,
    Maugham's deepens meaning, shocking us into seeing that in
    the society he is describing life and death do not matter very
    much.
    
    The segregating style, then, can be effective in description
    and narration. It is less useful in exposition, where you must
    combine ideas in subtle gradations of logic and importance.
    These subtleties cannot be conveyed by a series of short, in-
    dependent statements, which treat all ideas as equally
    important.
    
    Individually used, however, segregating sentences are val-
    uable in exposition, especially set beside longer statements,
    where they will seem strong and clear:
  - |-
    Before election day he [dangly] predicted he would win if rain didn't keep the mud farmers away from the polls. It rained. Hodding Carter
    
    The first premise of the college elective system is that the subjects are of approximately equal importance. Well, they are not.
    Brand Blanshard
    
    Short sentences like these are emphatic and create variety.
    (More examples will be seen in Chapters 21 and 23, where we
    discuss emphasis and variety.) Every writer should be able to
    handle the short sentence to stress particular ideas and, when
    the occasion warrants, to compose brief passages in a segregating style. On the whole, however, the style is too limited
    for general use in exposition. In unskilled hands it soon begins
    to sound like a third-grade reader: Dick has a dog. The dog's
    name is Spot. Spot is a friendly dog.

    game or a party. Use a segregating style to analyze the scene or
    action.
    
    The Freight-Train Style
    
    Several kinds of sentences do what the segregating style does
    not tolerate. They enhance ideas. The simplest of these is the
    freight-train style, so called because it couples short, independent clauses to make longer sequential statements. It is a
    development of the compound sentence (see page 106)
    
    has an old and honored history:
    
    And the rain descended and the floods came, and the winds blew,
    and beat upon the house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.
    Matthew, 7:27
    
    The freight-train sentence has several virtues. It is useful
    when you wish to link a series of events, ideas, impressions,
    feelings, or perceptions as immediately as possible, without
    judging their relative value or imposing a logical structure
    upon them. Children often experience reality in this immediate, accepting way, and authors writing for children or trying to suggest a childlike vision may employ the style:
  - |-
    And I'll look out for you, and you'll sing out as soon as you see me. And we'll go down the street arm in arm, and into all the shops, and then I'll choose my house, and you'll choose your house, and we'll live there like princes and good fellows. Kenneth Grahame
    
    Even in writing that expresses more adult attitudes, the same desire to convey mental experience directly may lead a writer to select the following passage from Ernest Hemingway's novel A Farewell to Arms, the hero
    
    SENTENCE STYLES 165
    
    forgets the dull routine of army life for seizing adventure with the heroine:
    
    Maybe she would pretend that was her boy that was killed and we would go in the front door [of a small hotel] and the porter would take off his cap and would stop at the concierge's desk and ask for the key and she would stand by the elevator and then we would get in the elevator and it would go up very slowly clicking at all the floors and then our floor and the boy would open the door and stand there and she would step out and would step out and we would walk down the hall and would put the key in the door and open it and go in and then take down the telephone and ask them to send a bottle of capri bianca in a silver bucket full of ice and you would hear the ice against the pail coming down the corridor and the boy would knock and would say leave it outside the door please.

    Both Hemingway use the sentence to describe an experience taking place within the mind.
    The style suggests the continuous flow of dreaming, for we
    fantasize in a stream of loosely connected feelings and ideas
    and images, not in neatly packaged sentences of intricately
    related clauses and phrases tied together by if but, yet,
    therefore, consequently, on the other hand. Indeed, we some-
    times fantasize not in words at all but in imagined percep-
    tions, as Hemingway implies ("and you would hear the ice
    against the pail"). Hemingway also goes further than Gra-
    hame in imitating the mental state of fantasy: his one sentence
    is much longer and its flow unimpeded by punctuation. This
    technique is a variety of what is called "stream of conscious-
    ness," a way of writing that suggests a mind feeling, dreaming,
    thinking in a loose associational manner.
    
    Multiple Coordination and Parataxis
    
    The Grahame, Hemingway, and biblical examples all use mul-
    tiple coordination, linking clauses by coordinating conjunc-
    tions—such as in most, by using the word and.
    Instead of being coordinated, however, independent clauses
    can be butted together without conjunctions, in which case
    they are conventionally punctuated by semicolons, though
    sometimes commas are clear enough. This is called parataxis.
    Although either multiple coordination or parataxis is pos-
    sible in a freight-train sentence, they are not exact equivalents.
    Broadly speaking, the first is used when the ideas or
    feelings or perceptions are loosely related—such as a desire for a quick and fluid movement from clause to clause.
    These conditions are true of the three examples we have just
    seen, as they are of the following relatively short sentence by
    Hemingway:
    
    It was a hot day and the sky was bright and the road was white
    and dusty.
  - |-
    There is movement here, involving both the scene and the
    sense by which we perceive it: we feel the heat, see the sky,
    lower our eyes to gaze down the road. The sentence style
    directs our senses much as a camera directs them in a film,
    guiding us from one perception to another, yet creating a con-
    tinuous experience. The freight-train style, then, can analyze
    experience much like a series of segregating sentences. But it
    brings the parts more closely together, and when it uses mul-
    tiple coordination, it achieves a high degree of fluidity.
    
    On the other hand, fluidity is not always desirable. Ideas
    or perceptions may be repetitive, with little change and noth-
    ing to flow together. Then parataxis is preferable to multiple
    coordination. In the following example Virginia Woolf,
    marizing a diary of an eighteenth-century Englishman visiting
    France, uses a freight-train style to mock his insularity:
    
    This is what he writes about, and, of course, about the habits of the
    natives. The habits of the natives are disgusting; the women hawk
    on the floor, the forks are dirty; the trees are poor; the Pont Neuf is
    not a patch on London Bridge; the cows are skinny; morals are
    licentious; polish is good; cabbages cost so much; bread is made
    of coarse flour.
    
    SENTENCE STYLES 167
    
    Each detail is another instance of the same underlying insen-
    sitivity. By hooking her clauses with semicolons (in one case
    with a comma) Woolf stresses the dull, unyielding vision of
    the diarist.
    
    Along with its advantages, the freight-train sentence has
    limitations. Like the segregating style, it does not handle ideas
    very subtly. The freight-train sentence implies that the
    thoughts it links together with grammatical equality are
    equally significant. But usually ideas are not of the same order
    of importance; some are major, others secondary. Moreover,
    this type of construction cannot show very precise logical
    relationships of cause and effect, condition, concession, and
    so on. It joins ideas only with such general conjunctions as
    and, but, or, nor or even less exactly with semicolons and
    commas.
    
    The Triadic Sentence
  - |-
    A second deficiency of the freight-train sentence is that it lacks a clear shape. Being open-ended, it has no necessary stopping place; one could go on and on adding clauses. As a way of providing it with a clearer structural principle, the freight-train sentence is sometimes composed in three units and is called a triad:
    
    Her showmanship was superb; her timing sensational; her dramatic instinct uncanny. Robert Coughlan
    
    Business executives, economists, and the public alike knew little of the industrial system they were operating; they were unable to diagnose the malady; they were unaware of the great forces operating beneath the Surditce. Thurman
    
    Often, as in these examples, the three clauses are paratactic rather than coordinated because the triadic sentence tends to
    
    2. These sentences are also called tricolons. Loosely, colon designated in ancient Greek rhetoric an independent clause that was part of a longer sentence. A tsiealovtence of three such clauses.
    
    168 THE SENTENCE
    
    be repetitive. But it can use conjunctions when shifts in subject occur:
    
    Then the first star came out and the great day was over and in the vestibule Baw my grandmother saluted by her sons who wished her a happy holiday. Ludwig Lewisohn
    
    In keavenohitlse final clause is substantially longer than the two that precede it. Movement to a longer, more complicated famastruction is a refinement of the triadic sentence:
    
    The canisters were almost out of reach; made a motion to aid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if anyone attempted to assist him in counting his money. Emily Bronte
    
    Occasionally the shift may work in the opposite direction, from long to short:
    
    Calvin Coolidge believed that the least government was the best government; he aspired to become the least President the country ever had; he attained his desire. Irving stone
    
    The Cumulative Sentence
    
    Most commonly a cumulative sentence consists of an initial independent clause followed by a number of subordinate constructions which accumulate details about the person, place, event, or idea. Though the elements that come after the main clause are technically subordinate, they carry the main load of the sentence and are fully as important.
  - |-
    Cumulative sentences appear most often in description.
    The writer begins with a general picture, like an artist's char-
    coal sketch, then fills in the details:
    
    A creek ran through the meadow, winding and turning, clear water
    running between steep banks of black earth, with shallow places
    where you build a dam. Mark Schorer
    SENTENCE STYLES 169
    
    7000 Romaine St. looks itself like a faded movie exterior, a pastel
    building with chipped arte moderne detailing, the windows now
    either boarded up or paned with chicken-wire glass and, at the
    entrance, among the dusty oleander, a rubber mat that reads
    WELCOME. Joan Didion
    
    Cumulative sentences are also useful in character sketches:
    
    She [Anne Morrow Lindbergh] was then twenty-one, a year out of
    Smith College, a dark, shy, quiet girl with a fine mind and a small
    but pure and valuable gift for putting her thoughts and fancies,
    about the earth, sky, and sea, on paper. John Lardner
    
    Though less often used in narration, the cumulative sen-
    tence can also handle a series of events, as in this account of
    an English military expedition into France in 1359:
    
    The unwieldy provision carts, draught horses, and heavily armed
    knights kept the advance down to nine miles a day, the huge horde
    moving in three parallel columns, cutting broad highways of litter
    and devastation through an already abandoned countryside, many
    of the adventurers now traveling on foot, having sold their horses
    for bread or having slaughtered them for meat. John Gardner
    
    Like the freight-train style, the cumulative has the problem
    of being open-ended, without a natural stopping place. But
    the deficiency may be made good by artful construction. In
    the following example the writer, dedeoibargph of
    his parents, opens with the clause "When they sat for a pho-
    tograph together," follows this with accumulated details, and
    ends by assessing the meaning of the picture:
    
    When they sat for a photograph tegétbém—thadties,
  - |-
    The girl unsmiling and her eyes astare, elbows and knees tight,
    hands clenched in her lap, immaculate to the throat in lacy white,

    plete with stickpin, his arm around her with fingers outspread

    possessively upon her shasubdeerkiait not only of con-
    trasts, but of a nation's lower middle class coming out of its
    COCOOn. William Gibson
    
    What happens in that sentence is that the accumulation is
    gathered between dashes and intrudes into the middle of the
    main sentence ("When they sat for a photograph together ...
    it was a portrait not only of contrasts, but of a nation's lower
    middle class coming out of its cocoon"). That sentence be-
    comes a frame enclosing the details, a pattern nicely suited to
    what the sentence is about.
    
    Finally, there is another variety of the cumulative sentence,
    in which the order is reversed: the accumulated details precede
    the main clause instead of following it. In the following ex-
    ample a novelist, discussing her art, begins by listing the es-
    sentials of a story.
    
    Conflicts and rivalries and their resolutions, pride and its fate, es-
    trangement and reconciliation, revenge or forgiveness, quests and
    searches rewarded or unrewarded; abidingness versus change, love
    and its preafmehesthe constants, the themes of the
    
    Story. Elizabeth Bowen
    
    Notice how Bowen uses these to sum up all the preceding
    nouns and to act as the subject of the sentence. (These, this,
    that, those, and such are other pronouns which may be used
    in this way.)

    The Parallel Style

    stand in an identical grammatical relationship to the same
    thing. Yak and Jill went up the hill the Jactubpatts,

    parallel because both relate to the verb went. In the
    following sentence, the italicized clauses are parallel, both
    modifying the verb will come:
    
    We waithe when we are ready and when we choose.
    
    Parallelism occurs in all types of sentences as a way of or-
    ganizing minor constructions. When major ideas are involved,
    we speak of a parallel style, as in this sentence, where three
    parallel objects follow the preposition "in":
    
    Ints energy, its lyrics, its advocacy of frustrated joys, rock is one
    long symphony of protest. magazine Time
    
    And here, three infinitive phrases modifying the word
    "campaign":
    
    The Department of Justice began a vigorous campaign to break up
    
    the corporate empires, to restore the free and open market, and to
    
    plant the feet of the industry firmly on the road to competition.
    Thurman Arnold
    
    Parallel constructions are subject to a strict rule of style:
    they must be in the same grammatical form. Consider this
    opening of a sentence by the eighteenth-century political
    writer Edmund Burke:
    
    To complain of the age we live in, to murmur at the present pos-
    sessors of power, to lament the past, to conceive extravagant hopes
    of the future, are the common dispositions of the greatest part of
    mankind. ...
    
    According to the rule the four subjects of the verb are must
    be in the same grammatical form, and Burke has made them
    all infinitives. They could have been gerunds {complaining,
    murmuring, lamenting, conceiving) or nouns {complaints,
    murmurs, tameeztsjons). But in any case the point is
    that they must all be the same. To combine different forms
    would violate the eukrapfermixing an infinitive with
    a gerund (To complain of the age we live in, murmuring
    against the present possessors of power). Such awkward
    mixtures are called shifted constructions and are regarded as a
    serious breach of style, sloppy and often ambiguous.
    Extended parallelism is not a hallmark of modern writing,
    as it was in the eighteenth century, when the parallel style was
    predominant in formal prose. On the other hand it is foolish
    and unseeing to dismiss parallel sentences as out-of-date.
    They are still useful and by no means uncommon:
  - |-

    really see it, and describe what's going on out there.

    Advantages of Parallelism
    
    Parallel sentences have several advantages. First, they are im-
    pressive and pleasing to hear, elaborate yet rhythmic and or-
    dered, following a master plan with a place for everything and
    everything in its place.
    
    Second, parallelism is economical, using one element of a
    sentence to serve three or four others. Piling up several verbs
    after a single subject is probably the most common parallel
    pattern, as in the two examples just above. Paralleling verbs
    is particularly effective when describing a process or event.
    The sequence of the verbs analyzes the event and establishes
    its progress, and the concentration on verbs, without the re-
    current intervention of the subject, focuses the sentence on
    action. Here is an example, a description of prairie dogs, writ-
    ten by the American historian Francis Parkman:
    
    As the danger drew near they would wheel about, toss their heads
    in the air, and dive in a twinkling into their burrows.
    
    SENTENCE STYLES 173
    
    And another, an account of an invasion of Italy in 1494 by
    Charles VIII of France:
    
    Charles borrowed his way through Savoy, disappeared into the
    Alps, and emerged, early in September, at Asti, where his ally met
    him and escorted him to the suburbs. Ralph Roeder
    
    A third advantage of parallelism is its capacity to enrich
    meaning by emphasizing or revealing subtle connections be-
    tween words. For instance, in the example by Roeder the par-
    allelism hints at the harebrained nature of Charles's expedi-
    tion. Similarly Bernard Shaw, writing about Joan of Arc,
    insinuates a sardonic view of humanity below the surface of
    this prosaic summary of Joan's life:
    
    Joan of Arc, a village girl from the Wasgesrn about 1412,
    burnt for heresy, witchcraft, and sorcery in fef®bilitated after
    a fashion in 1456; designated venerable in d@@4yed Blessed
    in 1908; and finally canonized in 1920.
  - |-
    Of course, Shaw's irony is carried essentially by the words themselves, but the rapid parallel progression of the verbs enables us to see more easily the wickedness which human beings are capable, destroying a woman whom later they would deem saintly.
    
    The meaning reinforced by a parallel style does not have ironic. It can have any emotional or intellectual coloring.
    
    In the first of the following examples we can hear a sly amusement; in the second, anger; and in the third, eloquence:
    
    She laid two fingers on my shoulder, cast another look into my face under her candle, turned the key in the lock, gently thrust me beyond the door, shut it; and left me to my own devices.

    Limitations of Parallelism
    
    The parallel style handles ideas better than do the segregating or freight-train sentences. However, it suits only ideas that are logically parallel: several effects of the same cause, for instance, or three or four conditions of a single effect. When writers try to force parallelism onto ideas that are not logically parallel, they obscure rather than clarify meaning.
    
    A second disadvantage of the parallel style is that it seems a bit formal for modern taste. And a third is that parallelism can be wordy rather than economical if the style to dominate them, padding out ideas to make a parallel sentence, instead of making a parallel sentence to organize ideas.
    
    Yet despite these limitations parallelism remains an important resource of sentence style, one which many people neglect. It is a most effective way of ordering perceptions or ideas or feelings, of shaping a sentence, and of attaining economy and emphasis.

    The Balanced Sentence  
    
    A balanced sentence consists of two parts roughly equivalent  
    in both length and significance and divided by a pause:  
    SENTENCE STYLES 175  
    
    In a few moments everything grew black, and the rain poured down  
    like a Cataract. Francis Parkman  
    
    Balanced elements may repeat the same idea, show cause and  
    effect, precedence and subsequence, or any of other various  
    relationships. Often balanced sentences develop a contrast; when the contrast is sharply pointed it is called an antithesis.  
    
    While balance can involve any kind of clause or phrase, it  
    is most common with independent clauses, as in the example  
    above, or in these:  
    
    Visit either you like; they're both mad. Lewis Carroll  
    
    Children played about her; and she sang as she worked.  
    Rupert Brooke  
    
    These examples are compound sentences. Not all compound  
    sentences, however, are balanced, nor are all balanced sen-  
    tences compound. Balance requires simply that a sentence di-  
    vides into roughly equal halves on either side of a central  
    pause. This may occur even in a sentence that is not techni-  
    cally compound:  
    
    They read hardly at all, preferring to listen. George Gissing  
    
    Gissing's sentence is grammatically simple, the first half being  
    the main clause and the second a participial phrase. Even so,  
    it is balanced since the halves are about the same length (each  
    has six syllables) and equally important.  
    
    The examples thus far looked at exhibit elementary balance  
    
    between two units (——-+/That pattern, however,  
    
    may be varied in many ways. Sometimes one half is split again  
    
    1. Not everyone would agree to call such sentences balanced, arguing that  
    balanced constructions must be of the same grammatical order and therefore  
    that a balanced sentence requires that its halves be independent clauses. How-  
    ever, to the degree that we hear a sentence as consisting of two parts more or  
    less equal in length and importance, it is balanced. The balance is more exact

    Parallelism and Balance
    
    The difference between parallelism and balance is that in the
    former the elements involved must stand in an identical gram-
    matical relationship to the same word or construction. Bal-
    anced words or constructions, however, do not have to be
    parallel (though they can be). Thus in the sentence above by
    Defoe the six clauses are separate and independent, not related
    to anything.
    
    But parallelism and balance often go hand in hand, and
    nothing prevents the same constructions from being both par-
    allel and balanced, if they are performing an identical gram-
    matical function, are in the same form, and roughly equal in
    length. Here are two examples:
    
    As for me, frankly cleave to the Greeks and not to the Indians,
    and Aspire to be a rational animal rather than a pure spirit.
    George Santayana
    
    The sentence balances two coordinated clauses of similar
    structure and length. Within the first, the prepositional
    phrases "to the Greeks and not to the Indians" are parallel
    and antithetical. In the second clause "a rational animal rather
    than a pure spirit" is a parallel construction, and balance (in
    this case antithesis) is provided by playing "rational animal"
    against "pure spirit."
    
    Most people, of course, made no distinction between a Commu-
    niialiewebloin nothing but such philagovernment—and
    
    sophical anarchists as Weheeettlirwho government
    
    at all. Phil Strong
  - |-
    "A communist" and "such philosophical anarchists as Van-
    zetti" are parallel objects of "between," though the second is
    too much longer than the first to constitute a balance. How-
    ever, balance does occur in the two "who" clauses, though
    these are not parallel because they modify different nouns.
    
    The Advantages of Balance
    
    Balanced construction has several virtues. It is pleasing to our
    eyes and ears, and gives shape to the sentence, one of the
    essentials of good writing. It is memorable. And by playing
    key terms against each other, it opens up their implications.
    For example, the following sentence by Charles Dickens
    makes us consider the plight of those who lack the cash to
    turn their ideas to account:
    
    Talent, Mr. Micawber has; capital, Mr. Micawber has not.
    
    Anthony Hope implies a skeptical assessment of politicians
    and bureaucrats:
    
    Ability we don't expect in a government office, but honesty one
    might hope for.
    
    And here the movie critic Pauline Karelments on the film
    Love Story:
    178 THE SENTENCE
    
    In itself, a love idyll like this may seem harmless, but it won't be
    by itself very long.
    
    Keelislaint is that shlock films, if they are popular, usher
    in a host of even worse imitations. Notice how the sentence
    swings and advances on the phrases "in itself" and "by itself."
    Beyond highlighting specific words and ideas, balance has
    a deeper significance. It expresses a way of looking at the
    world, just as freight-train or cumulative sentences express
    their own angles of vision. Implicit in the balanced style is a
    sense of objectivity, control, and proportion. In the following
    passage about Lord Chesterfield, the critic F. L. Lucas rein-
    forces his argument by the reasonableness of his balanced sen-
    tences. The very style seems to confirm the fairness and lack
    of dogmatism suggested by such phrases as "seem to me" and
    "T think":
    
    In fine, there are things about Chesterfield that seem to me rather
    repellant; things that it is an offense in critics to defend. He is typ-
    ical of one side of the eighteenth weatusyitt-sféems to
  - |-
    Many its most typical side. But it does not seem to me the really
    good side of that century; and Chesterfield remains, #hink, less an
    example of things to pursue in life than of things to avoid.
    
    Because the balanced style keeps a distance between writer
    and suxspadts well for irony and comedy. For instance,
    the novelist Anthony Trollope implies humorous disapproval
    of a domineering female character in this way:
    
    It is not my intention to breathe a word against Mrs. Proudie, but
    still ¢annot think that with all her virtues she adds much to her
    husband's happiness.
    
    The balance suggests the objectivity of the author and in-
    creases the credibility of his criticism, while at the same time
    the second clause comically reveals him indulging in the very
    gossip he forswears in the first.
    SENTENCE STYLES 179
    
    Comic, too, is the effect of this sentence from the autobi-
    ography of Edward Gibbon, the historian of The Decline and
    Fall of the Roman Empire, which describes an unhappy love
    affair of his youth, broken off at his father's insistence:
    
    After a painful struggle yielded to my fate: sijhed as a lover, I
    obeyed as a son; my wound was insensibly healed by time, ab-
    sence, and the habits of a new life.
    
    Writing from the calmer waters of age, when the tempests of
    twenty seem less catastrophic, Gibbon is smiling. The very
    parallelism and balance of this triadic sentence, as formal as a
    minuet, are a comment on the passions of youth.
  - |-
    Balance and parallelism do not communicate meaning by themselves. The primary units of meaning, of course, are words. But balanced and parallel constructions do reinforce and enrich meaning. Or, to be more exact, certain kinds of meaning. Not every sentence can be cast in this mold, or should be. Like every style, parallelism and balance have limitations as well as potentialities. Their very sanity, reasonableness, and control make them unsuitable for conveying the immediacy of raw experience or the intensity of strong emotion. Moreover, their formality is likely to seem too elaborate to modern readers, a less "natural" way of writing than the segregating style or the freight-train or cumulative sentences.
    
    However, we ought not to equate formality with artificiality or to think naturalness the only ideal. All well-constructed sentences result from art, even those—perhaps especially those—that create the illusion of naturalness. Remember, too, that natural is a tricky word. To men and women of the eighteenth century, parallelism and balance reflected nature, which they understood as a vast but comprehensible structure of ordered parts.
    
    Perhaps the best lesson a modern writer can learn from the parallel and balanced styles is the necessity of giving shape to what he or she thinks and feels. The shape congenial to the eighteenth century seems unnatural to us. But while we no longer write like Thomas Jefferson or Samuel Johnson, we can still use parallelism and balance as ways of organizing some aspects of experience and knowledge, and as means of attaining economy, emphasis, and variety in our sentences.

  - |-
    Here are five balanced sentences composed with a subordinating style, similar to the examples provided:
    
    1. Although he was wealthy, he chose to live a simple life.  
    2. Because of the heavy rain, the game was canceled.  
    3. While she was tired, she continued working on the project.  
    4. If we had more time, we could have completed the task.  
    5. Since the weather was bad, we decided to stay indoors.
  - |-
    3. Convoluted structure: the main clause is split in two, opening and closing the sentence; the subordinate constructions intrude between the parts of the main clause.
    
    4. Centered structure: the main clause occupies the middle of the sentence and is both preceded and followed by subordinate constructions.
    
    The four patterns may be mixed in varying degrees and frequently are. Even so, it is probably true that most subordinate sentences follow one pattern or another.
    
    The Loose Sentence
    
    At its simplest the loose sentence contains a main clause plus a subordinate construction:
    
    We must always be wary of conclusions drawn from the ways of the social insects, since their evolutionary track lies so far from ours. Robert Ardrey
    
    The number of ideas in loose sentences is easily increased by adding phrases and clauses, related either to the main constructions or to a preceding subordinate one:
    
    | found a large hall, obviously a former garage, dimly lit, and packed with cots. Eric Hoffer
    
    I knew had found a friend in the woman, who herself was a lonely soul, never having known the love of man or child. Emma Goldman
    
    As the number of subordinate constructions increases, the loose sentence approaches the cumulative style (discussed on pages 124–125). It is possible to draw a line between loose and cumulative sentences. Indeed, cumulative sentences (or rather, most of them) are a special variety of the loose style. The difference is relative, depending on the length and weight of the subordinate constructions. In the cumulative sentence these take over, becoming more significant than the main clause, which serves primarily to introduce them. The following passage describing a Welsh town illustrates how loose structure evolves into a cumulative style:
    
    Lihangtepkiasantly, with its white cottages, and orchard and other trees, on the western slope of a green hill; looking far and wide over green meadows and little or bigger hills, in the pleasant plain of Glamorgan; a short mile to the south of Cowbridge, to which smart little town it is properly a kind of suburb.
    
    Thomas Carlyle
  - |-
    Loose sentences are appropriate for writing that aims to be colloquial, informal, relaxed. It puts first things first, as most of us do when we talk. On the other hand, loose structure lacks emphasis and easily becomes formless. Its unity derives not so much from a structural principle as from the coherence of thought. A loose sentence is well formed to the degree that it expresses a completed idea or perception. A good example is the following passage, which begins a description of the Brooklyn home belonging to the writer's grandmother:
    
    Her house was a narrow brownstone, two windows to every floor except the ground, where the place of one window was taken by a double door of solid walnut plated with layers of dust-pocked cheap enamel. gtsallow stoop.... William Alfred
    
    Alfred's sentence is unified by what it thesattbes—the
    
    of the house. When that perception ends and our eyes are turned upon the stoop, the writer wisely begins a new sen-
    tence. Of course, this question of when to stop, of knowing when one statement should end and another begin, applies to all kinds of sentences. But it causes special problems with loose structure, where the absence of a clear stopping place may tempt you to ramble on and on.
    
    The Periodic Sentence
    
    Periodic sentences reverse the pattern of loose structure, be-
    ginning with subordinate constructions and putting the main
    clauses at the end:
    
    If there is no future for the black ghetto, the future of all Negroes
    is diminished. Stanley Sanders
    
    Given a moist planet with methane, formaldehyde, ammonia, and
    some usable minerals, all of which abound, exposed to lightning
    or ultraviolet radiation at the right temperature, life might start al-
    most anywhere. Lewis Thomas
    
    There is no one formula for the periodic sentence. Often,
    however, the opening subordinate constructions are adverbial
    clauses, as in the example by Stanley Sanders, or participial
    phrases, as in that by Lewis Thomas.
  - |-
    Whatever kinds of subordination it uses, the periodic style  
    is emphatic. Delaying the principal thought increases its im-  
    portance. To the degree that more and more subordinate  
    clauses and phrases are accumulated at the beginning, further  
    postponing the main clause, the sense of climax increases  
    (within limits, of course; too long a delay will cause confu-  
    sion). Here is an instance of effectively postponing the main  
    point:  
    
    Paralyzed by the neurotic lassitude engendered by meeting one's  
    past at every turn, around every corner, inside every cupboard, go  
    aimlessly from room to room. Joan Didion  
    
    The periodic style is also more formal and literary than the  
    loose, suggesting a writer at a desk rather than a speaker in a  
    relaxed social setting, a tone advantageous on formal occa-  
    sions, though less so when informality is desired.  
    
    The Convoluted Sentence  
    
    In this type of periodic structure the subordinate elements  
    split the main clause from the inside, often intruding between  
    the subject and the verb and sometimes between verb and  
    object or within the verb phrase:  
    
    White men, at the bottom of their hearts, Know this.  
    James Baldwin  
    
    And once in a spasm of reflex chauvinism, she called Queen Vic-  
    toria, whom she rather admired, "a goddamned old water dog."  
    William Alfred  
    
    Convoluted structure, as an occasional rather than habitual  
    style, is a good way of achieving variety in sentence move-  
    ment. It establishes strong emphasis by throwing weight  
    upon the words before and after the commas or dashes setting  
    off the interrupting constructions:  
    
    Now demons, whatever else they may be, are full of interest.  
    Lytton Strachey  
    
    Here both "demons" and "full of interest" draw attention,  
    expressing the principal idea more strongly than would loose  
    or periodic structure:  
    
    Now demons are full of interest, whatever else they may be.  
    
    Whatever else they may be, demons are full of interest.  
    
    However, this fact does not mean that the convoluted style is  
    inherently better than either the periodic or the loose. It is  
    simply a convenient way of establishing emphasis on partic-  
    ular words when that emphasis is desirable.
  - |-
    On the other hand, convoluted structure is formal, and it  
    can tax readers' attention, especially as the interrupting ele-  
    ments grow longer and more complicated:
    
    Even the humble ambition, which long cherished, of making  
    sketches of those places which interested me, from a defect of eye  
    or of hand was totally ineffectual. Sir Walter Scott
    
    The life story to be told of any creative worker is therefore by its  
    very nature, by its diversion of purpose and its qualified success,  
    by its grotesque transitions from sublimation to base necessity and  
    its pervasive stress towards flight, a comedy. H. c. Wells
    
    These are good sentences, carefully articulated and precise;  
    but they are not easy to read. They demand attention; readers  
    must recognize when a construction is suspended and when  
    it is resumed and be able to put the pieces together. Used  
    sparingly, the long convoluted sentence has the virtue of the  
    unusual: it draws attention to itself and, more important, to  
    what it says, and it can challenge and stimulate the reader. A  
    186 THE SENTENCE
    
    steady diet of such challenges, however, very soon grows  
    tiresome.
    
    The Centered Sentence
    
    The type of subordinate structure that places the main clause  
    more or less in the middle of the sentence, with subordinate  
    elements on either side, has no common name. It has been  
    called "circuitous" and "round composition"; we shall say  
    "centered." Whatever we call it, we see it often. (In the three  
    examples that follow in this section, the main clauses have  
    been italicized.)
    
    Having wanted to walk on the sea like St. Peter he had taken an  
    involuntary bath, losing his mitre and the better part of his  
    reputation. Lawrence Durrell
    
    Standing on the summit of the tower that crowned his church,  
    wings upspread, sword lifted, the devil crawling beneath, and the  
    cock, symbol of eternal vigilance, perched on his mailed foot, Saint  
    Michael held a place of his own in heaven and on earth which  
    seems, in the eleventh century, to leave hardly room for the Virgin  
    ofthe Crypt at Gtilattesfor the Beau Christ of the thirteenth  
    century at Amiens. Henry Adams
  - |-
    While not as emphatic as periodic or as informal as loose construction, the centered style has several advantages, especially in long sentences with numerous subordinate elements. It enables a writer to place those elements more clearly. If half-a-dozen or more phrases and dependent clauses all precede the main construction (as in the periodic style), or all follow it (as in the loose), some may seem to float free. The link becomes obscure, especially when writing about ideas. The chance of obscurity is reduced if the main clause can be placed in the middle of the subordinate elements.
    
    Another advantage of the centered sentence is that it is easier to arrange sentence elements to reflect the natural order of the event or the ideas. Jonathan Swift does exactly this in the following passage criticizing England's participation in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714):
    
    After ten years' fighting to little purpose, after the loss of above a hundred thousand men, and a debt remaining of twenty millions, we at length hearkened to the terms of peace, which was concluded with great advantage to the empire and to Holland, but none at all to us, and clogged soon after with the famous treaty of partition.

    Allowed a broad and uncritical meaning of "idea," we may
    say that Swift's sentence contains nine of them: (1) the "ten
    years' fighting"; (2) the "little purpose," or lack of result; (3)
    the "loss" of the men; (4) the "debt remaining"; (5) the "hear-
    kening" to peace; (6) the conclusion of the peace; (7) the "ad-
    vantages" that followed for England's allies; (8) the absence
    of such advantages for England herself; and (9) the "clogging"
    of the peace. Here the order of the sentence mirrors events.
    In reality, as in the sentence, the fighting comes first, then the
    absence of positive results, the loss of life, the debt, and so
    on. Effecting a workable compromise between the natural or-
    der of thought or of events on the one hand, and the gram-
    matical order of the sentence on the other, is one of the most
    difficult tasks a writer faces. When you are dealing with a long
    and complicated subject, the centered sentence may prove the
    easiest solution to the problem.
    
    The Fragment
    
    A fragment is a single word, a phrase, or a dependent clause
    standing alone as a sentence. It is considered fragmentary
    rather than a grammatical sentence because it is not gram-
    matically independent and may not contain a subject and a
    finite verb. In formal writing fragments are generally a fault,
    though occasionally valuable for emphasis or variety. Before
    looking at examples of such positive fragments, we need to
    understand the common forms that fragments may take and
    how, when they are a fault rather than a virtue, they may be
    corrected.
    
    As an instance of a single-word fragment, consider this an-
    swer to a question:
    
    Do you understand?
    
    Perfectly.
    
    If we were to see the word perfectly printed all by itself, we
    should be puzzled. We know what the word means, but com-
    pletely isolated it makes no sense. It is not grammatically
    meaningful. Of course we rarely encounter words in such
    utter isolation. Usually they occur in the context of other
    words (or of clarifying social situations), and we can easily
    supply what is needed to complete the meaning:
    
    [| understand] perfectly.
  - |-
    Fragments in composition are less likely to be single words than phrases or clauses, usually modifiers detached from the words they modify. Three very common cases are the participial phrase, the adjectival clause, and the adverbial clause; each is italicized in the examples below:
    
    DETACHED PARTICIPIAL PHRASE: saw ler. Going down the street.
    
    DETACHED ADJECTIVAL CLAUSE: Everyone left except John. Who decided to stay.
    
    DETACHED ADVERBIAL CLAUSE: It was very late. When the party broke up.
    
    Awkward fragments such as these can be fixed in one of two ways. Either the fragment may be made part of the sentence where it acts as a modifier:
    
    I saw her going down the street.
    Everyone left except John, who decided to stay.
    It was very late when the party broke up.
    
    SENTENCE STYLES 189
    
    Or, the fragment may be kept as a separate statement but made grammatically complete, either by removing the word or words which render it subordinate or by supplying, if necessary, a subject and verb:
    
    I saw her. She was going down the street.
    Everyone left except John. He decided to stay.
    It was very late. The party broke up.
    
    Though these alternative corrections result in grammatical sentences, they have slight differences in meaning. ("Slight" differences in meaning are often the difference between good and mediocre writing.) Turning the fragment into a complete sentence gives it more emphasis.
    
    A final type of fragment is the verbless statement:
    
    All people, whether they live in the city or the country.
    
    Here modifiers surround a noun ("people"). But this noun, presumably the intended subject of a sentence, has no verb; the writer never predicates anything about "people." Cases like this may require more extensive revision. Sometimes, if the noun is followed by a modifying clause, the verb of the clause may be adapted as the main verb:
    
    All people live in the city or the country.
    
    In this instance, the correction is too simpleminded to be what the writer intended. He or she needs to think out the idea and supply an appropriate predication, perhaps something like:
    
    All people, whether they live in the city or the country, want the conveniences of modern life.
    
    Effective Fragments
  - |-
    Fragments are very likely to be awkward and unclear when they are unintended, the result of carelessness or uncertainty  
    about what a grammatical sentence is. But used skillfully, they are eye-catching, unusual, and emphatic:  
    
    "Many a man," said Speer, "has been haunted by the nightmare that one day nations might be dominated by technical means. That nightmare was almost realized in Hitler's totalitarian system." Al-  
    most, but not quite. Huxley Aldous  
    
    Sweeping criticism of this tapehdiker criticism—throws  
    less light on the subject than on the critic himself. A light not always  
    impressive. F. L Lucas  
    
    Obviously, the effectiveness of fragments like these de-  
    pends upon their being uncommon. It is best, then, to employ  
    fragments very occasionally in formal composition, and only  
    when you wish to draw attention to the idea they express.  
    
    For Practice  
    
    [> Which of the following statements are fragments? Revise them  
    in two ways: first by turning the fragment into a grammatically com-  
    plete sentence in its own right, and second by incorporating it into  
    a sentence within which it serves as a modifier:  
    
    1. In the morning when the sun came up. The party broke camp.  
    
    2. Most people are honest. Making an effort, for example, to find  
    the owner of a wallet they picked up on a busy street.  
    
    3. That girl is very nice. The one you introduced me to.  
    
    4. School is not so difficult. If you don't let your work pile up.  
    
    5. Not everyone likes football. My brother, for instance.  
    
    6. Older people who lived through the Depression and the Second  
    World War. And experienced great changes in our society.  
    
    7. The boy climbing the tree. That's my cousin.  
    
    8. Although he wasn't at fault. Everybody blamed him.  
    
    9. That man running down the street. He stole this lady's purse.

    The Well-Written Sentence:  
    (1) Concision
  - |-
    Aside from being grammatical, a well-written sentence must be clear and interesting. Clarity means that it says to the reader what the writer intended to say; interesting, that it reads well, attracting us by its economy, novelty, sound, and rhythm. To a considerable degree these virtues are a matter of diction, that is, of word choice; and in the section on diction we shall look at them again from that point of view. But they also depend on sentence structure. In this chapter and the next we consider how sentence structure in itself contributes to clarity and interest. It does so by aiming at concision, emphasis, rhythm, and variety.
    
    Concision is brevity relative to purpose. It is not to be confused with absolute brevity. A sentence of seven words is brief; but if the idea can be conveyed with equal clarity in fewer words, it is not concise. On the other hand, a sentence of fifty words is in no sense brief, but it is concise if the point can be made in no fewer words. Observing a few general rules of sentence construction will help you avoid certain kinds of wordiness.
    
    192 THE SENTENCE
    
    > Do Not Waste the Main Elements
    of the Sentence
    
    (In these and all following examples, the headword—that the unnecessary words are...)
    
    WORDY The fact of the war had the effect of causing many changes.
    CONCISE The war caused many changes.
    
    The main elements of a sentence are its subject, verb, and object. They should convey the core of the thought. Suppose we abstract subject, verb, and object from the sentences above:
    
    fact had effect
    war caused changes
    
    Clearly the thwisibalfilesslength of the original sentences is more efficient: from "war caused changes" a reader quickly grasps the nub of the idea. But who could guess the writer's point from "fact had effect"?
    
    As you compose a sentence, then, get the essence of the thought into the subject, verb, and object. Not doing so often results from uncertainty about what your subject is. A sentence that starts out on the wrong foot will stagger under a load of excess verbiage as you struggle to get at what you mean:
  - |-
    The first baseman wears a special leather glove that is designed for easy scooping and long-range catching, while the catcher wears a large glove that is heavily padded to protect him from fast pitches.
    
    The subject of the first clause is "the first baseman"; of the second, "the catcher." But these are the wrong subjects: the writer is contrasting the gloves, not the players. If the true
    
    (1) CONCISION 193
    
    subject ("glove") is used, the sentence steps off properly and
    moves along easily:
    
    The first baseman's glove is designed for easy scooping and long-
    range catching, while the catcher's is large and heavily padded to
    protect him from fast pitches.
    
    Awkward Anticipatory Construction
    
    This is a special case of failing to use the main sentence ele-
    ments effectively:
    
    WORDY This is the kind of golfer that is called a hacker.
    CONCISE _ This kind of golfer is called a hacker.
    
    In an anticipatory sentence the notional mybyéett—that
    
    the sentence is really abowhe-grammatical subject.
    
    Instead it is introduced (or "anticipated") by a pronoun (it,
    this, that, these, those, there) which functions as the gram-
    matical subject. (The tbedtifeonstrgction
    
    matically but for all practical purposes works the same way.)
    A verb like is, are, or seems links the notional subject to the
    pronoun, and an adjectival phrase or clause, modifying the
    notional subject, tells us what is being predicated about it:
    
    This is the man who witnessed the accident.
    There are many property owners who object to new schools.
    
    Those are the people from Chicago.
    
    Anticipatory constructions require more words than com-
    parable direct statements. Sometimes the construction is le-
    gitimized by emphasis or idiom; then the extra words are cer-
    tainly not deadwood. But unless there is such a purpose, a
    direct statement is preferable. Seems and its close relative
    appears are especially frequent in awkward anticipatory
    
    TQ4NTENCE THE
    
    sentences. Some writers, whether excessively cautious or po-
    lite, habitually hedge their bets, preferring a hesitant claim like
    
    It seems that this professor did not prepare his lectures very well.
    to the bolder assertion:
    This professor did not prepare his lectures very well.
  - |-
    Regarding any anticipatory construction, then, ask yourself whether idiom or emphasis justifies it. Sometimes one or the other will. Changing "It is true that we did not like the idea at first" to "That we did not like the idea at first is true" saves one word but results in a stiff sentence, too formal for many occasions. Similarly, revising "This is the man who witnessed the accident" to "This man witnessed the accident" de-emphasizes the point, hardly an improvement when one wants to make a strong statement. But sometimes you will find that no such reason justifies an anticipatory construction. Then it is simply wordy, and you ought to replace it with a more direct statement.

    Adverbs and adjectives ought to link as directly as possible
    with what they modify. The writers of the first examples
    above are afraid of adverbs. (Many people are, perhaps made
    timid by uncertainty about the ending.) "Unnatural" re-
    ally describes "acted," but instead of directly connecting it to
    that verb, the writer hangs it on the empty word "way" in an
    unnecessary prepositional phrase. Similarly, the adverbial
    phrase "in a brief statement" can be rendered with equal clar-
    ity and far more economy by "briefly." The other three sen-
    tences labor under ponderous adjectival phrases or clauses
    when much briefer construction will do.

    CONCISE It leaves us thinking that we were hasty.
    WORDY This is the idea that was suggested last week.
    CONCISE This is the idea suggested last week.
    
    Wordy modification often results from failing to use participle.
    In cases like the first example an abstract noun
    ("thought"), which requires a preposition and an article, can
    be replaced by one word, "thinking." The second example
    here shows how to prune an adjectival clause consisting of a
    relative word ("that") + a linking verb ("was") + a participle
    ("suggested") or other predicative term. By dropping the rel-
    ative word and the linking verb, you can move directly from
    the noun to the participle (or predicative word).
    
    Sometimes an entire adverbial clause can be cut back to the
    operative participle.
    
    WORDY Because they were tired, the men returned to camp.

    CONCISE Riots became frequent.

    CONCISE Mr. Martin is quiet, patient, and cautious.
    WORDY The day was a perfect one.
    
    CONCISE The day was perfect.
    
    A predicate adjective stands after the noun it notionally mod-
    ifies, connected to it by a linking verb (is, are, was, were,
    seems, becomes, and so on), like "large" in this sentence:
    
    The house is large.
    An attributive adjective stands before the noun it modifies:
    the large house
  - |-
    Predicate adjectives are not necessarily better. But it is bet-
    ter not to restate a word or idea pointlessly as the above ex-
    amples do. "Affairs," "person," and "one" are empty words,
    hooks on which to hang an attributive adjective. Why not use
    the adjective predicatively? Then the empty word is no longer
    (1) CONCISION 197
    
    needed. And even more important, the adjective will get the
    emphasis it deserves.

    WORDY Pitchers are divided into two classes. These classes are
    starters and relievers.
    
    CONCISE Pitchers are divided into two abatses—starters
    relievers.
    
    In sentences like these, the colon or dash says: "Here comes
    a series of particulars." If you let the punctuation mark talk,
    you won't need deadwood like "which include" or "these
    classes are." (The only difference between the colon and the
    dash in this function is that the colon is a bit more formal.
    However, each mark has other, very different tasks in which
    they are not equivalents.)
    
    The colon or dash can also set up an important idea delayed
    for emphasis:
    
    WORDY But a counterforce has been established within the

    squad.

  - |-
    An ellipsis (plural, ellipses) is the omission of words implied
    by the grammar but not necessary to complete the sense. The
    writer using an ellipsis assumes that readers can supply the
    missing words from the context.
    
    Ellipses often secure concision with no loss of clarity or
    emphasis. They may even enhance those qualities. In the first
    example above, the sense does not require the second "is";
    moreover, the revision allows the sentence to end on the key
    term "brother." In the second, the concise version stresses
    "late" and avoids repeating "you"; while in the third, drop-
    ping "lost" from the second clause makes a striking
    statement.
    
    The unusual quality of some ellipses, however, limits their
    usefulness. For example, "He lost his wallet; she, her pock-
    etbook" has a literary flavor that might seem odd in a matter-
    of-fact, colloquial passage.
    
    Use Parallelism
    
    WORDY These books are not primarily for reading, but they are
    used for reference.
    
    CONCISE These books are not primarily for reading but for
    reference.
    
    WORDY The beginner must work more slowly, and he must
    work more consciously.
    
    CONCISE The beginner must work more slowly and more
    consciously.
    
    Parallelism means that two or more words, phrases, or
    clauses are grammatically related in the same way to the same
    thing. In "The man and the boy came in together," "man"
    and "boy" are parallel because each acts as a subject of the
    same verb ("came in"). Or in "She stood and raised her
    hand," "stood" and "raised" are parallel because each is a
    verb of the same subject ("She").
    
    Parallelism is like factoring in mathematics; instead of re-
    peating an +2aay + az, the mathematician writes a(2x
    + 3y + z). In a grammatically parallel construction the gov-
    erning term need not be stated two or three times. In the first
    example, the phrase "for reference," by being made parallel
    to "for reading," does duty for the entire second clause.
  - |-
    But at times parallelism improves nothing. Emphasis or
    rhythm often justifies a certain amount of repetition. Thus in
    the second example above, the so-called "wordy" version
    would be preferable if the writer wished to stress "he must
    work."
    
    CHAPTER :
    
    The WalbiWeitten
    (2) Emphasis
    
    In speech we achieve emphasis in a variety of ways: by talking
    loudly (or sometimes very softly); by speaking slowly, care-
    fully separating words that ordinarily we run together; by
    altering our tone of voice or changing its timbre. We also
    stress what we say by nonvocal means: a rigid, uncompro-
    mising posture; a clenched fist; a pointing finger; any of nu-
    merous other body attitudes, gestures, facial expressions.
    
    Writers can rely upon none of these signals. Yet they too
    need to be emphatic. What they must do, in effect, is to trans-
    late loudness, intonation, gesture, and so on, into writing.
    Equivalents are available. Some are merely visual symbols for
    things we do when talking: much punctuation, for example,
    stands for pauses in speech. Other devices, while not un-
    known in speech, belong primarily to composition. Some of
    these we shall look at in this chapter.
    
    First, though, we need to distinguish two degrees of em-
    pumapisasitotatich applies to the entire sentence,
    gnudtial emphasis, which applies only to a word, or a group
    of words, within the sentence. As an example of total em-
    phasis, consider these two statements:
    
    1An old man sat in the corner.
    2. In the corner sat an old man.
    
    (2) EMPHASIS 201
    
    Sentence (1) is matter of fact, attaching no special importance
    to what it tells us. Sentence (2), however, like a close-up in a
    film, suggests that the fact is important. Now this distinction
    does not mean that the second version is superior to the first:
    simply that it is more emphatic. Whether or not the emphasis
    makes it better depends on what the writer wants to say.

    By their nature strong sentences (that is, those having total emphasis) cannot occur very often. Their effectiveness depends on their rarity. Writing in which every sentence is emphatic, or even every other, is like having somebody shout at you.
    
    Partial emphasis (emphasis within the sentence), however, is characteristic of all well-written sentences. Usually one word (or phrase or clause) is more important than the others. Consider these two variations of the same statement:
    
    1. It suddenly began to rain.
    2. Suddenly, it began to rain.
    
    If we suppose that the writer wished to draw our attention to "suddenly," sentence (2) is better. By moving it to the opening position and isolating it with a comma, the writer gives the word far more weight than it has in sentence (1). Again there is no question of an absolute better or worse. Each version is well-suited to some purpose, ill-suited to others.
    
    The Emphatic Sentence
    
    There are a number of ways of stressing a statement in its totality.
    
    > Announcement
    
    An announcement (in the sense it has here) is a preliminary statement which tells the reader, "Watch out, here comes something important": \
    202 THE SENTENCE
    
    Finally, last point about the man: he is in trouble.
    Benjamin DeMott
    
    The construction receiving the stress should be phrased concisely and vigorously and separated from the preceding announcement by a colon or dash (though sometimes a comma will do).
    
    Anticipatory constructions, which we saw on page 141 as a potential source of deadwood, can function effectively as a form of announcement. They are low-key, reducing the introduction to little more than a pronoun (or there) + a verb:
    
    This was the consequence we feared. Evelyn Jones
    
    It is abalgig—ethtsuman beings to understand each Other. Joy Packer
    
    The Fragment
    
    A fragment is a construction which, like a sentence, begins with a capital and ends with full-stop punctuation, but which does not satisfy the traditional definition of a sentence.' While they are often serious grammatical faults, fragments can be used positively as a means of emphatic statement, drawing attention because of their difference:
    
    And that's why there's really a very simple answer to our original question.

    The Short Sentence
    
    Short sentences are inherently emphatic. They will seem es-
    pecially strong in the context of longer, more complicated
    statements. Often the contrast in length reinforces the con-
    trast in thought:
    
    As Thompson and the Transcript man had said, Vanzetti was nat-
    urally and quietly eloquent. So he was electrocuted. Phil strong
    
    Again, it's an incontrovertible fact that, in the past, when contra-
    ceptive methods were unknown, women spent a much larger pro-
    portion of a much shorter life pregnant, or nursing infants whom
    they had borne with little or no medical help. And don't believe
    that that's a natural, a healthy thing for human beings to do, just
    because animals do it. itn't. , Elizabeth Janeway
    
    The Imperative Sentence
    At its simplest the imperative sentence is a command:
    
    Come here!
    Listen to me!
    
    Its distinguishing fhatuitedrayssally-suib-
    ject and begins with the verb, although some commands use
    a noun of address or an actual subject:
    
    John, come here!
    You listen to me!
    
    While commands are rare in composition, imperative sen-
    tences can be emphatic in other ways:
    
    Insist on yourself; never imitate. Ralph Waldo Emerson
    
    Let us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown
    off the track by every nutshell and mosquito's wing that falls on the
    rails. Henry David Thoreau
    
    204 THE SENTENCE
    
    Consider, for example, those skulls on the monuments.
    . Aldous Huxley
    
    Aside from being strong, imperative sentences also link
    writer and reader. Emerson does not say "men and women
    must insist on themselves"; he addresses you. Thoreau urges
    you to participate in a new way of life, and Huxley invites
    you to look with him at the statuary he is examining. Huxley's
    sentence also illustrates another use of the imperative: moving
    readers easily from one point to another.
    
    The Inverted Sentence
  - |-
    Inversion means putting the main elements of a sentence in  
    an order other than subject-verb-object. Some patterns of in-  
    version signal questions ("Are you going into town today?");  
    some signal condition contrary to fact ("Had I only been  
    there"). Other inversional patterns indicate emphasis. The  
    most frequent is the sentence that opens with an adverbial  
    word or phrase (to which further modification may be at-  
    tached) and follows it with the verb and subject:  
    
    And in one corner, book-piled like the rest of the furniture, stood a  
    piano. Kenneth Grahame  
    
    Less commonly, emphatic inversion follows the pattern  
    object-subject-verb:  
    
    Wrangles he avoided, and disagreeable persons he usually treated  
    with a aotdfreezing contempt. Douglas Southall Freeman  
    
    Inversions are tricky, subject to subtle conventions of idiom,  
    too numerous and complex to bother with here. If you aren't  
    sure whether a particular inverted sentence will work, read it  
    out loud and trust your ear. If it sounds un-English, it prob-  
    ably is.  
    (2) EMPHASIS 205  
    
    The Interrupted Sentence  
    
    Normally a sentence moves from subject to verb to comple-  
    ment. Interruption breaks that flow by inserting construc-  
    tions between the main elements and forcing pauses. As we  
    shall see later in this chapter, interruption is an important  
    means of emphasizing particular words. But it can also render  
    an entire statement emphatic:  
    
    And finally, stammering a crude farewell, he departed.  
    Thomas Wolfe  
    
    The sentence could be expressed straightforwardly:  
    And he finally departed, stammering a crude farewell.  
    
    But while more natural, the revision is weaker. (Not therefore  
    "poorer"; it depends on purpose.)  
    
    Interrupted movement makes demands on the reader, es-  
    pecially when the interrupting constructions grow numerous  
    and long. But kept reasonably short and simple, interruption  
    is an effective technique of emphasis.  
    
    The Periodic Sentence  
    
    A periodic sentence (sometimes called a suspended sentence)  
    does not complete its main thought until the end:  
    
    If you really want to be original, to develop your own ideas in your  
    own way, then maybe you shouldn't go to college. student  
    
    It differs from a loose sentence, which places its main clause  
    at the beginning and then adds subordinate ideas:
  - |-
    Maybe you shouldn't go to college if you really want to be original,
    to develop your own ideas in your own way.
    
    206 THE SENTENCE
    
    Periodic sentences can be constructed in various ways.
    Many are built by beginning the sentence with adverbials, like
    the fifth example above. Others start off with a
    noun clause:
    
    That John Chaucer was only an assistant seems certain.
    John Gardner
    
    That the author of Everyman was no mere artist, but an artist-
    philosopher, and that the artist-philosophers are the only sort of
    artists like seriously bevilb news to you.
    
    George Bernard Shaw
    
    However they are constructed, periodic sentences make
    stronger statements than do loose, requiring that we pay at-
    tention and suspend understanding until the final words pull
    everything together. But this type of sentence has limitations.
    It quickly grows tiresome, for the alertness it demands wea-
    ries readers. Furthermore, periodic structure has a formal, lit-
    erary tone, unsuitable for informal occasions. Yet despite
    these limitations an occasional periodic sentence supplies val-
    uable emphasis and has the further advantage of varying your
    style.
    
    The Rhestidcl
    
    In discussing paragraphs (page 68) we saw that rhetorical
    questions can serve as topic sentences. They can also establish
    emphasis. Most emphatic rhetorical questions are, in effect,
    disguised assertions:
    
    A desirable young man? Dust and ashes! What was there desirable
    in sink that? Strachey Lytton
    
    The question says, of course, that he was not desirable
    young man."
    
    Some emphatic questions are more complicated in mean-
    ing, combining an implicit avowal with an actual query:
    
    (2) EMPHASIS 207
    
    Yet this need not be. The means are at hand to fulfill the age-old
    dream: poverty can be abolished. How long shall we ignore this
    under-developed nation in our midst? How long shall we look the
    other way while our fellow human beings suffer? How long?
    Michael Harrington
    
    Even here, however, Harrington is trying not so much to
    elicit an answer as he is to convince us that allowing poverty
    to continue is indefensible. (Notice, incidentally, that each of
    those two examples also contains other kinds of emphatic
    statement: short sentences, fragments, repetitions.)
    
    Negative-Positive Restatement
  - |-
    Here emphasis is achieved by stating an idea twice, first in negative terms, then in positive:
    
    Color is not a human or personal reality; it is a political reality.
    James Baldwin
    
    This is more than poetic insight; it is hallucination. c. J. — Furnas
    
    The poor are not like everyone else. They are a different kind of
    people. They think and feel differently; they look upon a different
    America than the middle class looks upon. Michael Harrington
    
    Generally the same sentence contains both the negative and
    the positive statements (as in the first examples here). In
    an extended passage, negative and positive may be expressed
    in separate sentences (the third example).
    
    Less commonly the progression may be from positive to
    negative, as in this sentence by G. K. Chesterton about social
    conventions:
    
    Conventions may be cruel, they may be unsuitable, they may even
    be grossly superstitious or obscene, but there is one thing they never
    are. Conventions are never dead.
    
    All this could be put more briefly:
    
    208 . THE SENTENCE
    
    Although conventions may be cruel, unsuitable, or even grossly
    superstitious or obscene, they are never dead.
    
    But not put so well.
    
    Rhythm and Rhyme
    
    Rhymers—phrasal and unstressed syllables—are an inevitable aspect of prose, though rarely as regular or as obvious as in poetry. Since rhythm of some sort is
    inescapable, good writers are aware of it and make it work
    for them. Later, in Chapter 22, we shall look at prose rhythm
    a bit more closely, considering how it is controlled and how
    it contributes to meaning. One contribution we touch upon
    here is the most common ways in which
    rhythm conveys emphasis are by clustered stresses and metrical runs.
    
    A stressed syllable is spoken relatively loudly, an unstressed
    one more softly. Stressed syllables are marked by /, unstressed
    by x, as in
    
    above.
    
    A metrical run consists of a number of stressed and unstressed
    syllables recurring in a more or less regular pattern. This, of
    course, is common in poetry, but much less so in prose.
    
    Clustered Stresses
    
    x i i i x x i
    The Big Bull Market was dead. Frederick Lewis Allen
  - |-
    xX / x / / xX 7 od /
    He speaks and thinks plain, broad, downright, English.
    William Hazlitt
    
    Clustering stresses simply means constructing a sentence so
    that three or four or more stressed syllables occur successively. Obviously such clustering cannot be extensive or frequent. Done skillfully, as in the examples above, it endows
    an idea with considerable importance. It can also contribute
    to meaning in subtle ways. For example, the rhythm of Al-
    len's sentence reinforces the sense of unalterable finality con-
    veyed by "dead."
    
    Metrical Runs
    
    / ix
    For one brief moment the world was nothing but sight-ttie
    x xf
    sound, the sneelbuch, the taste of sea. Sheila Kaye-Smith
    
    The rhythmic regularity of that sentence not only makes it
    memorable but also enhances the emotional intensity of the
    experience.
    
    Like clustered stresses, metrical runs cannot be maintained
    for very long or employed very often. Otherwise prose begins
    to sound awkwardly poetic. It is a mistake, however, to sup-
    pose that such passages have no place in prose, that prose
    must avoid any rhythmic effects at all. As we suggested,
    rhythm is always there, but it should be unobtrusive, direct-
    ing a reader's response, but without drawing attention to
    itself.
    
    Rhyme
    
    Rhyme, the repetition of identical or very similar sounds, is,
    like rhythm, a technique we associate more with poetry than
    with prose. When it does occur in prose it is usually a way of
    emphasizing particular words within the sentence (we shall
    see examples later in the chapter). Occasionally, however,
    rhyme serves to unify and emphasize an entire sentence, most
    commonly in the form of alliteration (the repetition of suc-
    cessive or near-successive initial sounds):
    
    Reason will be replaced by Revelation. w. H. Auden
    210 THE SENTENCE
    
    Emphasis Within the Sentence
    
    Emphatic sentences are only occasionally needed. But it is
    usually necessary to establish appropriate emphasis upon par-
    ticular words within the sentence. Good writers do this sub-
    tly. Rather than scattering exclamation points, underlinings,
    and capitals, they rely chiefly upon the selection and posi-
    tioning of words.

    Important source of emphasis. A special class
    
    called intensives do nothing but stress the term they modify:
    great, gxtuthyely, much, very, terribly, awfully, and
    
    many, many more. But on the whole intensives are not very
    satisfactory. They quickly become devalued, leading to a
    never-ending search for fresh words. Imaginative writers can
    and do discover unusual and effective ones, as in this descrip-
    tion of the modern superstate:
    
    These goalocinese monstrous states ... Susanne K. Langer
    
    Still it is best not to rely upon intensives as a primary device
    of emphasis.
    
    Pairing and Piling Modifiers
    
    As we shall see in a few pages, adjectives and adverbs can be
    made emphatic by where they are placed and how they are
    punctuated. But aside from that, they may be paired and piled
    up (that is, grouped in units of two or of three or more). Here
    are a few instances of paired modifiers:
    
    They [a man's children] are his for a brief and passing season.
    Margaret Mead
    
    This antiquated and indefensible notion that young people have no
    rights trtjlare ... twenty-one Evelyn Jones
    
    (2) EMPHASIS 211
    
    [Lady Mary Wontkeyue was like] a dilapidated macaw with
    
    a hard, piercing laugh, mirthless and joyless, with a few unimagin-
    ative phrases, with a parrot's powers ofservation and a parrot's
    hard and poisonous bite. Edith Sitwell
    
    Working as a team, paired adjectives impress themselves
    upon the reader. And they often do more, reinforcing a point
    by restatement ("a brief and passing season") or suggesting
    subtle contrasts and efnplefnammnas Sitwell's
    sentence leads us to think about the distinction between
    "mirth" and "joy" and about how a laugh can be both "hard"
    and "piercing."
    
    Adjectives may also be accumulated in groups of three or
    more; as in this description of an famaHyAmerican
    
    ... awilful, clannish, hard-drinking, fornicating tribe.

    crash-megiggle insane ass.... is practicing howling below-stairs
    with a brute of a singing-master so horribly, that my head is nearly
    off. Edmund Lear
    
    Passages like these, especially the second, are virtuoso per-
    formances in which exaggeration becomes its own end. Of
    course, exposition cannot indulge itself like this very often.
    But sobriety needs relief, and verbal exuberance dazzles and
    delights. Whatever may be the objective truth of such fusil-
    lades of modifiers, they bring us into startling contact with
    the thoughts and feelings of the writer— the immediate of
    communication.
    
    Position
    
    Two positions in a clause or sentence are more emphatic than
    any other— and the closing. Elsewhere emphasis
    must depend on inversion, isolation, modification, restate-
    ment, and so forth. (Of course these techniques may work in
    harness with positioning to give even greater strength to
    opening and closing words.)
    
    Opening with key words has much to recommend it. Im-
    mediately, readers see what is important. E. M. Forster, for
    example, begins a paragraph on "curiosity" with the follow-
    ing sentence, identifying his topic at once:
    
    Curiosity is one of the lowest human faculties.
    
    Putting the essential idea first is natural, suited to a style aim-
    ing at the simplicity and directness of forceful speech:
    
    Great blobs of rain fall. Rumble of thunder. Lightning streaking blue
    on the building. P. Donleavy.
    
    Donleavy's sentences mirror the immediacy of the experience,
    going at once to what dominates his perception—the
    feel of rain, thunder, lightning. (The two fragments also en-
    hance the forcefulness of the passage.)
    
    Beginning (or ending) with the principal idea is advantageous in developing a contrast, which is strengthened if the
    following clause or sentence opens with the opposing term:
    
    Science was traditionally aristocratic, speculative, intellectual in intent; technology was lower-class, empirical, action-oriented.
    Lynn White, Jr.
  - |-
    Postponing a major point to the end of the sentence is more formal and literary. The writer must have the entire sentence in mind from the first word. On the other hand, the final position is more emphatic than the opening, perhaps because we remember best what we have read last:
    
    So the great gift of symbolism, which is the gift of reason, is at the same time the seat of man's peculiar darakeressi—the lunacy. Susanne Kanger
    
    (2) EMPHASIS 213
    
    Like the opening position, the closing is also useful for reinforcing contrasts and iterations:
    
    We can never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was "legal" and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did was "illegal." Martin Luther Sting,
    
    But Marx was not only a social scientist; he was a reformer. W. T. Jones
    
    Inexperienced writers often waste the final position. Consider, for instance, how much more effective is the revision of this statement:
    
    As the military power of Kafiristan increases, so too does the pride that Dravot has.
    
    REVISION: AS the military power of Kafiristan increases, so too does Dravot's pride.
    
    In topic sentences, finally, the closing position is often reserved for the idea the paragraph will develop (if it can be done without awkwardness). Here, for instance, is the opening sentence of a paragraph about Welsh Christianity:
    
    The third legacy of the Romans was Welsh Christianity. George Macaulay Trevelyan
    
    Isolation
    
    An isolated word or phrase is cut off by punctuation. It can occur anywhere in the sentence but is most common—and most éifebrigisniate or end, positions, as we have seen, emphatic in themselves:
    
    Leibnitz, it has sometimes been said, was the last man to know everything. Colin Cherry
    
    Children, curled in little balls, slept on straw scattered on wagon beds. Sherwood Anderson
    
    If the King notified his pleasure that a briefless lawyer should be made a judge or that a libertine baronet should be made a peer, the gravest counsellors, after a little murmuring, submitted.
    
    Thomas Babington Macaulay
  - |-
    And then, you will recall, he [Henry Thoreau] told of being present at the auction of a deacon's effects and of noticing, among the innumerable odds and ends representing the accumulation of a lifetime, a dried tapeworm. E. B. White
    
    It is also possible to use both ends of a sentence. See how neatly this sentence isolates and emphasizes the two key terms "position" and "difficult":
    
    The positionsstifave positions, other than upright—of the poet born in Wales or of Welsh parentage and writing his poems in English is today made by many people unnecessarily, and trivially, difficult. Dylan Thomas
    
    Isolating a word or phrase in the middle of the sentence is less common but by no means rare:
    
    1 was late for lédabstennexeusably so—and homework. Emily Brown
    
    Whether the isolated expression comes first, last, or in between, it must be set off by commas, dashes, or a colon. (As isolating marks, colons never go around words within a sentence; usually they precede something at the end, though they may also follow an initial word.) Generally, dashes mark a longer pause than commas and hence imply stronger stress: "thaaddetd yratit' emphasizes the adverb a little more than does "Suddenly, it began to rain." A colon before a closing term is stronger than a comma, but about the same as a dash.
    
    Isolation involves more, however, than just punctuating a word or phrase you wish to emphasize. The isolation must occur at a place allowed by the conventions of English grammar. In the following sentence "Harry" may properly be split from its verb and isolated by an intruding adverbial phrase:
    
    Harry, it was clear, was not the man for the job.
    
    But it would be un-English arbitrarily to place a comma between "Harry" and the verb:
    
    Harry, was not the man for the job.
  - |-
    The emphasis gained by ssobatasis—dhlgen-
    eralerelodsan merely add strength to particular
    words: it conveys nuances of meaning. Suppose, for instance,
    that the sentence by Macaulay quoted above were to end like
    this:
    
    ... the gravest counsellors submitted, after a little murmuring.
    
    The words are the same and the grammar and the logic, but
    not the implications. Macaulay, while admitting that the
    counsellors of Charles II occasionally protested, stresses their
    submissiveness; the revision, while acknowledging that they
    submitted, makes their protest more important. In short, the
    two sentences evaluate the king's ministers differently.
    
    As one example of how isolation can endow a word
    with special meaning, read this sentence by Lewis Thomas:
    
    There was a quarter-page advertisement in The London Observer
    for a computer service that will enmesh your name in an electronic
    network of fifty thousand other names, sort out your tastes, prefer-
    ences, habits, and deepest desires and match them up with opposite
    numbers, and retrieve for you, within a matter of seconds, friends.
    
    Balance
    
    A balanced sentence (see pages 128 ff.) divides into roughly
    equal parts on either side of a central pause. Usually the pause
    is marked by a comma or other stop, though now and then
    it may be unpunctuated. The halves of a balanced sentence
    are often independent clauses, but sometimes one will be a
    dependent clause or even a long phrase. In any case, the two
    parts must be roughly the same in length and of comparable
    significance, although they need not be of the same gram-
    matical order.
    
    In balanced construction words are stressed by being po-
    sitioned so that they are played against one another:
    
    It is a sort of cold extravagance; and it has made him all his
    enemies. C. Chesterton
    
    He had a wife he could do nothing; he had a wife
    he did whatever she chose. Thomas Babington Macaulay
    
    Chesterton draws our attention to the connection between a
    "cold extravagance" and making "enemies." Macaulay, play-
    ing "do nothing" against "did whatever she chose," com-
    ments wryly on the freedom of the married man.
  - |-
    Polysyndeton and Asyndeton
    
    Despite their formidable names, polysyndeton and asyndeton
    are nothing more than different ways of handling a list or
    series. Polysyndeton places a conjunction (and, or) after every
    term in the list (except, of course, the last). Asyndeton uses
    no conjunctions and separates the terms of the list with com-
    mas. Both differ from the conventional treatment of lists and
    series, which is to use only commas between all items except
    the last two, these being joined by a conjunction (with or
    
    without a cooptienald:
    
    CONVENTIONAL We stopped on the way to camp and bought
    supplies: bread, butter, cheese, hamburger, hot
    dogs, and beer.
    
    POLYSYNDETON We stopped on the way to camp and bought
    supplies: bread and butter and cheese and ham-
    burger and hot dogs and beer.
    
    ASYNDETON We stopped on the way to camp and bought
    supplies: bread, butter, cheese, hamburger, hot
    dogs, beer.
    
    The conventional treatment of a series emphasizes no par-
    ticular item, though the last may seem a little more important.
    In polysyndeton emphasis falls more evenly upon each mem-
    ber of the series, and also more heavily:
    
    I was bright and clean and polished. Alfred Kazin
    
    It is the season of suicide and divorce and prickly dread, whenever
    the ialmas. Joan Didion
    
    In asyndeton too the series takes on more significance as a
    whole than it does in the conventional pattern. But the stress
    on each individual item is lighter than in polysyndeton, and
    the passage moves more quickly:
    
    His care, his food, his shelter, his education—all by-
    products of his parents' position. Margaret Mead
    
    Polysyndeton and asyndeton do not necessarily improve a
    series. Most of the time the usual treatment is more appro-
    priate. However, when I wish a different emphasis re-
    member that polysyndeton and asyndeton exist.
    
    Repetition
    
    In a strict sense, repetition is a matter more of diction than of
    sentence structure. But since it is one of the most valued
    means of emphasis we shall include it here.
  - |-
    Repetition is sometimes a virtue and sometimes a fault.
    Drawing the line is not easy. It depends on what is being
    repeated. Important ideas can stand repetition; unimportant
    ones cannot. When you write the same word (or idea) twice,
    you draw the reader's attention to it. If it is a key idea, fine.
    But if not, then you have awkwardly implied importance to
    something that does not matter very much. In the following
    examples, of course, we are concerned with positive repeti-
    tion, involving major ideas.
    
    Repetition may take two basic forms: restating the same
    idea in different terms (called tautology by rhetori-
    cians) and repeating the same exact word (or a variant form
    of the same word).
    
    Tautologia
    In tautology the synonyms are frequently stronger than the
    original term:
    
    That's camouflage, that's trickery, that's treachery, window-
    dressing. Malcolm X
    
    A second term need not be strictly synonymous with the
    first, and often it is not. Rather than simply restating the idea,
    the new terms may add shades of meaning:
    
    October 7 began as a commonplace enough day, one of those days
    that sets the teeth on edge with its tedium, its small frustrations.
    Joan Didion
    
    One clings to chimeras, by which one can only be betrayed, and
    the entire Goye-+rtezlom dispppsiiisity —of
    
    James Baldwin
    
    In Ridsom's "frustrations" signifies a worse con-
    dition than "tedium," but the ideas relate to the extent that
    tedium may contribute to frustration. In Baldwin's, "possi-
    bility" implies a deeper despair.
    
    Now and then, a writer uses an expression just so he or she
    can replace it with another:
    (2) EMPHASIS 219
    
    That consistent stance, repeatedly adopted, must mean one of
    two—no, three—things. John Gardner
    
    Finally, repetition of an idea may involve simile or
    metaphor:
    
    It follows that any struggle against the abuse of language is a sen-
    timental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or hand
    som gakgpotenes. George Orwell
  - |-
    [ImHenry] James nothing is forestalled, nothing is obvious; one is
    forever turning the curve of the unexpected. James Huneker
    
    The image contained in a simile or metaphor often both
    clarifies and emphasizes an idea by translating it into more
    concrete or familiar terms. Consider Orwell's sentence. (In-
    cidentally, he is paraphrasing a view he does not agree with;
    he believes that abuses of language should be struggled
    against.) We cannot see a "sentimental archaism" (we may
    not even know what one is). But, familiar with candles and
    electric light, we can understand that a preference for candles
    is somehow perverse. And Huneker, practicing the very qual-
    ity he praises in the novelist Henry James, startles us by the
    unexpectedness of his metaphor.
    
    Repeating the Same Word
    
    This is a very effective means of emphasis and susceptible to
    considerable variation. Greek and Roman rhetoricians distin-
    guished about two dozen varieties of verbal repetition, de-
    pending on the positions and forms of the repeated terms.
    For example, the words may begin successive clauses, or end
    them, or even end one and begin the next; the words may be
    repeated side by side, or three or four times, or in variant
    
    2. A simile is a literal comparison commonly introduced by like or as: Robert
    Burns's line "my love is like a red rose" contains a simile. A meta-
    
    phor is a literal identification, as if Burns had written "my luv is a red, red
    rose." Sometimes metaphors simply use the second term to mean the first:
    "my red, red rose"="my luv."
    220 THE SENTENCE
    
    forms. In ancient rhetoric each pattern had its own learned
    name. We needn't bother with those here. But you should
    realize that the patterns themselves are still very much in use.
    Nor are they used only by writers consciously imitating the
    classics. They are at home in the prose of men and women
    who belong to our world and have something to say about
    it. The patterns of repetition remain vital because we enjoy
    unusual and clever combinations. Here, then, are some ex-
    amples of skillful verbal repetition, which not only emphasize
    important words but also are interesting and entertaining in
    
    themselves:

    Mechanical Emphasis
    
    Mechanical emphasis consists of exclamation points and of printing or writing words in an unusual way. Italic type is probably the most common method of calling attention to a word or phrase. (In handwriting or typing, the equivalent to italics is a single underline.)

    222 THE SENTENCE
    
    Other devices of mechanical emphasis include quotation marks, capital letters, boldface and other changes in the style or size of type, different colored links, wider spacing of words or letters, and Kegatronds-plaqphgases on separate lines. Advertisements reveal how well all these techniques work.
    
    In composition, however, they work less effectively. An experienced writer does not call upon exclamation points or underlining very often. They quickly lose their value, revealing that one does not know how to create emphasis and so has shouted.
    
    Certainly in the examples above the italics and the exclamation point are effective. But in each case the mechanical device merely strengthens an emphasis already attained by more compositional means. Baldwin's sentence puts the key idea last and carefully prepares its way with a colon. Thoreau draws our attention to "it" not only by using italics but by repeating the word at the beginning of three brief, emphatic sentences. And Emerson stresses "how often" more by isolating it than by the exclamation point.
    
    CHAPTER ,
    
    The Well-Written Sentence:
    (3) Rhythm
  - |-
    When things that we see or hear are repeated in identical or similar patterns the result is rhythm. In prose there are two patterns, both involving words, or more exactly the sounds of words. The most obvious is syllabic stress. Loud and soft syllables. Loud syllables are said to be stressed and for purposes of analysis are marked by /; soft syllables are unstressed and marked. Writers create syllabic rhythm by arranging stresses and nonstresses in more or less regular patterns, as in:
    
    x / x / x / x /
    
    A lucky few escaped the fire.
    
    The second pattern is rhythmic intonation. Intonation is a change in the pitch of the voice, a kind of melody important in speaking. Think, for example, of how many shades of meaning you can give to the words yes and no, not only by loudness and softness but by altering the rise and fall of your
    
    1. Distinguishing only two degrees of loudness and softness is arbitrary. In actual speech innumerable gradations exist. However, limiting the number to two is convenient. Sometimes an intermediate stage, called secondary stress, is distinguished and marked. The process of analyzing syllabic rhythm is called
    
    291§NTENCE THE
    
    rhythm based on intonation is created by repeating phrases or clauses of similar construction so that the same "melody" plays several times. Here is an instance from a poem by Alfred Tennyson:
    
    The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep
    moans round with many voices.
    
    We hear this sentence as a three-part construction with an identical pattern of intonation in the first two clauses. The third repeats the melody in the fost words but varies it
    
    in the concluding phrase. Intonational rhythm coexists with syllabic. Thus Tennyson's lines also show an almost perfect alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables:
    
    xX / \ / xX / \ / xX /
    
    The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep
    \ / x / xX xX
    
    Moans round with many voices.
  - |-
    Finally a word of caution: there is an inevitable subjective element in rhythm, which is, after all, something we hear. Even sensitive, experienced readers do not all "hear" the same sentence in exactly the same way. We cannot say, however, that rhythm is purely a matter of perception, different for each one of us. Writers and unders do—regulate what their readers hear, not completely, but within fezky limits.
    
    Effective Rhythm
    
    Rhythm is effective when it pleases the ear. Even more important, good rhythm enters into what a sentence says, enhancing and reinforcing its meaning. A necessary condition of effective rhythm is that a passage be laid out in clear syntactic units (phrases, clauses, whole sentences); that these have something in common (length, intonation, grammatical structure); and that there be a loose but discernible pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables. Generally the syntactic units, while showing some similarities, are very far from exactly the same. Nor are the syllables laid out in precisely repeated patterns. In this respect prose rhythm is much looser than that of traditional accented poetry, which has a much more predictable arrangement of stressed and unstressed syllables.
    Here are two examples of rhythm in prose:
    
    x x x i X x i i XX i XX x/ x x x i
    There was a magic, and a spell and a curse; but the magic has been
    xx k

    railway ahead of us us. Emest Hemingway
  - |-
    Dettfasis moves in carefully articulated parts: two
    primary clauses separated by the semicolon, and, within each
    of these, three secondary units marked by commas. Each of
    the six units has a similar pattern of stressed and unstressed
    syllables, a pattern regular enough to be sensed, yet not so
    relentless that it dominates the sentence, turning it into sing-
    song. In the passage by Hemingway the basic units are simple
    sentences. The syllabic rhythm is less obvious than in Duf-
    fus's case, partly because Hemingway's sentences are not fur-
    ther broken up and partly because the pattern of stresses and
    nonstresses is a bit more irregular.
    
    Awkward Rhythm
    
    Poor rhythm usually results from either or both of two
    causes: (1) the sentence is not organized so that phrases and
    clauses create a pattern out of which rhythm can evolve; (2)
    syllables are poorly grouped, being either so irregular that no
    pattern at all can be grasped, or so rapnelaevidly
    a steady, obtrusive beat overrides everything else.
    
    Consider this example of poor rhythm:
    
    Each party promises before the election to make the city bigger and
    better, but what happens after the election?
    
    There are two problems: first, the initial clause does not break
    into well-defined groups. This fault can be corrected by
    changing the position of the adverbial phrase, using it as a
    sentence opener or as an interrupter, and in either case punc-
    tuating it:
    
    Before the election, each party promises to make the city bigger
    and better... .
    
    Each party, before the election, promises to make the city bigger
    and better... .
    
    Now the clause is organized into potential rhythmic units.
    
    The second fault is that the writer has mixed a statement
    and a question in the same sentence. The different intonations
    clash, leaving the ear dissatisfied. It would be wiser to place
    the ideas in separate sentences:
    
    Before the election, each party promises to make the city bigger
    and better. But what happens after the election?
  - |-
    Other improvements might be made. For instance, shortening the question to "But what happens afterwards?" would make it less repetitious and more emphatic. But just as it stands, adding no words and taking none away, our revision shows that poor rhythm can often be improved simply by rearranging the words.
    
    Sometimes, however, mere rearrangement is not enough. Consider this case:
    
    (3) RHYTHM "7
    
    / x / x / /
    
    The man was standing on the sas and ‘tar ‘below we saw the boy, who
    xX /X x
    
    wore an old, unpressed, "and ragged suit.
    
    The sentence has one of the same difficulties as the first ex-
    ample: it needs to be divided more clearly (or at least its first
    two clauses do). But it also has a different problem: its syllabic
    rhythm is too regular. With one exception the sentence scans
    as a series of unvaried iambs." The regularity dominates the
    sentence, obscuring shadings of emphasis.
    
    If the iambic pattern is made less relentless the sentence
    sounds much better:
    
    xX / / X X X/ xf Xf X XT /
    
    The man stood on the stairs; far below we saw the boy, dressed in an
    / x / / x /
    
    old, unpressed, ragged suit.
    
    The changes—focusing on "standing" and
    "dressed" for "who wore," and replacing two "ands" with a
    semicolon and a uprttmaxebseake sameness of
    the syllabic beat. Yet they leave pattern enough to please the
    ear. Furthermore, the clustered stresses now focus the reader's
    attention upon key points:
    
    / xf x sw / / /
    man stood ... boy dressed . . old, unpressed, ragged suit
    
    Meaningful Rhythm
    
    Good rhythm enters into the meaning of the sentence, not
    only reinforcing the words but often giving them nuances
    they might not otherwise have.
    
    2. An iamb is a unit of two syllables, a nonstress and a stress, as in the word
    xX f x
    
    above. The one exception in the example is the four syllables "-ing
    x x /
    
    on the stairs."
  - |-
    Mimetic means "imitative." Mimetic rhythm imitates the perception a sentence describes or the feeling or ideas it conveys:
    
    x / / x / / ix {x x x x / x f
    The tide reaches flood stage, slackens, hesitates, and begins to ebb.
    Rachel Carson
    
    The flowing tide is suggested by the very movement of this
    sentence, which runs smoothly and uninterruptedly to a mid-
    point, slows down, pauses (the commas), and then picks up
    and runs to its end. Here is a similar, somewhat longer, sen-
    tence about Niagara Falls:
    
    / x / x x f x f / x xf x x f x
    On the edge of disaster the river seems to gather herself, to pause, to
    x / xX xX x x
    i a head nobie in ruin, and then, with a slow grandeur, to ‘plunge into
    x x /
    the sternal thunder and white chaos below. Rupert Brooke
    
    Mimetic rhythm may also imply ideas more abstract than
    physical movement, as in this passage describing the life of
    peasants:
    
    x f x x f / x ¢ x f xX
    
    Black bread, rude root, dark night, laborious day, weary arm at sunset;
    / /
    and life ebbs away. John Ruskin
    
    The six unrelieved stresses at the beginning mirror the dreary
    monotony of the peasant's existence. Then nonstressed syl-
    lables become more numerous and the sentence picks up
    speed and runs to a close, just as life slips away (in Ruskin's
    view) from the peasant before he has held and savored it. ¢
    
    Metrical Runs
    
    A metrical run is a relatively regular pattern of stresses and
    nonstresses. This is, of course, a feature of traditional poetry,
    (3) RHYTHM 229
    
    but not common in prose. It is, as we have seen, a fault when
    it is not controlled. But used with restraint and skill, metrical
    runs are effective. Though not speanficafiy, like
    
    mimetic rhythms, they make a sentence memorable and in-
    tensify its mood and meaning:

    I love to lie in bed and read the lives of the Popes of Rome.

    /xx/fx x
    This is a story about love and death in the golden land, and begins with
    x / x
    the country. Joan Didion
    
    Smith and Didion achieve their metrical runs in part by using
    prepositional phrases. A typical prepositional phrase consists
    of a one- or two-syllable preposition, a noun marker /a, an,
    the, this, that, and so on), and an object of (usually) one or
    two syllables. Neither the preposition nor the marker is
    stressed, while the object (or one of its syllables) is, so that
    one of these metrical patterns is likely:
    
    xX /
    
    at home
    
    xX xX /
    
    in the house
    
    x x / X
    
    in the morning
    x x x f
    
    in the event
    
    Such metrical patterns (or "meters") are said to be rising
    since the stress comes at or near the end. By adding modifiers
    or doubling the objects of a preposition or stringing together
    several phrases, it is possible to sustain a rising pattern over
    the whole or a portion of a sentence:
    
    x xi X % / x x / /
    about love and death in the golden land
    
    Sometimes a metrical run occurs at the end of a sentence,
    bringing it neatly to a close:

    effect is subtly to draw our attention. Responding uncon-
    sciously to the rhythm, we feel that a sentence is important
    and we are more likely to remember it. Certainly a metrical
    run will not dogmefking silly, but it will help us to
    think about something important.
    
    Rhythmic Breaks
    
    One advantage of maintaining a fairly regular rhythm is that
    you can alter it for special effect:
    
    x ff x x Ff x x ¢ x ff x x /
    
    The roses have faded at Mabreditynthe frost.
    
    Amy Lowell
    
    There are four rising meters up to the comma, then an un-
    expected stress upon "nipped," which throws great weight
    upon that word, making it the center of the sentence. And it
    is a key word, for the sentence alludes to the sad story of
    Josephine, Napoleon's first wife, who was divorced by him
    for political reasons and who retired to her palatial home of
    Malmaison, famous for its roses.
    
    And look, finally, once again at the sentence by Logan
    Pearsall Smith, quoted above:
    
    (3) RHYTHM 231
    
    x / x! | | Ix x Axi / x x xX
    Beyond the blue hills, within riding distance, there is a country of parks
    x x / of
    
    x i xX X i
    and beeches with views of the far-off sea.
    
    The rising meters which run throughout most of the sentence
    abruptly change at the end to three clustered stresses, making
    the "far-off sea" the climax of the vision.
    
    Rhyme
    
    Rhyme is the repetition of sounds in positions close enough
    to be noticed. It is not an aspect of rhythm; even so we shall
    glance at it. We associate rhyme chiefly with poetry, espe-
    cially in the form of end chysimg-efhseiccessive or
    
    alternate lines with the same sound:
    
    The grave's a fine and private place,
    But none, think, do there embrace. Andrews Marvell
    
    Poetry also often uses inner shynts-wiepaating
    a line, as with the and i vowels and the p's of fitMarvell's
    line.
  - |-
    Despite its association with poetry, rhyme occurs in prose,
    usually as inner rhyme (prose writers rarely end sentences or
    clauses with the same sound). Like rhythm, rhyme can affect
    the ear both pleasantly and unpleasantly, and it can enhance
    meaning.
    
    It seems unlikely that sounds have inherent, culture-free
    significance in themselves. Particular sounds may acquire
    loose meanings; for example, we seem to associate the ee
    sound with smallness (teeny, weeny). But psychologists who
    have studied this phenomenon think that such "meanings"
    are culturally conditioned and will vary from one group to
    another.
    
    Even if language sounds do not possess inherent universal
    meanings, the fact that within a particular culture
    certain sounds can evoke particular attitudes. Even here,
    
    232 THE SENTENCE
    
    however, one must be careful in talking about "meaning."
    Such meaning is broad and resists precise interpretation. In
    the following description by Mark Twain of a town on the
    Mississippi, the frequent / sounds, the sfs3 andtis,n's
    probably contribute to the sense of peace and quiet. Words like
    lull, lullaby, loll, slow, silent, ssh, shush, and hush have con-
    ditioned us to associate those sounds with quietness. But that
    is about all we can say.
    
    After all these years tan picture that old time to myself now, just
    as it was then: the white town drowsing in the sunshine of a sum-
    mers morning; the streets empty or pretty nearly so; one or two
    clerks sitting in front of the Water Street stores, with their splint-
    bottomed chairs tilted back against the walls, chins on breasts, hats
    slouched over their faces, sblagte—-shathngs enough
    
    around to show what broke them down; a sow and a litter of pigs
    loafing along the sidewalk, doing a good business in watermelon
    rinds and seeds; two or three lonely little freight piles scattered
    about the "levee"; a pile of "skids" on the slope of the stone-paved
    wharf, and the fragrant town drunkard asidep shadow of

    them; two or three wood flats at the head of the wharf, but nobody
    to listen to the peaceful lapping of the wavelets against them; the
    great Mississippi, the majestic, the magnificent Mississippi, rolling
    its mile-wide tide along, shining in the sun; the "point" above the
    town, and the "point" below, bounding the river-glimpse and turn-
    ing it into a sort of sea, and withal a very still and brilliant and
    lonely one.
    
    If we do not insist upon interpreting their "meaning" too
    exactly, then, it is fair to say that sounds can convey or re-
    inforce certain moods.
    
    They may also contribute to meaning in another, less direct
    way. By rhyming key words, writers draw attention to them.
    Here, for instance, Virginia Woolf uses an image by re-
    peating s sounds and by the alliteration of the /'s and the c's:
    
    Dust swirls down the avenue, hisses and hurries like erected cobras
    round the corners.
    (3) RHYTHM 233
    
    And in the following case the writer emphasizes "wilderness" by repeating s and "decay" by repeating d:
    
    Otherwise the place is bleakly uninteresting; a wilderness of wind-
    swept grasses and sinewy weeds waving away from a thin beach
    ever speckled with drift and decaying things—worm-ridden
    bers, dead porpoises. Lafcadio Hearn
    
    Yet prose rhyme is risky. Hearn succeeds, but the alliter-
    ation (and other rhyme) in these passages seems a bit much:
    
    Her eyes were full of proud and passionless lust after gold and
    blood; her hair, close and curled, seems ready to shudder in sunder
    and divide into snakes. Algernon Charles Swinburne
    
    His boots are tight, the sun is hot, and he may be shot.
    Amy Lowell
  - |-
    Excesses like this have led some people to damn and blast all
    rhyme in prose. Undoubtedly a little goes a long way. But it
    does have a place. The trick is to keep the rhyme unobtrusive,
    so that it directs our responses without our being aware of its
    influence. Certain things should be avoided: obvious and jingling rhyme or inadvertent repetitions of sound that draw
    attention to unimportant words. More positively, rhyme
    pleases the ear and makes us more receptive to what the sentence says, as in this passage by John Donne (a seventeenth-century poet who also wrote great prose):
    
    One dieth at his filongth, being wholly at ease, and in quiet,
    and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eats with
    pleasure; but they lie down alike in the dust and the worm covers
    them.
    
    Thus rhyme's positive contribution in prose. It
    is less important, and less common, than rhythm, but it is far
    from negligible. Too great a concern with sound, too much
    "tone painting," is a fault in prose (in poetry too, for that
    matter). Controlled by a sensitive ear, however, the sounds
    of a sentence can enrich its meaning.

    The Well-Written Sentence:

    The Smith disclosures shocked [President] Harding not into political

    to Europe. His nerve was shaken. He lost his taste for revelry. The
    plans for the Alaska trip were radically revised. Instead of an itinerant whoopee, it was now to be a serious political mission.
    Samuel Hopkins Adams
  - |-
    Both of those passages consist chiefly of short, simple sentences. The first them poorly, the second effectively.
    
    Where does the difference lie? The first writer has not grasped the twin principles of recurrence and variety which govern sentence style. A professional author, understands them very well.
    
    Recurrence means repeating a basic sentence pattern. Variety means changing the pattern. Paradoxical as it sounds, good sentence style must do both. Enough sameness must appear in the sentences to make the writing seem all of a piece; enough difference to create interest.
    
    (4) VARIETY 235
    
    How much recurrence, how much variety depend on subject and purpose. For instance, when you repeat the same point or develop a series of parallel ideas, the similarity of subject justifies the similarity in structure. Thus Adams repeats the same pattern in his second through seventh sentences because they have much the same content, detailing the steps President Harding took to divert the scandal threatening his administration. Here the recurrent style evolves from the subject.
    
    In the other passage, however, the writer makes no such connection between style and subject, and so the recurrence seems awkward and monotonous. The ideas expressed in the separate sentences are not of the same order of value. For example, the fact that the theater is in Hartford is less important than that it shows foreign films. The sentence style, in other words, does not reinforce the writer's ideas; it obscures them.
    
    Nor has the writer offered any relief from his short, straightforward statements. Adams has. Moreover, Adams uses variety effectively to structure his paragraph, opening with a relatively long sentence, which, though grammatically simple, is complicated by the correlative But construction. And he closes the paragraph by beginning a sentence, for the first time, with something other than the subject.
    
    Adams's brief sentences work because the subject justifies them and because they are sufficiently varied. Lacking similar justification or relief, the four sentences of the first passage are ineffective. They could be improved easily:
    
    The Art Cinema, a movie theater in Hartford, specializes in foreign films. It is noted for the high quality of its films; in fact, many people consider them good art.
  - |-
    There is still recurrence: in effect the passage consists of three
    similar short clauses plus an appositive. But now there is more
    variety. In the first sentence an appositive interrupts subject
    236 THE SENTENCE
    
    and verb; in the second there are two clauses instead of one,
    the latter opening with the phrase "in fact." Subordinating
    the information about Hartford also keeps the focus where it
    belongs, on the films.
    Of course, in composing a sentence that differs &thars,
    
    a writer is more concerned with emphasis than with variety.
    But if it is usually a by-product, variety is nonetheless im-
    portant, an essential condition of interesting, readable prose.
    Let us consider, then, a few ways in which variety may be
    attained.
    
    Changing Sentence Length and Pattern
    
    From the beginning she had known what she wanted, and pro-
    ceeded single-minded, with the force of a steam engine towards
    her goal. There was never a moment's doubt or regret. She wanted

    his dark Arabic face, his "questing panther eyes," he was, for her,
    that lodestar East, the embodiment of all her thoughts. Man and
    land were identified. Lesley Blanch
    
    It is not necessary, or even desirable, to maintain a strict
    alternation of long and short statements. You need only an
    occasional brief sentence to change the pace of predominately
    long ones, or a long sentence now and then in a passage com-
    posed chiefly of short ones:
    
    We took a hair-raising taxi ride into the city. The rush-hour traffic
    of Bombay is a iightmarertiotas in Tokyo; nor
    
    from exuberance, as in Rome; not from malice, as in Paris; it is a

    his own union treasury to hire a stockade of lawyers to protect him.

    Prosecution dragged in the courts. Convictions were appealed.
    Delay. John Dos Passos
    
    Sometimes variation in length can be used to emphasize a
    key idea. In the following passage the historian Herbert Buttenfrebd through two long sentences (the second a bit
    shorter than the first) strong short statement:
    
    The Whig historian is interested in discovering agency in history,
    even where in this way he must avow it only implicit. It is characteristic of his method that he should be interested in the agency
    rather than in the process. And this is how he achieves his
    simplification.
    
    Fragments
    
    Fragments, usually a special kind of short sentence, make for
    effective tarsatiand-easy to use (italics highlight the fragments in the next examples):
    
    Sam steals like this because he is a thief. Not a big thief. He tried
    to be a big thief once and everybody got mad at him and made
    him go away to jail. He is strictly a small thief, and he only steals
    for his restaurant. Jimmy Breslin

    all the critical hours. All that solemnity for a few facts! touldn't
    believe they were serious. hever quite understood it.
    
    Mary Caroline Richards
    
    Used with restraint, fragments like these are a simple way to
    vary your sentences. They are, however, more at home in a
    colloquial style than in a formal one.
    
    Rhetorical Questions
    
    Like fragments or any other kind of unusual sentence, rhetorical questions are rarely used for variety alone. Their
    primary purpose is to emphasize a point or to set up a topic
    for discussion. Still, whenever they are employed for such
    ends, they are also a source of variety:
    
    But Tonbeteubjerantone must say something—
    what must one say about Toronto? What can one? What has any-
    body ever said? It is impossible to give it anything but commendation. if not squalid like Birmingham, or cramped Caltken,

    or scattered like Edmonton, or sham like Berlin, or hellish like New
    York, or tiresome like Nice. It is all right. The only depressing thing
    is that it will always be what it is, only larger, and that no Canadian
    city can ever be anything better or different. If they are good they
    may become Toronto. Rupert Brooke
    
    Varied Openings
    
    Monotony especially threatens when sentence after sentence
    begins the same way. It is easy to open with something other
    than the usual subject and verb: a prepositional phrase; an
    adverbial clause; a connective like therefore or an adverb like
    naturally, or, immediately following the subject and splitting
    it from the verb, a nonrestrictive adjectival construction. Take
    a look at this passage:
    
    In the first decade of the new century, the South remained primarily
    rural; the beginnings of change, in those years, hardly affected the
    lot of the Negro. The agricultural system had never recovered fully
    from the destruction of the old plantation economy. Bound to the
    production of stafites+tobacod, suf- sugar—the
    
    fered from erosion and neglect. Those who cultivated it depended
    at best upon the uncertain returns of fluctuating world markets. But
    the circumstances under which labor was organized, particularly
    Negro labor, added to those difficulties further hardships of human
    Creation. Oscar Handlin
    
    Handlin's five sentences show considerable variety in their
    openings: a prepositional phrase, a subject, a participial
    phrase, a subject, and a connective word.

    Meaning
  - |-
    To say that a word has meaning is to say that it has purpose.
    The purpose may be to signify something—that is, to an object or person other than the writer, to an abstract conception such as "democracy," or to a thought or feeling in the writer's mind. On the other hand, the purpose may be to induce a particular response in the readers' minds or to establish an appropriate relationship between the writer and those readers. We shall consider each of these three uses of words; we shall call them.
    
    Before we do that, however, we need to glance at several misconceptions about words and also at two aspects of meaning fundamental to all the purposes for which words may be used. These aspects concern denotative and connotative meaning and the various levels of usage.
    
    First the misconceptions.
    
    Words Are Not Endowed with Fixed and "Proper" Meanings
    
    When people object to how someone else uses a word, they often say, "That isn't its proper meaning." The word disinterested, for example, is frequently employed in the sense of "uninterested." If someone dislikes this usage, they argue that the proper meaning of disinterested is "objective, unbiased."
    
    In such arguments, "proper meaning" generally signifies meaning sanctioned by past usage or even by the original, etymological sense of the word. But the dogma that words come to us out of the past with proper meanings—fixed, immutable, and only meanings a word has are those that the speakers of the language choose to give it. If enough speakers of English use disinterested to mean "uninterested," then by definition, that is the meaning given to the word.
    
    Those who take a conservative attitude toward language have the right, even the duty, to resist changes which they feel lessen the efficiency of English. They should, however, base their resistance upon demonstrating why the change does make for inefficiency, not upon an authoritarian claim that it violates proper meaning.
  - |-
    As a user of words you should be guided by consensus,
    that is, the meanings agreed upon by your fellow speakers of
    English, the meanings recorded in dictionaries. We shall look
    at what dictionaries do in Chapter 29. For now, simply un-
    derstand that dictionary definitions are not "proper mean-
    ings" but succinct statements of consensual meanings.
    
    In most cases the consensus emerges from an activity in
    which individual language users participate without knowing
    that they are, in effect, defining words. The person who says
    "I was disinterested in the lecture" does not intend to alter
    the meaning of disinterested. He or she has simply heard the
    word used this way before. In a few cases people do act de-
    liberately to establish a consensual meaning, as when mathe-
    maticians agree that the word googol will mean "10 raised to
    the 100th power." In any case, meaning is what the group
    consents to. This is the only "proper meaning" words have,
    and any subsequent generation may consent to alter a
    consensus.
    
    But while the unconscious agreement which establishes the
    meaning of a word is a group activity, it originates with in-
    dividuals. Particular speakers began using disinterested in the
    sense of "uninterested" or square in the sense of "extremely
    conventional and unsophisticated." From the usage of indi-
    vidual people the change spreads through the group—for
    ter or worse.
    
    By such a process word meanings change, sometimes rap-
    idly, sometimes glacially. Often the change occurs as a re-
    sponse to historical events. When the eighteenth-century
    historian Edward Gibbon writes of "the constitution of a Ro-
    man legion" he means how it was organized, not, as a modern
    reader might suppose, a written document defining that or-
    ganization. The latter sense became common only after the
    late eighteenth century, with the spread of democratic revo-
    lutions and the formal writing down of a new government's
    principles.

    Because words must constantly be adapted to a changing
    world, no neat one-to-one correspondence exists between
    words and meanings. On the contrary, the relationship is
    messy: a single word may have half a dozen meanings or
    more, while several words may designate the same concept or
    entity. Thus depression means one thing to a psychologist,
    another to an economist, and another still to a geologist. But
    psychological "depression" may also be conveyed by mel-
    ancholia, the blues, or the dismals, in the dumps, low, and so
    on.
    
    One-to-one correspondences do in fact exist in the highly
    specialized languages of science and technology and mathe-
    matics. To a chemist sodium chloride means only the com-
    pound that compound is always designated in
    words by sodium chloride. The common term salt, in contrast,
    has a number of meanings, and we must depend on the con-
    text (that is, the words around it) to clarify which sense the
    writer intends:
    
    Pass the salt.
    She's the salt of the earth.
    They're not worth their salt.
    He's a typical old salt.
    Her wit has considerable salt.
    The crooks intended to sa/t the mine.
    They are going to sa/t away all the cash they can.
    
    But while one-to-one correspondences might seem desirable,
    having a distinct word for every conceivable object and idea
    and feeling would not be practical. The vocabulary would
    swell to unmanageable proportions. And probably we would
    like it less than we suppose. The inexact correspondence of
    words and meanings opens up possibilities of conveying sub-
    tleties of thought and feeling which an exactly defined vocab-
    ulary would exclude. The fact that sodium chloride means one
    thing and only one thing is both a virtue and a limitation. The
    fact that salt means many things is both a problem and an
    opportunity.
    
    Words, then, are far from being tokens of fixed and per-
    manent value. They are like living things, complex, many-
    sided, and responsive to pressures from their environment.
    They must be handled with care.
    
    Denotation and Connotation
  - |-
    Denotation and connotation are aspects of a word's meaning, related but distinct. Denotation is a word's primary, specific sense, as the denotation of red is the color (or, from the viewpoint of physics, light of a certain wavelength). Connotation is the secondary meaning (or meanings), associated with but different from the denotation. Red, for instance, has several connotations: "socialist," "anger," and "danger," among others.
    
    Using a circle to represent a word, we may show the denotation as the core meaning and the connotation as
    fringe meanings gathered about that core. The line enclosing the denotation (D in the diagram) is solid to signify that this meaning is relatively fixed. The line around the connotation (C) is broken to suggest that the connotative meanings of a word are less firm, more open to change and addition.
    
    Connotations may evolve naturally from the denotation of a word, or they may develop by chance associations. Rose connotes "fragrant," "beautiful," "short-lived" because the qualities natural to the flower have been incorporated into the word. On the other hand, that red connotes "socialist" is accidental, the chance result of early European socialists' using a red flag as their banner.
    
    Red
    
    C: anger
    
    Sometimes a connotative meaning splits off and becomes a second denotation, the nucleus, in effect, of another word configuration. Thus "socialist" has become a new primary meaning of red when used as a political term. Around this second nucleus other connotations have gathered, such as (for most Americans) "subversive," "un-American," "traitorous," and so on:

    ea  
    
    Often, though not inevitably, connotative meanings imply  
    degrees of approval or disapproval and may arouse emotions  
    such as affection, admiration, pity, disgust, hatred. Like posi-  
    tive and negative electrical charges, emotive connotations at-  
    tract or repel readers with regard to the thing or concept the  
    wWihnoldbsipnateact degree of attraction or re-  
    pulsion depends on how particular readers are themselves  
    charged concerning the thing or concept). These positive and  
    negative charges are extremely important to a word's connota-  
    tion, anthter diagrams we indicate by +theda— signs.  
    
    Individual words vary considerably in the relative weight  
    of their denotative and connotative meanings. Most technical  
    terms, for example, have very little connotation. That is their  
    virtue: they denote an entity or concept precisely and un-  
    ambiguously without the possible confusion engendered by  
    fringe meanings: diode, spisinaktWe may think of  
    such words as small and nonkpast-seatb speak.  
    
    They have no circle of connotations around them.  
    
    Connotation looms larger than denotation in other cases.  
    Some words have large and diffuse meanings. What matters  
    is their secondary or suggestive meanings, not their relatively  
    unimportant denotations. The expression old-fashioned, for  
    instance, hauls a heavy load of connotations. It denotes "be-  
    longing to, or characteristic of, the past." But far more im-  
    portant than that central meaning is the connotation, or rather

    two quite different connotations, that have gathered about the
    nucleus: (1) "valuable, worthy of honor and emulation" and
    (2) "foolish, ridiculous, out-of-date; to be avoided." With
    such words the large outer, or connotative, circle is signifi-
    cant; the nucleus small and insignificant.
    
    For many words denotation and connotation are both im-
    portant aspects of meaning. Rose (in the sense of the flower)
    has a precise botanical denotation: "any of a genus (Rosa of
    the family Rosaceae, the rose family) of usu[ally] prickly
    shrubs with pinnate leaves and showy flowers having five pet-
    als in the wild state but being often double or semidouble un-
    der cultivation." At the same time rose also has strong conno-
    tations: "beautiful," "fragrant," "short-lived," and so on.
    
    Context
    
    The denotation of any word is easy to learn: you need only
    look in a suitable dictionary. Understanding connotations,
    however, is more difficult. Dictionaries cannot afford the
    space to treat them, except in a very few cases. You can gain
    practical knowledge of a word's range of connotation only
    by becoming familiar with the contexts in which the word is
    used.
    
    Context means the surroundings of a word. In a narrow
    sense, context is the other terms in the phrase, clause, sen-
    tence and an immediate linguistic environment. More
    broadly, context comprises all the other words in the passage,
    even the entire essay or book. It widens further to include a
    composition's relation to other works, why it was written,
    and so on. In speech, context in this inclusive sense involves
    the occasion of a conversation, the relationship between the
    talkers, even others who may be listening.
    
    But one does not have to explore all the ramifications of
    context to get at a word's connotation. Usually the terms im-
    mediately around it supply the vital clue. Real old-fashioned

     flavor printed on an ice cream carton tells us that here old-
    fashioned connotes "valuable, rich in taste, worthy of admi-
    ration (and of purchase)." Don't he ald-fashioned—dare
    new experience in an ad for men's cologne evokes the opposite
    connotation: "foolish, ridiculous, out-of-date."
    
    Linguistic context acts as a selective screen lying over a
    word, revealing certain of its connotations, concealing others.
    Thus {fdal'flavor" mask the unfavorable connotation
    of old-fashioned, leaving us aware only of the positive one.
    Here is a diagram of old-fashioned in the "real/flavor"
    context:
    
    f Ce
    "valuable,
    worthy of
    honor and
    admiration;

    ~,
    
    In the context of "don't/dare a new experience," the
    screening effect is just the opposite:

    ridiculous, |
    out-of-date; |
    to be i
    avoided" /
    
    MEANING 251
    
    Not only does the linguistic context serve both to reveal
    and to hide certain of a word's connotations. It may also ac-
    tivate latent implications that ordinarily are not associated
    with a word. The meaning "rich in taste," for instance, is not
    one we customarily associate with old-fashioned. Yet in real
    olidafashioeedes to the surface.
    
    Context also helps you determine whether a word is func-
    tioning primarily in its denotative or connotative sense. With
    words like rose that carry both kinds of meaning, only con-
    text reveals which is operating, or if both are in varying de-
    grees. Clearly this sentence calls upon only the denotation of
    rose.
    
    Our wakiveoses have, in spite of their great variety, contrib-
    uted little to the development of our garden roses.
    
    But when the poet Robert Burns tells of his feelings for a
    young lady, while still denoting the flower, he uses the word
    primarily for its connotations:
    
    Qny is like a red, red rose
    That's newly sprung in June.
  - |-
    In choosing words, then, you must pay attention both to denotative and to connotative meaning. With a purely denotative word like szasv@je problem is simple. If you make a mistake with such a word, it is simply because you do not know what it means and had better consult a dictionary (or textbook). But when words must be chosen with an eye to their connotations, the problem is more difficult. Connotative meaning is more diffuse, less readily looked up in a reference book, more subtly dependent on context. Here mistakes are easier to make. For instance, if you want readers to like a character you are describing, it would be unwise to write "a fat man with a red face," even though the words are literally accurate. Fat and red are negatively charged in such a context. More positive would be "a stout [or plump] man with rosy cheeks."
    
    Levels of Usage
    
    Levels of usage refers to the kind of situation in which a word is normally used. Most words suit all occasions. Some, however, are restricted to formal, literary contexts, and others to informal, colloquial ones. Consider three verbs which roughly mean the same thing: exacerbate, annoy, bug. Talking among your friends, you would not be likely to say, "That person really exacerbated me." On the other hand, describing a historical episode you wouldn't (or shouldn't) write, "The Spartan demands bugged the Athenians." But you could use annoy on both occasions, without arousing derision in either friends or readers of your work.
    
    The three words differ considerably in their levels of usage. Exacerbate is a literary word, appropriate to formal occasions. Bug (in this sense) is a colloquial, even slang, term appropriate to speech and very informal writing. Annoy is an all-purpose word, suitable for any occasion. When in the next chapter we discuss the practical problem of appropriateness, we shall use the labels formal, amfbryeudyal to distinguish these broad levels of usage.
  - |-
    From the more theoretical viewpoint we are taking here,
    we may think of level of usage as a peripheral part of a word's
    connotation. As with connotation in general, it is not easy to
    look up the level of usage of any particular word. Dictionaries
    label an occasional term "colloquial" or "slang," but not in
    every case; and they do not label formal words like exacerbate
    at all. You have to depend on your own knowledge as a guide.
    
    In recent years the line between formal and informal usage
    has blurred considerably (though not enough for Spartans to
    bug Athenians). The distinction still exists, however, and
    careful writers pay attention to it.
    
    MEANING 253
    
    ‘bedlivi Maileg
    
    Finally, we shall discuss the point with which we began—the
    purpose a word is chosen to serve. This aspect we shall call
    the "telic mode" of meaning, from the Greek word telos,
    meaning "end," and the Latin modus, meaning "manner."
    Though the phrase sounds forbidding, it is a useful brief label
    for an obvious but important fact: that part of a word's mean-
    ing is the purpose it is expected to fulfill, and that words may
    serve different purposes.
    
    To get a bit further into this matter it will help to look at
    a well-known diagram called the "communication triangle":

    WRITER. ~~ SOOSOt™C~C~CSSSSSSO READER
    
    The diagram simply clarifies the fact that any act of com-
    munication involves three things: someone who communi-
    cates (for our purposes, a writer); something the communi-
    cation is about (the topic); and someone to whom the
    communication is made (the reader). The broken lines joining-
    these elements indicate an indirect relationship between
    them.
    
    It is indirect because it must be mediated by words. Di-
    rectly, each corner of the triangle connects only to words. The
    writer selects them, the reader interprets them, and the topic
    is expressed by them. Words thus occupy a central, essential,
    mediating position in the triangle:
    
    DICTION
    
    WRITER READER
  - |-
    In selecting his or her words, a writer may be concerned primarily with any of the three areas of the triangle: writer-topic, writer-reader, or writer-peaker. These correspond to the three functions of meaning. We shall call them respectively: "referential," "interpersonal," and "directive."
    
    eee eee eee eee eee
    
    WRITER READER,
    
    The Referential Mode
    
    Referential meaning connects writer and topic. In this mode the writer chooses words for exactness and economy with which they signify, or refer to, what he or she observes, knows, thinks, sees—that is in his or her mind.
    
    Most writing involves chiefly this mode of meaning. Here are three examples:
    
    MEANING 255
    
    Mary [Queen of Scots] had returned to Scotland in 1561, a widow of nineteen, after an absence of thirteen years in France. ... D. Harris Wilson
    
    The principle of verification is supposed to furnish a criterion by which it can be determined whether or not a sentence is literally true. ... A. J. Ayer
    
    Calculus is a lousy subject. Student
    
    In all these cases the writers select words for their referential value, to make clear what is in their minds. The historian, aiming to be factually accurate, and the philosopher, aiming to be conceptually exact, chose diction on the basis of denotation: "in 1561," "a young widow of nineteen," "verification." The student, expressing how he feels, selects "lousy" for its connotation; and while it would be more difficult to unravel all the implications of "lousy" than to explain the meanings of "widow" or "criterion," the word is exactly right.
  - |-
    In each case, of course, the diction will affect readers' attitudes toward both subject and writer, and to that degree the words will operate in the interpretive and interpersonal modes. Ayer's abstract diction may well bore people interested in philosophy, for instance. A mathematician, depending on his sense of humor, might be amused or annoyed by the student's characterization of calculus. But although such spillover effects are very real, the fact remains that in all these examples the diction aims at referential accuracy and operates primarily in that mode of meaning.
    
    The Interpersonal Mode
    
    We choose words chiefly for their referential meanings. Those words, however, will also affect the link between readers and you. It follows that you should select even referential diction with an eye on the reader. You must consider what readers know and do not know, how they resemble you and how they differ, what degree of formality or informality you wish to establish with them. Such considerations may lead you, for example, to look for an easier word even though it is a bit less exact than a technical term.
    
    But beyond showing a general concern for readers in choosing the words with which you discuss your topic, you may also wish occasionally to include words that will directly affect the attitudes toward you. Now you are in the interpersonal mode of meaning.
    
    First, certain expressions create a favorable image of yourself. Inevitably you exist in your words whether to or not, a hidden voice of which readers are aware, sometimes dimly, sometimes with acute consciousness, and which we call the persona (see page 58). Since a persona is inevitable, you had better strive for an attractive one. Modesty, for instance, is generally a virtue in a writer. An occasional expression like I think, it seems to me, to my mind suggests to readers that here is a modest writer, undogmatic, aware of his or her fallibility. The following passages illustrate such interpersonal diction (the italics are added):
  - |-
    What, then, can one learn from [Samuel] Johnson in general? First, I think, the inestimable value of individuality. F. L. Lucas
    
    Whether this slowatig-doWreause a great or a small loss of national income is, / am told, a point on which expert economists are not agreed. Max Beerbohm
    
    That this is so can hardly be proved, but it is, / should claim, a fact. J. L. Austin
    
    Such personal disclaimers are not always a virtue. At times modesty may strike a note that is weak or false. At times a subject may demand an impersonal point of view, making the use of /, my, me impossible. Even when modesty is called for and a personal point of view is possible, a few I thinks and in my opinions go a long way. Used in every second or third
    
    MEANING
    
    sentence they may well draw too much attention and annoy the reader. Still, occasionally acknowledging your limitations is one way of creating a favorable impression upon readers. Beyond suggesting a déffabenttive persona, you
    
    can also use words in the interpersonal mode which graciously acknowledge your readers' presence. Without being insincere or obsequious you can draw readers into your exposition so that they seem to share more directly in your ideas and feelings. The judicious use of we, our, us, for instance, implies a common ground of knowledge and values, subtly flattering to readers (again, in the examples that follow italics are added):
    
    Let us define a plot. E. M. Forster
    
    No doubt, if one has more than one self (like most of us), it had better be one's better self that one tries to become. F. L. Lucas

    Any words, then, that refer to the writer in the role of
    writer or to the reader in the role of reader operate in the
    interpersonal mode of meaning. To the degree that such
    words create an attractive image of the former and graciously
    acknowledge the latter, they will add to the effectiveness of
    any piece of writing. In exposition, however, such diction,
    while important, necessarily remains infrequent.
    
    The Directive Mode of Meaning
    
    The last of the three modes of meaning relates to the reader-
    topic side of the communication triangle. Here you select
    words primarily for their value in assisting readers to under-
    stand or feel about the topic. Understanding and feeling are
    quite different responses: the former function of intelligence,
    the other of emotion. Words concerned with facilitating
    understanding we shall call constructive diction—tended to evoke emotion, emotive diction.
    
    Constructive diction includes the various connectives and
    signposts which clarify the organization of a composition and
    the flow of its ideas: however, even so, on the other hand, for
    example, in the next chapter, and so on. While such words
    and phrases indicate real connections within the topic, their
    essential function is to help readers follow the construction
    of thought.
    
    How much constructive diction you include in a compo-
    sition depends both upon the amount of help you think read-
    ers need and upon your own preferences for spelling out log-
    ical relationships or leaving them implicit. You can overuse
    such diction, boring or even annoying readers with too many
    however and therefore. Most people, however, are more
    likely to err on the other side, giving readers too little help.
    
    The other kind of interpretive diction aims at feeling. In
    emotive diction, connotations play a major role, especially
    those carrying strong negative or positive charges. Examples
    about advertising copy. The word Brut on a man's co-
    logne tells us nothing referential, nothing about the product.
    Brut aims at our emotions. Cleverly combining strong macho
    connotations with others of sophistication and elegance, the
    name is intended to overcome masculine resistance to toilet-
    ties as "sissy" (or perhaps to appeal to women, who buy most
    of these products for their men).
  - |-
    Emotionally loaded diction is also the stock-in-trade of the political propagandist. The Marxist who writes of "the bourgeois lust for personal liberty" uses bourgeois (a leftist sneer word for all things pertaining to capitalism) and "lust" for their capacity to arouse disapproval in a socialist audience. Similarly the conservative who complains of "pinko liberals in Washington" employs rightist sneer words. Diction may also
    
    3. The sophistication and elegance derive from the French word brut—meaning "dry," "crisp"—on champagne labels. The macho connotation follows from the fact that brut is pronounced "brute."
    
    MEANING 259
    
    be loaded positively, calling forth feelings of affection and approval: "grass-roots Americanism," "old-fashioned flavor," "an ancient and glorious tradition."
    
    There is nothing wrong in trying to arouse the emotions of readers. It is the purpose for which the emotion is evoked that may be reprehensible, or admirable. The devil's advocate uses loaded diction, and so do the angels.
    
    Many words operate in both the referential and directive modes simultaneously. In fact, it is not always easy to know which mode is paramount in particular cases. Both Marxist and conservative, for example, may believe that bourgeois and pinko really denote facts. Still, most of us feel that such words are largely empty of reference and have their meaning chiefly in their emotive force. On the other hand, some words work effectively in both modes, like those italicized in the following passage (the author is describing some fellow passengers on a bus tour of Sicily):
    
    Immediately next to me was an aggrieved French couple with a small child who looked around with a rat-like malevolence. He had the same face as his father. They looked like very cheap microscopes. Lawrence Durrell
    
    "Rat-like" and "cheap microscopes" have genuine reference; they would help an illustrator drawing a picture of this father and son. At the same time the words arouse the emotional response that Durrell wants in the reader.
    
    Conclusion
  - |-
    The relative importance of the three modes of meaning varies considerably from one kind of writing to another. Scholarly and scientific papers, for example, make the writer-topic axis paramount; advertising and political propaganda use that of reader-topic; applications for jobs and letters of appeal, for example, lie along the writer-reader axis. We can suggest such differences in emphasis in our triangular diagram by moving
    
    260 DICTION
    
    the circles representing words from the center of the triangle toward one or another of its sides. Some of the examples we have used might be visualized like this:
    
    Some expressions (in 156/, for instance) are chosen solely for reference, that is to explain the topic; a few solely to in-
    fluence fealiegs' about the topic (Brut). Other words
    function in two areas of meaning: either primarily within one
    but extending partially into another (pinko, bourgeois, I think,
    young widow), or more evenly balanced (rat-like).
    
    But whether designed to serve a single end or several, dic-
    tion succeeds only to the degree that it does in fact serve an
    endadensalbingomprehend your observations,
    ideas, feelings, and affecting their responses both to the topic
    and to you in ways that you wish. To the degree that it fails
    to achieve your purpose, your diction fails entirely.'
    
    4. A purpose itself may be silly or stupid, of course, but then the fault lies in
    the writer's bonaephiomantshts in the say—not diction—
    how itis said. Writers may use words well by a happy chance, that is, without
    really understanding their effédtjus achieve a purpose they are blind to.
    
    But lucky prose is rare. The general truth holds: good diction is diction chosen
    to achieve a conscious purpose.
    
    MEANING 261
    
    You must, finally, realize that words inherently have mean-
    ing in some or in all of the modes we have enumerated. If you
    do not choose words wisely, words will, in effect, choose you,
    saying things about the topic you do not intend and affecting
    readers in ways you do not want.
    
    CHAPTER
    
    Clarity and Simplicity
    
    To be effective words must be precise. Precision means that
    words serve your paurtbasethethaxpress exactly
  - |-
    What you think or feel or see or hear. Precision also establishes an appropriate relationship between you and your readers and guides their responses. But in exposition precision is largely a matter of expressing your topic clearly.
    
    That is more complicated than it sounds. It is not simply a question of deciding what you perceive or think or know or feel, and then of choosing appropriate words. The distinction between what goes on in our minds and how we put it into language is not that clear-cut. Words both limit and reveal reality. We do not so much "choose" words to fit our perceptions and ideas, as we see and think in terms of the words we know. To be more exact, the two processes—thinking, knowing, seeing, feeling, on the one hand; and using words, on the other hand— are interconnected. The process of acquiring new words increases our capacity to understand ourselves and the world around us; and as our sensitivity to self and the world expands, we seek words that will express the subtler, more complicated persons we are becoming.
    
    Therefore, sentences are important; paragraphing and clear organization are important. But words are fundamental. The essential virtue of words is that they be clear. At the same time it is desirable that they be simple, concise, and original. To a considerable degree these virtues overlap: words that are simple and concise will be clear. Yet there are occasions when these qualities of diction work at cross purposes. Sometimes, for example, the need to be exact will override the need to be simple or concise. But in general you should aim first at clarity, then strive for simplicity and concision.
    
    In this and the next two chapters we'll consider how to use words well. First, we look chiefly at clarity and simplicity; next at concision; and finally at original, unusual diction which gives extraordinary power and perceptiveness to writing.
    
    Here, then, are some things to keep in mind as you struggle to use words clearly and simply.
    
    Concreteness and Abstraction
  - |-

    Abstract words signify things that cannot be directly perceived: honor, for instance, is an abstract word, as are generosity or idea or democracy. Concrete words refer to perceptible things: a rose, a clap of thunder, the odor of violets.
    
    No hard-and-fast distinction exists between abstract and concrete. Often it is a matter of degree. Depending on its context the same term may now be used abstractly, now concretely, like rose in these sentences:
    
    CONCRETE On the hall table a single yellow tea rose stood
    in a blue vase.
    
    LESS CONCRETE Roses were growing in the garden.
    
    ABSTRACT The rose family includes many varieties.
    
    The closer a word comes to naming a single, unique object
    the more concrete it is. When diction moves from the specific
    and perceptible to the general and imperceptible, it becomes
    abstract.
    
    Do not suppose that abstract diction is necessarily a fault.
    264 DICTION
    
    If you deal with ideas, abstraction is inevitable. The following
    sentence is clear and concise, and almost all of its important
    words are abstract, yet they are essential to its clarity:
    
    All too often the debate about the place, purpose, and usefulness
    of films as a means of instruction is clouded by confusion, defen-
    siveness, and ignorance. Sol Worth
    
    Even when dealing with ideas, however, wise writers do
    not stay too long on high levels of abstraction, especially if
    aiming at readers who do not share their expertise. They
    know that many readers find it hard to enjoy or understand
    words remote from the eyes and ears. Occasionally; they
    make us "see" and "hear" ideas by using images in the form
    of examples, analogies, similes, or metaphors. In the following
    case the abstract tone of extremes is
    distinguished from concrete, visual reality in the image,' "a very
    flat country":
    
    It is often said truly, though perhaps not understood rightly, that
    extremes meet. But the strange thing is that extremes meet, not so
    much in being extraordinary, as in being dull. The country where
    the East and West are one, is a very flat country. c. Chesterton
  - |-
    And in the following description of a Japanese train crew,
    notice how the abstract terms "trim" and "dapper" are made
    perceptible:
    
    Everything about them is trim and dapper; the stylized flourishes of
    the white gloved guard, for instance, as he waves the flag for the
    train to start from Sano station, or the precise unfumbling way the
    conductor, in equally clean white gloves, clips one's ticket, arms
    slightly raised, ticket held at the correct angle and correct distance
    from the body, clipper engaged and operated in a sharp single
    movement. Ronald P. Dore
    
    1. An image is a word that refers to something we can sense—that
    hears, touch, and so on. See pages 23 for a fuller discussion.
    CLARITY AND SIMPLICITY 265
    
    If unrelieved abstraction can be a fault even when writing
    about abstract subjects, it is a far worse fault when writing
    about a subject that is not abstract at all. When you describe
    what you see, hear, touch and taste, use the most specific,
    concrete words you know:
    
    TOO ABSTRACT The large coves are surrounded by various
    buildings.
    
    MORE CONCRETE The large coves are surrounded by summer cottages, boat houses, and piers jutting into the
    water.
    
    EVEN BETTER The large coves are surrounded by summer cottages, trimly painted, with bright red and blue
    and green shutters; by boat houses, a few seeming about to slide into the lake, but most still used and well-maintained; and by piers
    jutting into the water, in good repair with sturdy railings, from which hang clean white life-rings.
    
    Inexperienced writers often complain, "I haven't anything
    to write about." There's plenty to write about; all you have
    to do is look and listen.
    
    Specificity
    
    Aside from being concrete or abstract, words may also be
    general or specific. Here, too, it is a matter of degree. A general word designates a class: for example, "dog" is a general
    word, while "golden retriever" is a specific word.
  - |-
    (Or generic) term for all kinds of feelings. Fear is more specific, and terror, a particular kind of fear, more specific still. It is a common error to pick words that mean too much, to name an entire class when what you wish to signify is something less:
    
    Thrift is not one of their attributes. (For virtues)
    
    The novel has far too many people. (For characters)
    
    266 DICTION
    
    Hardy's poem allows the reader to experience the crashing of the iceberg and the ship. (For forces or makes)
    
    On the other hand, there is nothing inherently wrong with general words. Sometimes you do want to refer to any or all feelings and then emotion is exactly the right word. If you mean humanity in general and not men or women or adults or Americans or Norwegians, then write
    
    People differ considerably in their religious beliefs.
    
    Ambiguity
    Ambiguity means that a word can be read in either of two ways and the context does not make clear which way is intended. (The term ambiguity is sometimes also applied when three or more interpretations are possible.)
    
    Ambiguity often is the result of a word's having two different senses:
    
    It was a funny affair. ("Laughable" or "strange"?)
    
    He's mad. ("Crazy" or "angry"?)
    
    Large abstractions are often ambiguous, particularly if they involve value judgments. Words like democracy, romantic, and Christian encompass a wide range of meanings, some of them contradictory. A writer, or a reader, can easily make mistakes with such words, sliding unconsciously from one sense to another, an error which logicians call equivocation.
    
    Pronouns may be ambiguous if it is not clear which of two possible antecedents they refer to:
    
    Children often anger parents; they won't talk to them.
    
    We sat near the heater, as it was cold. (The "heater" or the un-
    niendioned
    
    CLARITY AND SIMPLICITY 267
  - |-
    Some connectives are prone to ambiguity. Or, for instance,
    can signify (1) a logical disjunction, that is, A or B but not
    both; and (2) an alternative name or word for the same thing:
    "The shag, or cormorant, is a common sea bird along the New
    England coast." Because after a negative statement may also
    be ambiguous:
    
    We didn't go because we were tired. ("We did not go and the
    reason was that we were tired"; or, emphatically, "We did go and
    we certainly were not tired"?)
    
    On other occasions ambiguity lurks, not in a single word,
    but in an entire statement:
    
    I liked this story as much as liked all his others. ("I like all his
    stories, including this one"; or "I don't like any of his stories, in-
    cluding this one"?)
    
    So be it, until Victory is ours, and there is no enemy, but Peace.
    ("... there is no enemy, and now we have Peace"; or"... there
    is no enemy except Peace"?)
    
    Clever writers exploit ambiguity as a kind of irony, seem-
    ing to say one thing while meaning another. Joan Didion, in
    the following description of a wedding, wryly comments on
    marriage by using "illusion" both in its technical, dressmak-
    ing sense of a bridal veil and in its more commonplace mean-
    ing of a false hope or dream:
    
    A coronet of seed pearls heldilusion veil.
    
    And the nineteenth-century statesman and novelist Benjamin
    Disraeli had a standard response to all would-be authors who
    sent him unsolicited manuscripts:
    
    Many thanks; $hall lose no time in reading it.
    
    268 DICTION
    
    Connotation
    
    The connotation of a word is its fringe or associated mean-
    ings, including implications of approval or disapproval. (See
    pages 179 ff.) When a connotation pulls awkwardly against
    the context, even though the basic meaning of the word fits,
    the term must be replaced. In the following sentence, for ex-
    ample, unrealistic has the wrong connotations for the writer's
    purpose:
    
    In such stories it is exciting to break away from the predictable
    world we live in and to enter an unrealistic world where anything
    can happen.
  - |-
    The problem is that the writer approves of the story because  
    it stimulates the imagination. But usually unrealistic connotes  
    disapproval ("Don't be so unrealistic"; "Her plan is too un-  
    realistic to work"). Thus while the basic meaning (or deno-  
    tation) of unrealistic fits, its connotations do not. Such terms  
    gastastic, unpredictable, imaginary, bewonder-filled would  
    more appropriate.
    
    Barbarisms
    
    A barbarism is either a nonexistent word or an existing one  
    used ungrammatically. Inventing new words is not necessarily  
    a fault; imaginative writers create them, called neologisms,  
    
    But a genuine neologism fills a need. When an invented  
    word is merely an ungrammatical form of a term already in  
    the language, it serves no purpose and is a barbarism:  
    
    She's always been a déutifhtérd (For dutiful)
    
    Barbarisms are often spawned by confusion about suffixes,  
    those endings which extend the meaning or alter the gram-  
    matical function of example, when -ness turns  
    the adjective polite into the mafwaness.  
    
    CLARITY AND SIMPLICITY 269
    
    Sometimes a barbarism is the result of adding a second,  
    unnecessary suffix to a word to restore it to what it was in  
    the first place:  
    
    He has great drobitimbéiess.  
    
    The story contains a great deal of satiricainess. (For satire)
    
    Aside from nonexistent words, barbarisms also include le-  
    gitimate ones used ungrammatically. Confusion of sound or  
    appearance often causes this error:  
    
    Garbage is also used to fill holes were houses are to be built. (For  
    where)
    
    The average man is not conscience of his wasteful behavior. (For  
    conscious)
    
    I should of gone. (For should've)
    
    A women stocd on the corner. (For woman)
    
    The chances of confusion are even greater with homonyms,  
    different words pronounced the same (and sometimes spelled  
    alike as well): bear ("carry"), bear ("animal"), and bare ("na-  
    ked"). Especially prone to misuse are the forms there (ad-  
    verb), their (possessive pronoun), and they're (contraction of  
    they are); and to (preposition), too (adverb), and two  
    (adjective).
  - |-
    Legitimate words may become barbarisms when misused in grammatical shifts. As we'll see in the next chapter, grammatical shifts can be valuable in writing. (It means changing the normal grammatical function of a word, turning a noun, for example, into a verb, as in "The car nosed down the street.") But if it serves no valid purpose, such a shift is simply a barbarism:
    
    Our strive for greatness is one of our best qualities. (For striving)
    
    They made their deciding. (For decision)
    270 DICTION
    
    Awkward shifts are common with adjectives and adverbs. Usually the problem is leaving off a necessary-ly:
    
    She dances beautiful. (For beautifully)
    
    They did it satisfactory. (For satisfactorily)
    
    A rough rule is that adverbs of three or more syllables end in -ly that those having one or two syllables are rather idomatic: some always end (-ly), others never do (-ly), and still others may be used either way (slow or slowly, quick or quickly).
    
    On the fringe of barbarism are many trendy words such as finalize and adverbs ending in -wise such as weatherwise, unwearablewise. There seems little justification for a word like finalize, which says nothing that complete or finish does not say. On the other hand, one can argue that weatherwise is at least more concise than the phrase in regard to the weather. One's tolerance for such terms depends on how liberal or conservative one is with regard to language (or languagewise).
    
    Idiom
    
    An idiom is a combination of words functioning as a unit of meaning, as in "to take the subway [bus, streetcar] home." Often one or more of the words has a special sense different from its usual meaning and confined to that idiom. Thus to take here means "to get on and travel in." In its idiomatic sense such a word cannot be replaced by any of its usual equivalents: we cannot Urarry, or fetch the subway home."
  - |-
    Idioms are always a difficulty in learning foreign languages.
    They are not easily reduced to rules and each must be mem-
    orized. Even native speakers make mistakes with idioms. The
    most frequent errors involve verb-preposition combinations:
    CLARITY AND SIMPLICITY 271
    
    I complained with my parents about their attitude.
    IDIOMATIC: complained to
    
    She concluded in saying....
    IDIOMATIC: concluded by
    
    That is where we fool ourselves of our efficiency.
    IDIOMATIC: fool ourselves about
    
    They can't decide what to do with their problem.
    IDIOMATIC: do about their problem
    
    Errors like these probably come from confusing two idioms
    {complain about and argue with, for example), or from se-
    lecting an inappropriate one of several possible verb-
    preposition idioms (we do with physical objects—‘"What
    shall we do with this wase@3-ehutt problems,
    
    difficulties, abstractions of various khallswe‘&What
    
    about that crack in the vase?").
    
    Although they are most likely with verbs and prepositions,
    mistakes in idiom occur with other grammatical patterns.
    Some verbs, for instance, do not combine idiomatically with
    certain objects:
    
    People only /ook out for prestige. (Prestige is looked for, valued,
    esteemed.)
    
    Robert Frost gives the image of a silken tent in a field. (Poets create
    or develop images.)
    
    Adjectives and nouns also enter into idiomatic combina-
    tions:
    
    We have a great standard of living.
    IDIOMATIC: high
    
    The English prefer dining-room comedy.
    IDIOMATIC: drawing-room comedy
    272 DICTION
    
    Colloquial and Pretentious Diction
    
    Colloquialisms are expressions appropriate to informal, con-
    versational occasions. In writing they may sound out of
    place:
    
    We have a swell professor of mathematics.
    BETTER: nice, interesting, pleasant
    
    Colloquial words are a problem when they fit awkwardly
    with their contexts or when they are vague. And frequently
    colloquialisms are vague. (What, for example, does swe/l mean
    in the sentence above?) In speech we compensate for verbal
    vagueness by gestures, tone of voice, the common ground of
    knowledge and experience we share with our friends. None
    of these aids to communication is available to the writer.
  - |-
    On the other hand, some colloquialisms are remarkably expressive, and these are more acceptable now than they were a generation ago, when writers were more scrupulous about levels of usage. Today, we feel freer to mix formal words and colloquial ones. The result, if controlled by word sense and taste, is a clear gain in precision and variety (italics added in both cases):
    
    Joan's voices and visions have played tricks with her reputation.
    George Bernard Shaw
    
    There's another wrinkle to this. Elizabeth Janeway
    
    An extreme form of colloquialism is slang. We all use slang, and we all recognize it. But we find it very difficult to define.
    Sometimes slang is an ordinary word given a special meaning: heavy in the sense of serious, or cool in the sense of unper-
    turbed or a little better than all right. Other slang terms occur only as Sbarigstenead,
    
    Slang tends to be short-lived: that of one generation sounds silly to the next. (There are exceptions; some slang terms are
    notably lekag-hivsiinedoeagds also to be
    
    richly suggestive in meaning, conveying a wide range of at-
    titudes and responses and values in a brief expression (square,
    hep). But the richness is likely to hide an imprecision: often
    we feel that a slang term says exactly what we want to say,
    but we find it very difficult to explain what that something
    is.
    
    Even more than colloquialisms, slang has an air of infor-
    mality. That tone can be useful, helping to create a good
    writer-reader relationship or a likable persona. Used intelli-
    gently, an occasional bit of slang will not only say exactly the
    right thing but also please us by its novelty (italics added):
    
    The authors had a reputation for being jealous of each other's fame
    and losing no opportunity of putting the boot in [kicking a fallen
    Opponent].... Frank Muir
    
    I don't mean to suggest that Segal is as gaga as this book [Love
    Stoayja-pantyof him is. Pauline Kael
    
    Pretentiousness
  - |-
    Pretentiousness is using big words to no purpose (except perhaps to show off). It results in long-winded, wooden sentences filled with deadwood. Shorter, simpler words mean shorter, clearer sentences:
    
    Upon receiving an answer in the affirmative, he proceeded to the bulletin board.
    BETTER: Told yes, he went to the bulletin board.
    
    Television shows which demonstrate participation in physical exercise will improve your muscle tone.
    BETTER: Television exercise shows improve your muscle tone.
    
    Remember, though, that not all unusual or learned terms are a flaw, even when they could be replaced by simpler ones. Skillful writers employ uncommon words to draw attention or to imply a subtlety. Here, for instance, a learned word wittily conceals a vulgar insult:
    
    Among those who distrust the [literary] critic as an intrusive middleman, edging his vast steatopygous bulk between author and audience, it is not uncommon to wish him away, out of the direct line of Vision. Carlos Baker
    
    Cliches and Jargon
    A cliche is a trite expression, one devalued by overuse:
    
    an agonizing reappraisal the bottom line
    
    at this point in time the finer things of life
    cool, calm, and collected the moment of truth
    history tells us the voice of the people
    
    Many cliches are simply stale phrases:
    
    cool as a cucumber Mother Nature
    
    dead as a doornail pleased as Punch
    gentle as a lamb sober as a judge
    
    happy as a lark the patience of Job
    
    in the pink the pinnacle of success
    light as a feather white as snow
    
    Cliches are dull and unoriginal. Worse, they impede clear perception, feeling, or thought. Cliches are verbal molds into which we force experience. Instead of shaping reality for ourselves, we accept it, and pass it on, precast (and probably miscast).
  - |-
    Cliches, however, ought not to be confused with dead metaphors. Expressions like the key to the problem of the matter, the mouth of the river ever were clichés, are so no longer. They are simply old metaphors long dead and now useful, everyday diction. A cliche attempts to be original and perceptive but fails. A dead metaphor, on the other hand, makes no pretense to newness; it has dried and hardened into a useful expression for a common idea.
    
    A special kind of cliche is the euphemism, which softens or conceals a fact considered improper or unpleasant. Euphemisms for death include to pass away, to depart this life, to go to that big house, and the trite "eternal rest." Similarly, for sexual matters, and diseases are often named euphemistically. Politicians, diplomats, advertisers are adept with euphemisms:
    
    dedication to public service = "personal ambition," a frank exchange of views = "continued disagreement," tired blood = "anemia."
    
    Jargon
    
    Jargon is technical language misused. Technical language, the precise diction demanded by any specialized trade or profession, is necessary when experts communicate with one another. It becomes jargon when it is applied outside the limits of technical discourse. Jargon is really a kind of pretentiousness, a learned and mysterious language designed to impress the nonexpert:
    
    Given a stockpile of innovative in-house creativity for the generation of novel words, substituting members for the input of letters whenever feasible, and fiscally optimized by computer capacity for targeting in on core issues relating to aims, goals, and priorities, and learned skills, we might at last be freed from our dependence on the past.
  - |-
    This is in fact a parody by Lewis Thomas, a biologist who does not write jargon. It catches the faults of jargon perfectly: the abstract, polysyllabic Latinism (capacitization, optimized); the trendy word (creativity, in-house, input, core issues); the pointless redundancy (aims, goals, and priorities); and the awesome combination of anollifeeréwords (innovative in-house creativity, computer capacitization).
    
    At its worst jargon is incomprehensible. (The word originally meant the twittering of birds.) Even when it can be puzzled out, jargon is nothing more than puffed-up language, a kind of false profundity in which simple ideas are padded out in polysyllabic dress.
    
    Awkward Figures
    
    Figures of speech are words used less for their literal meaning than for their capacity to clarify or intensify feelings or ideas. For the writer of exposition the most common and important figures are the simile and metaphor.
    
    A simile is a comparison, generally introduced by like or as. The essayist Robert Lynd describes the bleak houses of a nineteenth-century city as looking "like seminaries for the production of killjoys." A metaphor is more complicated. For now let us say only that it expresses an implicit comparison, not a literal one (as a simile does):
    
    When Walked to the mailbox, a song sparrow placed his incomparable seal on the outgoing letters. E. B. White
    
    White does not literally say that the bird's song is like a bright stamp or seal, but the comparison is there.
    
    In Chapter 27 we look at figures at greater length and in a more positive light (see page 213 ff.). Here we are concerned with their misuse. A metaphor or simile can be faulty in any of three ways: it can be inappropriate, mixed, or overwhelming.
    
    Mixed metaphors ask us to perceive simultaneously two things that simply cannot go together:
    
    He put his foot in his mouth and jumped off the deep end. We must feel with the fingertips of our eyeballs.
    
    Inappropriate figures contain implications that do not fit the context and are likely to imply meanings the writer does not intend:
  - |-
    A green lawn spread invitingly from the road to the house, with a driveway winding up to the entrance like a snake in the grass.
    
    Since the writer intended no sinister implications, comparing the driveway to a snake is misleading. Moreover, the simile, aside from being misleading and trite, is ridiculous. A snake in the grass is a kinetic image in one motion—and a wriggling driveway is silly.
    
    Overwhelming figures ride roughshod over the main idea, as in the following sentence (about the considerable girth of the comedian Jackie Gleason):
    
    Out of that flesh grew benign tumors of driving energy and unsatisfied appetite that stuck to his psyche and swelled into a galloping disease that at once blights and regenerates him.
    
    False Hyperbole
    
    Hyperbole (often shortened to hype in modern usage) is deliberate exaggeration intended to intensify importance or emotional force. Though no hyperbole is ever intended to be taken literally, we may properly call it false only when the exaggeration far outdistances the real value of the idea or feeling:
    
    Football is the most magnificent sport ever developed by the mind of man. It tests physical skill, stamina, courage, and intelligence more thoroughly than any other human activity.
    
    One shudders to think of what the world would have been like if Shakespeare had never written The Tempest.
    
    Although these are silly exaggerations, hyperbole can be used legitimately. It is an old and useful figure of speech (though not as fashionable today as it once was). In the nineteenth century politicians delighted in spread-eagle oratory, and historians cultivated a hyperbolical style. In the following passage, for example, the American historian William H. Prescott
    
    writes about the ill effects of the gold which Spain had expropriated from the New World in the 1500s:
    
    The golden tide, which, permitted a free vent, would have fertilized the region, through which it poured, now buried the land under a deluge which blighted every green and living thing.
    
    Mark Twain was a master of hyperbole, as he reveals in this description of a tree after an ice storm:

    ... it stands there the acme, the climax, the supremest possibility
    in art or nature, of bewildering, intoxicating, intolerable magnifi-
    cence. One cannot make the words strong enough.
    
    Twain is at his best when he uses ears—when
    hyperbole for comic effect:
    
    [On the New England weather] time spring have counted one
    hundred and thirty-six different kinds of weather inside of four-and-
    twenty hours.
    
    [On the music of Richard Wagner] Another time we went to Mann-
    heim and attended a siti Vir@a-—otherwise opera—called
    engrin." The banging and slamming and booming and crashing
    were beyond belief, the racking and pitiless pain of it remains
    stored up in my memory alongside the memory of the time had
    my teeth fixed.
    
    Repetitiousness
    
    A word, unless it is important, will sound awkward if it is
    repeated too closely. It ought to be replaced by a synonym
    or a pronoun:
    
    The auto industry used to produce cars that lasted, but they didn't
    make enough profit so planned obsolescence came into use.
    BETTER: ... came into fashion.
    
    CLARITY AND SIMPLICITY 279
    
    This narrative is narrated by a narrator whom we cannot completely
    trust.
    BETTER: This story is told by a narrator whom we cannot completely
    trust.
    
    However, repetitiousness must be distinguished from le-
    gitimate restatement, in which words are repeated for em-
    phasis or clarity:
    
    He [a lax governor] took things easy, and his fellow freebooters
    took everything easily. Carter Hodding
    
    [Oliver Goldsmith's "The Deserted Village" is] a poem written not
    in ink but in tears, a rich suffusion of emotion rising up in a grubby
    room in Grub street for a grubby little Irish village.
    
    Sean O'Faolain
    
    The line between awkward repetition and effective restate-
    ment is not easy to draw. As a general rule, a repeated word
    should be important, able to stand the attention readers will
    give it.
    
    Awkward Sound
  - |-
    We choose words primarily for what they mean, but we must
    remember that words are also units of sound and rhythm.
    Even people adept at silent reading will be put off by awk-
    ward patterns of sound, though they may not realize exactly
    what bothers them. Most often the problem is an accidental
    repetition of the same sound:
    
    There is a growing awareness of the slowing down of growth af-
    fectirezonomy.
    
    BETTER: There is a growing awareness that diminished rates of
    growth are affecting our economy.
    
    Built-in obsolescence has become the essence of our society.
    BETTER: ... has become the basis of our society.
      
    280 DICTION
    
    At the top of the hide three fine pine trees standing in a line.
    BETTER: ... three beautiful pine trees in a row.
    
    But it is also true (as we saw on pages 153-54) that rhyme,
    the deliberate repetition of sound, has a place in prose, as in
    this example:
    
    ... those Hairbreadth Harrys of History [who] save the world just
    when it's slipping into the abyss. Arthur Herzog
    
    As is often the case with diction, it is not easy to separate
    vice from virtue. Generally, rhyme is awkward when it is ac-
    cidental or Whenteevelnvioudehberate—it
    heavy-handed. Effective rhyme involves key terms and does
    not shout.
    
    The best guard against awkward repetition of sound is to
    read your work aloud. If words jar your ear, change them.
      
    CHAPTER
    
    Concision
    
    Concision is brevity relative to purpose, as we saw in Chapter
    20. There we looked at concision as an aspect of sentence
    structure. Here we consider it from the point of view of dic-
    tion. When you fail to be concise the result is deadwood,
    words that perform no useful function and simply get in the
    way of those that do. This chapter is about where deadwood
    comes from and how it may be avoided.
    
    Psychological Factors
  - |-
    Verbal profundity is the fallacy that words which look impressive must mean a lot. The person, for example, who exclaimed of a painting that it exhibits "orderly and harmonious juxtapositions of color patterns" seemed to be saying a great deal. But if the words mean anything more than "color harmony," it is difficult to say.
    
    Closely related to verbal profundity is the desire for elegance, often a variety of what in the last chapter we called pretentious diction. A sentence like
    
    A worker checks the watch's time-keeping performance.
    
    is an attempt to cast a verbal spell over the job of quality control in a watch factory. This is shorter, simpler, and clearer:
    
    A worker checks the watch's accuracy.
    
    Confusion about the subject also leads to wordiness:
    
    Music is similar to dress fads in that its styles change from time to time. Perhaps the change is subtle, but no one style of music will remain on top for a very long time. I am not talking about classical music, but rather about popular music that appeals to the majority of young people.
    
    This writer did not begin with word specific enough before the subject. He chose too general a term ("music"). The final sentence reveals that he himself felt the problem, for he spends twenty words explaining what kind of music he means. How much easier to have begun
    
    Popular music is similar to dress fads...
    
    Sometimes deadwood stems from ignorance of words. That's the problem here:
    
    In this novel, part of the theme is stated directly in so many words, and part is not so much said in specific words but is more or less hinted at.
    
    Had the writer known the terms explicit and implicit he could have made the point more clearly and concisely:
    
    In this novel, part of the theme is explicit, and part is implicit.
    
    A limited vocabulary is no disgrace. We all suffer that handicap, and education is the process of overcoming it. But while it may be pardonable, not knowing the right word often re-
  - |-
    Suits in obscurity daddwood. It helps to keep a list of
    pairs like explicit and implicit which enable you to make dis-
    tinctions quickly and neatly: extrinsic/intrinsic, concrete/ab-
    stract, actwtled ealmbtotute/relative
    
    Finally, excessive caution contributes to deadwood. Some
    people are afraid to express anything as certain. They will
    write:
    
    It seems that Columbus discovered the New World in 1492.
    
    Certainly some things call for caution. But no one can lay
    down a blanket rule about when qualification is necessary and
    when it is verbose. We'll consider the question in closer detail
    later in the chapter; for the moment remember that extreme
    caution in writing is more often a vice than a virtue.
    
    A false sense of what is significant, confusion about what
    you want to say, ignorance of words, and timidity, then, are
    some of the psychological factors leading to deadwood. In
    practice, they are manifested in either of two ways: circum-
    locution, using too many words to say something; andit-
    lessness, saying something that doesn't need to be said at all.
    
    Circumlocution
    > Avoid Mi¢aningteserbs
    
    English often conveys subtleties by stringing verbs:
    I was going to go tomorrow.
    
    Here the verbs are justified by the meaning (that a planned
    future action is now uncertain or negated). But when a string
    of verbs says nothing that cannot be said with equal clarity
    or force in fewer words, the result is deadwood:
    
    The current foreign situation should serve to start many Americans
    to begin thinking.
    BETTER: ... should start many Americans thinking.
    
    Nucleonics investigates the smaller particles that go to make up the
    nucleus of the atom.
    BETTER: ... that make up the nucleus of the atom.
    
    A special case of empty verb strings is the awkward passive
    construction. The focus of thought or tact may make the pas-
    sive voice necessary. Generally, however, you should write in
    the active voice. Overuse of the passive lards sentences with
    empty words:
    
    The writer's point must be clearly stated by him at the beginning
    of the paragraph.
    
    BETTER: The writer must clearly state his point at the beginning of
    the paragraph.
  - |-
    The work must be done by her by tomorrow.
    BETTER: She must do the work by tomorrow.
    
    (In the last example, however, note that if one wished to emphasize "work," the passive would be justified.)
    
    > The Best Is Mandatory
    
    In practice this principle often boils down to not using a
    phrase if a word will do:
    
    She conducted herself in an irrational manner.
    BETTER: She conducted herself irrationally.
    BETTER YET: She acted irrationally.
    
    He didn't take the advice given to him by his doctor.
    BETTER: He didn't take his doctor's advice.
    
    It leaves us with the thought that. ...
    BETTER: It leaves us thinking that....
    
    A common kind of adjectival wordiness is using a full rel-
    ative clause to introduce a participle or adjective that could
    be attached directly to the noun:
    
    CONCISION 285
    
    This is the same idea that was suggested last week.
    BETTER: This is the same idea suggested last week.
    
    The family who are living in that house are my friends.
    BETTER: The family living in that house are my friends.
    
    In such clauses the relative word (that, which, who) acts as
    the subject and is immediately followed by a form of be which
    is, in turn, followed by a participle or adjective. The relative
    word is verb contribute nothing except to hook the
    adjective or participle to the noun. Occasionally clarity, em-
    phasis, or rhythm justify the whole clause. Mostly they do
    not.
    
    The direct, economic use of participles is a resource of style
    that inexperienced writers underuse. The economy also ap-
    plies to adverbial clauses, which can sometimes be boiled
    down to one or two operative words:
    
    Because they lacked experience, they didn't do a good job.
    BETTER: Lacking experience, they didn't do a good job.
    
    Now and then, independent clauses or separate sentences
    may be pruned and subordinated by means of participles:
    
    These ideas are out of date, and they don't tell us anything new.
    BETTER: These ideas are out of date, telling us nothing new.
    
    Participles are also more economical than gerunds (the
    nounal use of the -ing form of a verb; see page 114):
  - |-
    She worried about the cooking of the dinner.
    BETTER: She worried about cooking the dinner.
    
    Note, however, that you must consider meaning in such re-
    visions. "She worried about the cooking of the dinner" would
    make sense if someone else were doing the cooking.
    
    286 DICTION
    
    [> Specificity Means Concision
    
    Beginning with a word too general for your idea creates a
    need for wordy modification:
    
    People who enter college for the first time find it difficult to adjust
    to the teaching.
    
    "People" is too inclusive. To specify what kind of "people,"
    the writer must add seven words. English provides no single
    term meaning "people who enter college for the first time"
    (except matriculants, a Latinism too forbidding for this
    writer's purpose). Students, however, would be more precise
    than people, and freshmen, more precise still (even though
    second-semester freshmen are not, strictly speaking, entering
    college for the first time). With freshmen only one modifier
    is needed:
    
    College freshmen find it difficult to adjust to the teaching.
    
    While most frequent with nouns, failure to be specific oc-
    curs with verbs as well:
    
    The sudden change motivated him into a rage.
    BETTER: The sudden change enraged him.
    
    They emerged victorious.
    BETTER: They won.
    
    The too-general verb is often a form of he, have, or seem.
    When these merely link a noun or modifier to the subject,
    they can often be replaced by a more exact verb:
    
    The people were supportive of conservation.
    BETTER: The people supported conservation.
    
    Officers have to have a knowledge teéir men.
    BETTER: Officers have to know their men.

    He becomes self-conscious to the extent that he withdraws into himself.
    BETTER: He becomes so self-conscious that he withdraws into himself.
    
    Pointlessness
    
    Pointless words serve no purpose. They do not need to be made more concise; they need to be eliminated. There are two broad causes of pointless diction: (1) failing to credit readers' intelligence, and (2) failing to focus on the subject.
    
    Failing to Credit Readers' Intelligence
    
    Think about your readers, and avoid telling them what they already know or can easily infer from the context.
    
    Won't Define What Is Common Knowledge
    
    Accountants sometimes function as auditors (people from outside a company who check the books kept by the company's own accountants).
    
    288 DICTION
    
    All the italicized words in that sentence are dead. If readers understand "accountants" they can suppose that "auditors" requires definition. Gratuitous definitions not only make deadwood, but interfere with communication in another, more serious way.
    
    Insult their intelligence.
    
    Granted, it is not easy to decide when a word ought to be defined. In the following instance the naturalist Joseph Wood Krutch, writing for general readers, realizes that they will not understand geological terms and neatly explains what they need to know:
    
    To even the most uninstructed eye a scorpion fossilized during the Silurian or Devonian epoch, like three hundred million years ago, would almost certainly look like a scorpion.
    
    Ask yourself whether a definition is needed by the reader whom you have in mind. (And remember that it is not too much to ask people to look into a dictionary now and again.)
    
    [> Don't Spell Out What Is Clearly Implied
    
    Unless there is a clear chance of confusion, you do not have to state what is entailed in a word's meaning (the deadwood is italicized):
    
    Her dress was blue in color.
    He was very tall.
    
    Naumbadgtatival often contain deadwood caused by overexplicitness. In many cases the adjective is unnecessary:
    
    There is considerable danger involved.
    We question the methods employed.
    The equipment needed is expensive.

    Each pesya has a special purpose when it is used.
    This question has two sides to it.
    
    Most countries of the world have their own coinage.
    In other cases it is the noun that is dead:
    
    They committed an act of burglary.
    
    The quarterback is noted for his passing ability.
    It has existed for a long period of time.
    
    She was an unusual kind of child.
    
    The punt return resulted in a fumble situation.
    
    The last major barrier to the westward expansion movement was
    the Rocky Mountains.
    
    Categorizing words such as kind, sort, type, class, and so
    on are especially prone to dead use. Emphasis or tone will
    sometimes justify "He is the kind of man [that] he is wise, the more concise "He is a man who is preferable."
    
    Often in these noun-adjectival combinations, the adjectives
    can be used substantively, that is, as nouns:
    
    On quilts, silk patches replaced the homespun ones.
    BETTER: On quilts, silk patches replaced homespun.
    
    Verbs, too, hide implicit meanings, which, whether ex-
    pressed as a complement or a modifier, are often better left
    unsaid:
    
    She always procrastinates things.
    He tends to squint his eyes.
    
    I have been told by various people that smoking is sophisticated.
    
    290 DICTION
    
    Sometimes an idea is clearly implied by the total context
    rather than by any single word. Each of these phrases is dead:
    
    Writing poetry requires experience as well as sensibility. A prerequisite to writing poetry is being able to write prose.
    
    I dislike television. Most programs on television are unbelievable.
    
    A good personality will help anyone, no matter what profession he
    or she chooses in life.
    
    A special but frequent form of overexplicitness is the un-
    needed connective, especially common with conjunctive ad-
    verbs like however, therefore, furthermore, and so on. The
    following sentence does not really need the connective:
    
    People think that stamp collecting requires money; However, it
    doesn't.
    BETTER: People think that stamp collecting requires money; it
    doesn't.
    
    The negated verb establishes the contradiction, and removing
    "however" even strengthens the point.
  - |-
    Probably it is true that inexperienced writers use too few  
    conjunctive adverbs rather than too many. Even so, it pays  
    to check Anderss and Be sure thasnsequentlys.  
    you really need them, or rather, that your readers really need  
    them.
    
    It can be wordy and tiresome to spell out all the connec-  
    tions of your ideas. The same impulse can make you heavy-  
    handed in explaining your theereades+whelling  
    you're going to do next, or have just done, or won't do at all.  
    Such explanations are like scaffolding around a new building.  
    Scaffolding can be helpful in early drafts, enabling you to see  
    where you're going. But when they revise, experienced writ-  
    ers dismantle most of these planks and ladders. Some should

    they do not, where they can follow your progress for them-  
    selves, scaffolding gets in the way, obscuring thought as sta-  
    ging around a new building conceals its shape.
    
    Atrmountomemtifiechen emphasis—  
    is a particularly awkward kind of scaffolding. An overworked  
    formula is "Let me say" (variants: "Let me make clear," "Let  
    me explain," "Let me tell you something"). Be on guard  
    against pointless announcement at the beginning of a com-  
    position. Many readers react negatively to this sort of  
    opening:
    
    The essay that follows is about baseball. Specifically, it will deal  
    with the business ofgamragdioteague team.
    
    BETTER: Supporting every major league baseball team is a complex

    Good writers help their readers, but they do not assume that  
    readers are helpless.
    
    [> Avoid Empty Redundancy  
    Empty redundancy is pointless repetition. It is often found in  
    headwords and modifiers:

    vital essentials

    Unlike legitimate restatements for clarity or emphasis, such
    redundancies are awkward and illogical, special instances of
    not understanding what words mean. A phrase like "vital es-
    sentials" seems to imply that there are "essentials" which are
    not "vital," a contradiction. Can you "bisect" anything with-
    out cutting it "in half"? Can a man hang himself without
    292 DICTION
    
    "thereby taking his own life"? (Never mind the rope's break-
    ing; bang in such a context means to cause death.)
    
    Failing to Focus on the Subject
    
    Here deadwood comes from lering away from the topic,
    from pursuing irrelevancies:
    
    > Don't Open Up Topics You Will Not Develop
    Now an idea in itself may be interesting, but if it does not
    support your topic it is just deadwood:
    
    The people had come to the new world for freedom of several
    different kinds, and had found injustice instead.
    
    There is nothing inherently dead in "of several different
    kinds." But the writer does not discuss these kinds of freedom
    (nor does his subject require him to). To mention them at all,
    then, is a mistake. The phrase contributes nothing to the main
    point. Even worse, it mutes the contrast between the key
    terms "freedom" and "injustice" and misleads readers by
    pointing to a path of development they will not find.
    
    > Avoid the Distinction Without a Difference
    A pointless distinction is naming several varieties of some-
    thing when those varieties do not matter for your purpose:
    
    Under the honor system, teachers do not have to stand guard during
    exams, tests, and quizzes.
    
    There are of course real differences among exams, tests, and
    quizzes, and had the writer been concerned with the various
    modes of testing students must endure, the distinctions would
    have been vital. But in fact the topic is the honor system, and
    the distinction is empty. One word would do, probably
    "tests," the most general.
    CONCISION 293
    
    > Don't Overqualify
    It is worth saying again that excessive caution leads to dead-
    wood:
    
    Theater-in-the-round somewhat resembles an arena.
  - |-
    Why so cautious? Resembles does not mean "identical with";
    it doesn't need the protection of "somewhat." Writing so tim-
    idly is like holding up one's trousers with belt, suspenders,
    and several huge safety pins. As we discussed on pages 106-
    8, qualification is often necessary if you are to treat ideas
    without ignoring their complexity. But pointless qualification
    is wordy foolishness.
    
    The verbs seem and tend and the windy phrase can be said
    to be (in place of a simple is) often indicate overqualification:
    
    After a square dance the people are pretty tired, but it seems that
    when they have tried it once they want more.
    BETTER: ... but when they have tried it once they want more.
    
    This play tends to be a comedy.
    BETTER: This play is a comedy.
    
    Ethan can be said to be a tragic hero.
    BETTER: Ethan is a tragic hero.
    
    Another verb that is often deadwood is would. This aux-
    iliary does have legitimate uses for conditional action, for example:
    
    I would have gone if had known you were there.
    Or to anticipate a future effect:
    
    The defeat would ultimately prove disastrous.
    294 DICTION
    
    But when there is no question of doubt or conditionality or
    an anticipated future, would is a wasted word (and sometimes
    subtly misleading):
    
    That would be my brother at the door.
    BETTER: That is my brother at the door.

    Figurative Language
    
    Whenever language is simple, plain, direct, whenever it em-
    ploys words in their conventional meaning, we say that it is
    literal. Literal comes from the Latin litera, "letter"; what is
    literal is according to the letter. Consider, for example, this
    statement: "A writer's style should be purposive, not merely
    decorative." It is to be read literally: the words mean nothing
    more, and nothing less, than what they say.
  - |-
    The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.
    
    In figurative language the same idea has been expressed like this: "Style is the feather in the arrow, not the feather in the cap." Figurative means that a word has been stretched to accommodate a larger or even very different sense from that which it usually conveys. A writer can make this stretch because of a likeness between different concepts, a likeness the context reveals. Thus the literal meaning of "feather in the arrow" is the stabilizer that keeps the arrow straight; the figurative meaning is that style keeps prose on target.
    
    A writer must provide clues for readers so they may understand figurative words. In speech, we signal such meanings by gestures, facial expressions, pronunciation, or tone of voice (think of how we say "generous" to twist its sense to "stingy" when we say of a cheap acquaintance, "He's a generous guy!"). In writing, the context, the sentence, the paragraph, and even total edition—controls the word, making it fly in an unusual direction.
    
    Effective figures depend on total diction, on all your words. You do not improve writing by sticking in occasional similes or metaphors. They must be woven into prose. When they are, figures of speech add great richness. Look again at the comparison of style to the feathers of an arrow. It enhances meaning on at least four levels. First, it clarifies and concretizes an unfamiliar and abstract idea ("style") in a striking visual image. Second, it enlarges our conception of style, endowing style with the functions of the feather in the arrow (providing stability and guidance) and disassociating it from the qualities of a feather in a cap (vanity, pretentiousness, pointless decoration). Third, the figure implies judgment: that style in the "arrow-feather" sense is good, while style in the "hat-feather" sense is bad. Finally, the figure entertains: we take pleasure in the witty succinctness with which a complicated idea is made clearer and enriched by the image of the two feathers.

    Thus figures clarify, they expand and deepen meaning, they express feelings and judgments, and they are pleasurable. We observe these virtues over and over as we look at the more common figures of speech. The most frequent and most useful are similes and metaphors. Similes first.
    
    Similes
    A simile is a brief comparison, usually introduced by like or as. The preposition like is used when the following construction is a word or phrase:
    
    My words swirled around his head like summer flies.
    E. B. White
    
    The conjunction as introduces a clause, that is, a construction containing its own subject and verb:
    
    The decay of society was praised by artists as the decay of a corpse is praised by worms. G. K. Chesterton
    
    A simile consists of two parts: tenor and vehicle. The tenor is the primary subject of the figure, such as "the decay of society" and "artists" in Chesterton's. The vehicle is the thing to which the main subject is compared—"summer flies" and the "decay of a corpse" and "worms."
    
    Usually, though not invariably, the vehicle is, or contains, an image. An image is a word or expression referring to something we can perceive. "Summer flies," for example, is an image, primarily a visual one, though like many images it has a secondary perceptual appeal: we can hear the flies as well as see them.
    
    Vehicle commonly follows tenor, as in the two instances above. But the vehicle may come first, emphasizing the main subject by delay and also arousing our curiosity by putting the cart before the horse:
    
    Like a crack in a plank of wood which cannot be sealed, the difference between the worker and the intellectual was ineradicable in Socialism. Barbara Tuchman
    
    Most similes are brief, but they may be expanded—usually by breaking the vehicles into parts and applying each to the tenor. A historian, writing about the Italian patriot Garibaldi, explains that
  - |-
    His mind was like a vast sea cave, filled with the murmur of dark waters at flow and the stirring of nature's greatest forces, lit here and there by streaks of glorious sunshine bursting in through crevices hewn at random in its rugged sides.
    
    George MacAlKay
    
    Similes Clarify
    
    Similes have many uses. One is to clarify an unfamiliar idea or perception by expressing it in familiar terms:
    
    298 DICTION
    
    Cold air is heavy; as polar air plows into a region occupied by tropical aigets. underneath the warm air and lifts it up even
    
    as it pushes it back. A cold front acts physically like a
    COWCaitcher. Wolfgang Langewiesche
    
    Finding familiar equivalents often involves concretion,
    which is turning an abstraction into an image readers can
    imaginatively see or hear or touch. It has been said, for ex-
    ample, that the plot of one of Thomas Hardy's novels is
    
    as complicated as a medieval mousetrap. Virginia Woolf
    
    Even though few of us have seen a medieval mousetrap, the
    phrase cleverly suggests a labyrinthine Rube Goldberg
    contrivance.
    
    Occasionally the process may be reversed so that a simile
    abstracts, that is, moves from the concrete to the abstract:
    
    The taste of that crane soup clung to me all day like the memory
    of an old sorrow dulled by time. Jom c. Neiharat
    
    Then the apse [of a medieval cathedral] is pure and beautiful
    Gothic of the fourteenth century, with very tall and fluted windows
    like single prayers. Hilaire Belloc
    
    Similes can also be emphatic, especially when they close a
    sentence or passage, like those by Neihardt and Belloc.
    
    Similes Expand the Subject
    
    Most similes ever primarily function is to ex-
    
    phaome-dhan provide a perceptible equivalent of an
    
    abstract idea. Any vehicle comes with meanings of its own,
    and these enter into and enlarge the significance of the tenor.
    Ballasts "single prayers" does not help us to see the
    windows of the cathedral. But it does enlarge our conception
    of those windows, endowing them with the connotations we
    
    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 299
    
    associate with prayer: the upward lift of the spirit, the urge
    to transcend mortal limits.
  - |-
    Here are two other examples of similes rich in implication.
    
    The first one is from the old soldiers:
    
    "The easy phrases covered the cruelties of war, like sand blowing in
    over the graves of their comrades. Thomas Pakenham"
    
    The image suggests the capacity of the mind to obscure the
    horror of war, even in those, perhaps especially in those, who
    endured it.
    
    In this second example the novelist Bakesen is dis-
    cussing life on a farm in South Africa:
    
    "Sometimes visitors from Europe drifted into the farm like wrecked
    timbers into still waters, turned and rotated, till in the end they were
    washed out again, or dissolved and sank."
    
    The image implies a great deal about such drifters: their lack
    of will and purpose, the futility with which they float through
    life, their incapacity to anchor themselves to anything solid,
    their inevitable and unmarked disappearance.
    
    Clearly, one advantage of similes and figures
    of meaning. Compressing a range of ideas
    and feelings into few words, similes deepen prose.
    
    Similes Express Feelings and Judgments
    
    Many similes are emotionally charged. Pakenham's image of
    sand blowing over the graves of fallen soldiers, for example,
    is heavily freighted with sadness. And in the following figure
    the naturalist Rachel Carson does more than describe the
    summer sea; she reveals its beauty:
    
    Or again the summer sea may glitter with a thousand moving pin-
    pricks of light, like an immense swarm of fireflies moving through
    a dark wood.
    
    Emotional connotations often involve judgments. The poet
    Rupert Brooke, writing about a conversation with a salesman,
    imagines how the man's mind works:
    
    "The observer could see thoughts slowly floating into it, like carp in
    a pond."
    
    This simile operates on several levels: it translates an abstrac-
    tion (the process of thinking) into an arresting visual image.
    It suggests the slowness and ponderousness of this particular
    mind. And it implies a judgment, even if humorously: this is
    not a mind the writer admires.
    
    One other example, more extended, of a judgmental simile.
    The historian Barbara Tuchman is talking about the attitudes
    of English Socialists just before World War I:
  - |-
    What was needed was a strong [Socialist] party with no nonsense  
    and a businesslike understanding of national needs which would  
    take hold of the future like a governess, slap it into clean clothes,  
    wash its face, blow its nose, make it sit up straight at table and eat  
    a proper diet.
    
    Tuchman's image of the bossy nanny nicely conveys the un-  
    yielding self-righteousness of some Socialists of the period—  
    their smug self-assurance, their certainty that they alone knew  
    what was best for humanity, and their conviction that it was  
    their duty to impose the truth upon people too childish to  
    know what was good for them. Fairly or not, Tuchman is  
    passing judgment. Her mocking image uncovers the disdain  
    for common people which she senses beneath the Socialists'  
    reforming zeal.
    
    The judgments implied by such similes are more than so-  
    ber, objective opinions. The images by which they are deliv-  
    ered give them great persuasive force. Thus Tuchman plays  
    upon the resentment we carry from childhood against those  
    Brobdingnagian know-it-alls who forced us to live by their  
    rules.
    
    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 301
    
    Similes Give Pleasure
    
    All good writing gives pleasure. But figurative language is a  
    special delight. Similes imposing Social-  
    ists who would reform the world to bossy nannies pontifi-  
    cating in a nursery, is amusing (whether it is fair is something  
    else). Here is another example:
    
    There are fanatics who love and venerate spelling as a tomcat loves  
    and venerates catnip. There are grammatomaniacs; schoolmarms  
    who would rather parse than eat; specialists in the objective case  
    that doesn't exist in English; strange beings, otherwise sane and  
    even intelligent and comely, who suffer a split infinitive as  
    you would suffer under gastroenteritis. H. L. Mencken
    
    Similes Intensify Our Awareness
    
    Finally, beyond their capacity to familiarize the strange, to  
    expand ideas, to express feelings and evaluations, and to give  
    us pleasure, similes have an even greater power. They bring  
    us more intimately in touch with reality by joining diverse  
    experiences. Think about this description of an old woman's  
    hands:

    Their touch had no substance, like a dry wind on a July
    afternoon. Sharon Curtin
    
    Curtin's simile does all the usual thisygsfa-compares
    miliar expememee familiar one, implies something
    about the loneliness of old age, even passes a judgment on life.
    But it does more: it unifies perceptions that most of us would
    not have put together.
    
    Similes may also cut across the boundaries that separate the
    senses:
    
    There was a glamour in the air, a something in the special flavour
    of that moment that was like the consciousness of Salvation, or the
    smell of ripe peaches on a sunny wall. Logan Seniiiall
    
    302 DICTION
    
    In that image two disparate sense perceptions blend into a
    uexhedience, and the fused aroma and vision of the
    peaches and the sunlit wall connect with the writer's con-
    sciousness of religious mystery.
    
    Metaphor
    
    Like a simile, a metaphor is also a comparison. The difference
    is that a simile compares things explicitly; it literally says that
    X is like Y. A metaphor compares things implicitly. Read
    literally, it does not state that X is like Y; but rather that X is
    Y:
    
    Cape Cod is the bared and bended arm of Massachusetts.
    Henry David Thoreau
    
    Thoreau writes "is," not "is like." However, we understand
    that he means the Cape resembles a human arm, not that it
    really is an arm. The metaphor has simply taken the compar-
    ison a step closer and expressed it a bit more economically
    and forcefully.'
    
    A metaphor has the same two parts as a simile: tenor—or
    the main subject—and vehicle—the
    comparison. In Sdnorraa'she tenor is "Cape Cod"
    and the vehicle is "the bared and bended arm." In many meta-
    phors both parts are stated. In some, however, the writer re-
    fers only to the vehicle, depending on the context to supply
    the full comparison. Such a figure is called an implied farsed
    mathppohan a full one. Had Thoreau written "the
    bared and bended arm of Massachusetts" in a context which
    clearly indicated he meant Cape Cod, his metaphor would
    have been implied.
  - |-
    1. It is sometimes argued that metaphors are more figurative than similes and even in some ways essentially different. Here we need not assume any greater virtue in metaphors. They are more economical and generally more emphatic. For these reasons they are sometimes preferable to similes. But on some occasions the explicit comparison of a simile is better.
    
    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 303
    
    Fused metaphors may involve metonymy. Metonymy
    means substituting for one concept another that is associated
    with it. The novelist Joseph Conrad, discussing the difficulty
    of saying exactly what one wants to say, speaks of
    
    the old, old words, worn thin, defaced by ages of careless usage.
    
    Conrad does not actually say that words are coins, but he
    implies the full metaphor by the expressions "worn thin" and
    "defaced," qualities of old coins. The logic of the figure runs
    like this:
    
    Words are (like) old coins.
    
    Old coins are often worn thin by passing from hand to hand and
    their faces nearly rubbed away.
    
    Therefore, words can be "worn thin" and "defaced."
    
    Another figure often found in metaphors and closely re-
    lated to metonymy is synecdoche, which is substituting a part
    for the whole, as when a ship is referred to as a "sail." In the
    following passage the religious revivals staged by the evan-
    gelist MieRhe Semple compared (implicitly) to
    an amusement park:
    
    With rare ingenuity, Aimee kept the Ferris wheels and the merry-
    go-round of religion going night and day. Carey McWilliams
    
    The logic goes like this:
    
    Aimee's revivals were (like) an amusement park.
    An amusement park contains Ferris wheels and merry-go-rounds.
    
    Therefore, events at the revivals were (like) Ferris wheels and merry-
    go-rounds.
    
    304 DICTION
  - |-
    Many metaphors use synecdoche and metonymy." Usually  
    a writer wants to introduce as precise an image as possible  
    into the vehicle of a metaphor, thus appealing immediately to  
    the reader's eyes or ears. "Ferris wheels" and "merry-go-  
    rounds," for instance, are easier to visualize than the larger, more abstract "amusement park." And these images are richly  
    meaningful, implying the park in its entirety, as well as evok-  
    ing vivid pictures of revolving vertical and horizontal wheels.
    
    The Uses of Metaphor
    
    Metaphors have the same functions as similes. They clarify  
    the unfamiliar and render abstractions in images:
    
    [Science] pronounces only on whatever, at the time, appears to  
    have been scientifically ascertained, which is a small island in an  
    ateaniente. Bertrand Russel
    
    Russell's image of a small island (science) in a wide and lonely  
    sea (all that we do not know) vividly expresses the relation-  
    ship between knowledge and ignorance.
    
    Metaphors also enrich meaning by implying added dimen-  
    sions of thought or feeling. Consider all that is suggested by  
    the term "idol" in this metaphor:
    
    We squat before television, the idol of our cherished progress.  
    Evelyn Jones
    
    "Idol," signifying a false god, denies the progress television  
    symbolizes and celebrates. The image implies as well the ir-  
    rationality and subservience of its worshipers.
    
    In the next example the judgmental quality of the metaphor
    
    2. Metonymy is sometimes treated as a figure distinct from metaphor. For  
    our purposes it is convenient to regard withabong- synecdoche—as  
    riety of metaphor.
    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 305
    
    is more pronounced. About the ancient Romans, the writer  
    remarks that
    
    they were marked by the thumbprint of an unnatural vulgarity,  
    which they never succeeded in surmounting. Lawrence Durrell
    
    A dirty thumbprint, like one left on a china cup or a white  
    watkepwibati gnature of crudeness. In the following
    
    metaphor the judgment is ironic (the passage concerns Huey  
    Long, a powerful Louisiana politician of the 1930s, who,  
    when he was elected to the U.S. Senate, passed on his gov-  
    ernorship to a political crony):
  - |-
    He designated his old benefactor, M. Allen of Winnfield, as the
    apostolic choice for the next full term. Hodding Carter
    
    "Apostolic," alluding to Christ and his disciples, is a wry
    comment on Long: on the power he wielded, on the venera-
    tion he was accorded by his followers, and perhaps even on
    himself regarded.
    
    Like similes, metaphors may be emotionally charged, pleas-
    antly or, as in this example, unpleasantly (the writer is re-
    membering a dose of castor oil forced down him when he was
    a child):
    
    ... a bulge of colorless slime on a giant spoon. William Gibson
    
    Metaphors are also emphatic, particularly at the end of a
    statement, where the figure and pictureses
    complex abstraction, but also strongly restates it, leaving
    a memorable image in the mind:
    
    What distinguishes a black hole from a planet or an ordinary star
    is that anything falling into it cannot come out of it again. If light
    cannot escape, nothing else can and it is a perfect trap: a turnstile
    to oblivion. Cauer Nigel
    306 DICTION
    
    Finally, metaphors may be extended through several sen-
    tences or even an entire paragraph. In fact, exploring and ex-
    panding a metaphor can be an effective way of generating a
    piece of prose. Here is a brief example:
    
    Man is born broken. He lives by mending. The grace of God is
    glue. Eugene O'Neill
    
    And here are two longer ones. The first is a metaphor comparing Time magazine to a tale told to little children:
    
    It's like a nursery book in which the reader is slapped and
    tickled alternately. It is full of predigested pap spooned out with
    confidential nudges. The reader is never on his own for an instant,
    but, as though at his mother's knee, he is provided with the right
    emotions for everything he hears or sees as the pages turn.
    
    Marshall McLuhan
  - |-
    Notice how the metaphor determines the diction: "slapped and tickled," "predigested pap," "spooned out," "nudges," "never on his own," "mother's knee," "provided with." Even the phrase "as the pages turn" suggests the passivity of a child for whom the baby-sitter turns the pages.
    
    The other example of an extended metaphor returns us to the passage with which we began this section, Thoreau's comparison of Cape Cod to a bent arm. The image opens a paragraph in the book Cape Cod:
    
    Cape Cod is the bared and bended arm of Massachusetts: the shoulder is at Buzzard's Bay; the elbow, or crazy-bone, at Cape Mallow; the wrist at Truro; and the sandy fist at Provincetown—behind which the State stands on her guard, with her back to the Green Mountains, and her feet planted on the floor of the ocean, like an athlete protecting her Bay—rbdkiest storms,
    
    and, ever and anon, heaving up her Atlantic adversary from the lap of the #arthrustefdward her other fist, which keeps
    
    guard the while upon her breast at Cape Ann.
    
    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 307
    
    The figure organizes the entire paragraph, which develops the image of "the bare and bended arm" both by analysis and by expansion. Thoreau breaks it down into its parts—"elbow," "wrist," Aippstiés-eauh of these to Cape Cod. At
    
    the same time he expands the metaphor into the larger inclusive image of the bfeetr'—"bahky' fist," "hxedst''deiolnneating other parts of
    
    Massachusetts.
    
    If you wish to develop a metaphor (or simile), remember that you can work in either of these ways, or even, like Tho-
    reau, in both: inwardly, differentiating the elements of the
    image and relating these to your main topic; or outwardly,
    exploring the larger entity to which the image belongs, as the
    "pared arm" is a natural part of a boxer in a defensive stance.
    
    Finding Metaphors
  - |-
    There is no formula for creating metaphors. Sometimes the
    literal detail of a scene lends itself to figurative use, as in the
    following sentence explaining why the writer was not allowed
    into a large office to observe the regimented life of clerks:
    
    I knew those rooms were back there, but couldn't get past the
    opaque glass doors any more than could get past the opaque glass
    Smiles. Barbara Carson
    
    Another source of metaphor is metonymy, which describes
    something in terms of an associated quality. Here is a sentence
    about the coming of spring in which birdsongs are described
    as if they were, themselves, birds:
    
    The birds have started singing in the valley. Their February squawks
    and naked chirps are fully fledged now, and lprigs fly in the
    air. Annie Dillard
    
    More often, however, a metaphor or simile involves a com-
    parison which, while apt and revealing, does not grow natu-
    rally out of the subject as do the images by Garson and
    
    308 DICTION
    
    Dillard. For instance one philosopher discusses the style of
    another like this:
    
    The style is not, as philosophic style should be, so transparent a
    medium that one looks straight through it at the object, forgetting
    that it is there; it is too much like a window of stained glass which,
    because of its very richness, diverts attention to itself.
    
    Brand Blanshard
    
    But whether a metaphor arises from "inside" the subject
    or from "outside," its coming depends on imagination. There
    is no magic for discovering metaphors. It is a talent, and some
    people are more adept at seeing resemblances than the rest of
    us. Still, we can all profit from letting our minds run free from
    inhibitions. In a first draft don't be frightened of a simile or
    metaphor, even if it sounds far-fetched.
    
    Using Metaphors Effectively
    
    When you revise, however, become more detached and crit-
    ical about figures (as about all phases of your writ-
    ing). To use metaphors and similes effectively, remember
    these principles:
  - |-
    [> Metaphors and Similes Should Be Fresh and Original  
    Avoid trite figures: "quiet as a mouse," "white as a sheet,"  
    "the game of life," "a tower of strength." Clever humorists  
    can make such clichés work for them, but only by playing  
    upon their staleness. If you can think of nothing more original  
    than "his face was white as a sheet," you are better off saying  
    simply, "His face was very white.""
    
    3. As mentioned on pp. 198-99, such trite similes and metaphors may be described as "dying," to distinguish them from figures already dead. Dead metaphors are those that have passed beyond the figure and acquired a new literal sense. They are perfectly  
    legitimate, and you should not feel doubtful about them. Once "mouth of a  
    river" was probably a fresh and vivid image. Today "mouth" in this expres-  
    sion is not felt to be metaphorical at all; it is taken literally to mean the wide-  
    ning of a river as it empties into a larger body of water.  
    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 309  
    
    > The Vehicle Should Fit the Tenor  
    
    The vehicle of any simile or metaphor is likely to have several  
    meanings. Be sure that none of them works against you. It is  
    easy to focus so exclusively on the meaning you want that  
    you overlook others which may spoil the comparison:  
    
    The town hall has been weathered by cold winds and harsh snows  
    like an old mare turned out to graze.  
    
    While an old mare is an image of decrepitude, it has other  
    characteristics which make it unsuitable as a vehicle for a  
    building. Can you imagine a town hall in a pasture, nibbling  
    grass and swatting flies with its tail?  
    
    [> Metaphors and Similes Should Be Appropriate to the  
    Context  
    
    Figures of speech have their own levels of formality and in-  
    formality. Even when it does not possess a specifically  
    ward connotations, a simile or metaphor must not be too col-  
    loquial or too learned for the occasion. It would not do to  
    write in a paper for a history professor that "Napoleon went  
    through Russia like a dose of salts."
  - |-
    Metaphors and Similes Should Not Be Awkwardly Mixed
    
    When several similes or metaphors appear in the same passage, they ought to harmonize in thought and image. Mixtures like the following are awkward at best and silly at worst:
    
    The moon, a silver coin hung in the draperies of the enchanted night, fled her glance, which gilded the rooftops with a joyful phosphorescence.
    
    This sounds oppressive—tantalizing about the picture it so lushly describes. If the moon is a "coin" how can "she" "let fall [a] glance"? How can "silver" be used for gilding, which means to cover with gold? Why mix the three elements of silver, gold, and phosphorus? Can "phosphorescence" be "joyful"? Do "coins" hang in "draperies"?
    
    Even dead metaphors and similes must be mixed carefully. Although such expressions no longer have figurative value, they can bring each other embarrassingly to life. The dead metaphors, "mouth of a river" and "leg of a journey," for instance, work well enough alone, but it would be clumsy to write that "the last leg of our journey began at the mouth of the river."
    
    You must be careful, too, about the other, nonfigurative words you use with a simile or metaphor, even when these words are to be read literally. Because this writer was careless with his contextual diction, his metaphor fails:
    
    The teacher leaves the students to develop the foundations of their education.
    
    "Foundations," of course, are "built" or "laid," not "developed."
    
    > Metaphors and Similes Should Not Be Overworked
    
    Metaphors and similes ought not to be sprinkled about profusely, especially in expository writing. Even when they do not clash, too many are likely to cancel one another. Their rarity is their being relatively uncommon, for
    
    if every other sentence contains a simile or a metaphor, readers soon begin to discount them.

    Personification, really a special kind of metaphor, is referring
    to inanimate things or to abstractions as if they were human.
    A simple instance of personification is the use of personal
    pronouns to refer to objects, as when sailors speak of a ship
    as "she." Here is a more subtle instance, a description of the
    social changes in an area of London:
    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 311
    
    As London increased, however, rank and fashion rolled off to the
    west, and trade, creeping on at their heels, took possession of their
    deserted abodes. Washington Irving
    
    "Rank" and "fashion" signify aristocratic Londoners;
    "trade" designates the merchant class. These abstractions are
    personified by the verbs: the aristocrats "roll off" elegantly
    in carriages, the tradesmen "creep" in with the deference of
    self-conscious inferiors.
    
    The purpose of personification is to explain, expand, vivify:
    
    There is a rowdy strain in American life, living close to the surface
    but running very deep. Like an ape behind a mask it can display
    itself suddenly with terrifying effect. It is slack-jawed, with leering
    eyes and loose wet lips, with heavy feet and ponderous cunning
    hands; now and then when something tickles it, it guffaws, and
    when it is angry it snarls; and it can be aroused more easily than
    it can be quieted. Mike Fink and Yankee Doodle helped to father
    it, and Judge Lynch is one of its creations; and when it comes lum-
    bering forth it can make the whole country step in time to its own
    irregular pulse beat. Bruce Catton
    
    Personification (or perhaps "animalification")
    
    makes his point with extraordinary clarity and strength:
    mindless savagery is no abstraction; it is an ever-present
    menace.
    
    Allusions
    
    An allusion is a brief reference to a well-known person, place,
    or happening. Sometimes the reference is explicitly identified:
    
    As it is, he is like that man in The Pilgrim's Progress, by some ac-
    counted man, who the more he cast away the more he had.
    W. Hudson

    More often the reference is indirect, and the writer depends
    on the reader's recognizing the source and significance:
    
    We [Western peoples] tend to have a Micawberish attitude toward
    life, a feeling that so long as we do not get too excited something
    is certain torn up. Barbara Ward
    
    A writer making an allusion should be reasonably sure that it
    will be familiar. Barbara Ward, for instance, could fairly refer
    to Mr. Micawber, confident that her readers know Dickens's
    David Copperfield to remember Mr. Micawber,
    burdened by family and debt, yet cheerfully optimistic that
    some lucky chance will rescue him from ruin.
    
    Some allusions are not to persons, but to well known passages—from the Bible, say, or a line from Shakespeare.
    The passage may be paraphrased or quoted literally, although
    it is not usually enclosed in quotation marks. There is no
    question of plagiarizing; the writer assumes readers know
    what he or she is doing. In this sentence, for instance, the
    allusion is to the Old Testament book of Ecclesiastes (3:1-8):
    
    I didn't know whether should appear before is yotirmdhere
    to show and a time to hide; there is a time to speak, and also a
    time to be silent. Norman Brown
    
    While many allusions are from literature, some refer
    to historical events or people, ancient or more recent:
    
    These galactic monstrous states, are not natural beings.
    . . . [Moloch was an ancient Semitic deity to whom children were
    sacrificed. ] Suzanne K. Langer
    
    And it is not opinions or thoughts that Time provides its readers as
    news comment. Rather, the newsreel is provided with a razzle-
    dazzle accompaniment of Spike Jones noises. [Spike Jones was a
    popular orchestra leader of the 1940s for wacky, comic
    arrangements of light classics and pop tunes. He used automobile
    horns, cow bells, steam whistles, and so on.]* Marshall McLuhan
  - |-
    Whatever the source of an allusion, its purpose is to enrich
    meaning by packing into a few words a complex set of ideas
    or feelings. Think, for instance, of how much is implied by
    describing a politician's career as "Napoleonic," or an acci-
    dent as being "Titanic."
    
    But remember that to work at all, allusions must be (1)
    appropriate to your point and (2) within the experience of
    your readers.
    
    Irony
    
    Irony consists of using words in a sense very different from
    their usual meaning. The simplest case occurs when a term is
    given its opposite value. Here, for example, a historian de-
    scribes a party at the court of the English king James I:
    
    Later the company flocked to the windows to look into the palace
    courtyard below. Here a vast company had already assembled to
    watch the King's bears fight with greyhounds, and mastiffs bait a
    tethered bull. These delights were succeeded by tumblers on tight-
    ropes and displays of horsemanship. c. p. v. Akrigg
    
    By "delights" we are expected to understand "abominations," "detestable acts of cruelty."
    
    In subtler form, irony plays more lightly over words, per-
    vading an entire passage rather than twisting any single word
    into its opposite. An instance occurs in this sentence (the
    writer is commenting on the decline of the medieval ideal of
    the knight):
    
    4. The fact that it is necessary to explain who Spike Jones was indicates that
    allusions to contemporary people and events may quickly become dated.
    314 DICTION
    
    In our end of time the chevalier has become a Knight of Pythias,
    or Columbus, or the Temple, who solemnly girds on sword and
    armor past his own drugstore. Monis Bishop
    
    None of Bishop's words means its reverse; the sentence is
    to be read literally. Still, Bishop intends us to smile at con-
    temporary men playing at knighthood. The irony lies in the
    fact that some of the words ought not to be taken literally.
    Twentieth-century businessmen ought not to "solemnly gird
    on sword and armor," blithely unaware of the disparity be-
    tween knightly ideals and modern life.
  - |-
    Disparity is the common denominator in both these examples of irony: the difference between the ideal and the actual, between what we profess and what we do, between what we expect and what we get. In stressing such disparities, irony is fundamentally different from simile and metaphor, which build upon similarity. The whole point of irony is that things are not what they seem or what they should be or what we want them to be. They are different.
    
    Irony reveals the differences in various ways. One is by using words in a double sense, making them signify both the ideal and the actual ("delights"). Another is by juxtaposing images of what could be (or once was) and of what is (the chevalier girding on his sword and the neighborhood drug-gist). Either way, we are made conscious of the gap between "ought" and "is": people ought to treat dumb animals kindly; they do take pleasure in torturing them.
    
    The writer employing irony must be sure that his or her readers will understand the special value of the words. Sometimes one can depend on the general knowledge and attitudes of the audience. The ironic sense of Akrigg's "delights" is clear because modern readers know that such amusements are not delightful.
    
    But sometimes irony must be signaled, as in this passage by the historian Barbara Tuchman (she is discussing the guilt of the Nazi leaders):
    
    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 315
    
    When it comes to guilt, a respected writer—respectable
    middle-aged man—has given his considered verdict on the Nazi program,
    that evil is commonplace—that means something so ordinary that
    you are not bothered by it; the dictionary definition is "commonplace and hackneyed." Somehow that conclusion does not seem adequate or even apt. Of course, evil is commonplace; of course we all partake of it. Does that mean that we must withhold disapproval, and that when evil appears in dangerous degree or vicious form we must not condemn but only understand?
  - |-
    The specifically ironic words are "respected" and "considered verdict." The first is cued by the qualification "respected in some circles," with its barbed insinuation: "respected, but not by you or me." "Considered verdict" is pushed into irony not so much by any particular cue as by the total context. If "banality" is the only judgment the other writer can make, her jualgityenter{Huchmith suggests—is
    ering. "Verdict" has another ironic overtone. The word
    signifies a judicial decision, and Tuchman implies that her
    Opponent is presumptuous in delivering a verdict as if she
    were judge and jury.
    
    In other ways, too, Tuchman reveals her feelings and thus
    contributes to the tone of irony. The repetition of the itali-
    cized "of course" implies the commonplaceness of the ideas.
    And the rhetorical question, stressing the undeniable truth of
    Tuchman's point, underscores the folly she is attacking.
    
    Irony may be used in a variety of tones. Some irony is
    genial, amusing and amused, like that by Morris Bishop. Some
    is more serious (Akrigg) or even angry (Tuchman). But what-
    ever its tone, irony contributes significantly to a writer's per-
    sona. It is a form of aombtante-fenougthus
    it represents an intrusion of the writer into the writing. He
    or she stands forth, moreover, in a special way: as a subtle,
    complex, witty presence, deliberately using intellect to dis-
    tance emotion. This does not mean that irony diminishes
    emotion. On the contrary: irony acts like a lens, concentrating
    the emotions focused through it. But it does mean that irony
    constrains emotion rather than allowing it to gush.
  - |-
    Irony, finally, may function in prose in two ways: (1) as a
    specific figure of speech, a device for expressing a particular
    judgment; or (2) as a mode of thought, an encompassing vi-
    sion of people and events. In this broad aspect irony is the
    stance some writers take toward life. They alone may prop-
    erly be described as ironists. The rest of us, though we are
    not ironists in this deeper sense, can profitably use irony now
    and then.
    
    Overstatement and Understatement
    
    Overstatement and understatement are special kinds of irony.
    Each depends on the disparity between the reality the writer
    describes and the words he or she uses. Overstatement ex-
    aggerates the subject, magnifying it beyond its true dimen-
    sions. Understatement takes the opposite tack: the words are
    intentionally inadequate to the reality.
    
    Overstatement
    
    The rhetorical name for overstatement is hyperbole, from a
    Greek word meaning "excess." Loosely speaking, there are
    two kinds of overstatement: comic and serious. Like carica-
    ture, comic hyperbole ridicules or burlesques by enlargement.
    Comic overstatement has deep roots in American literature.
    It is a major element in the tales told by such folk heroes
    as Mike Fink, Brey Crockett. Much of Mark Twain's
    humor depends on overstatement. Here, for instance, is a pas-
    sage from his essay "The Awful German Language," included
    in A Tramp Abroad:
    
    An average sentence in a German newspaper, is a sublime and
    impressive curiosity; @ccupies a quarter of a column; it contains
    all the ten parts of seecjulamortder, but mixed; it is
    
    built mainly of compound words constructed by the writer on the

    in a parenthesis of its own, with here and there extra parentheses
    which reinclose three or four ofthe minor parentheses, making pens
    within pens: finally, all the parentheses and reparentheses are
    massed together between a couple of king-parentheses, one of
    which is placed in the first line of the majestic sentence and the
    other in the middle of the last line of #halfteromes the

    far as tan make woter-sthevels in "habensind gewesen

    ument is finished.
    
    Serious overstatement differs only in its end, which is per-
    suasion rather than laughter. The writer may wish to impress
    us with the value of something or to shock us into seeing a
    hard truth. Shock is the tactic of H. L. Mencken, who cudgels
    what he regarded as the venality, stupidity, and smugness of
    life in the 1920s:
    
    It is ... one of my firmest and most sacred beliefs, reached after an
    enquiry extending over a score of years and supported by incessant
    prayer and meditation, that the government of the United States, in
    both its legislative arm and its executive arm, is ignorant, incom-

    no more than twenty living lawmakers and no more than twenty

    timorous, sniveling, poltroonish, ignominious mob of serfs and
    goose-steppers ever gathered under one flagchristendom since
    
    the end of the Middle Ages, and that they grow more timorous,
    more sniveling, more poltroonish, more ignominious every day.
    
    Comic or serious, overstatement relies on several devices.
    It likes the superlative forms of adjectives, the hugest num-
    bers, the longest spans of time, extremes of all sorts. It prefers
    sweeping generalizations: every, all, always, never, none. It
    admits few qualifications or disclaimers, and if it does qualify,
    it may turn the concession into another exaggerated claim
    (like Mencken's "and from this judgment I except no more
    than twenty living lawmakers"). It rides upon words with
    strong emotional connotations like "sniveling," "poltroon-
    ish," "ignominious," "knavish." Its sentence structure is
    likely to be emphatic, with strong rhythms and frequent rep-
    etitions. Short statements are stressed by being set beside
    longer ones.
    
    In the hands of writers like Twain or Mencken, over-
    statement is powerful rhetoric, shocking, infuriating, hilari-
    ous. But this very power is a limitation. Overstatement is hard
    to take for very long and quickly loses its capacity to shock
    or amuse. Even worse, overstatement like Mencken's is often
    abused. It is, after all, assertion, not reasoned argument, and
    it easily degenerates into shrill name-calling.
    
    Understatement
    
    Understatement stresses importance by seeming to deny it.
    Like overstatement it can be comic or serious. Twain is being
    funny in this passage:
    
    I have been strictly reared, but if it had not been so dark and solemn
    and awful there in that vast, lonely room, do believe should have
    said something which could not be put into a Sunday-school book
    without injuring the sale of it.
    
    But here is a more serious case:
    FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 319
  - |-
    Last week $aw a woman flayed alive, and you will hardly believe  
    how it altered her appearance for the worse. Jonathan Swift  
    
    Understatement works a paradox: increasing emotional im-  
    pact by carefully avoiding emotive language. It is a species of  
    irony in that the deeper value of the words differs from their  
    surface meaning. Swift's phrase "altered her appearance for  
    the worse" seems woefully inadequate: no streaming blood,  
    no frenzied screams, no raw, quivering fhesth"just  
    altered her appearance for the worse." But Swift tricks us into  
    imagining the scene for ourselves, and this makes the brutality  
    real.  
    
    In the following paragraph Ernest Hemingway increases  
    horror by denying the horrible, writing as if a cold-blooded  
    execution were just routine. Which in time of war it is; and  
    that's the horror.  
    
    They shot the cabinet ministers at half-past six in the morning  
    against the wathe hospital. There were pools of water in the  
    courtyard. There were wet dead leaves on the paving of the court-  
    yard. It rained hard. All the shutters of the hospital were nailed shut.  
    One of the ministers was sick with typhoid. Two soldiers carried  
    him downstairs and out into the rain. They tried to hold him up  
    against the wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. The other  
    five stood very quietly against the wall. Finally the officer told the  
    soldiers it was no good trying to make him stand up. When they  
    fired the first volley he was sitting down in the water with his head  
    on his knees.  
    
    Sometimes words are unequal to reality. Then understate-  
    ment may be the best strategy, rendering the event in simple,  
    direct language:  
    
    In the heart of the city near the buildings of the Prefectural Gov-  
    ernment and at the intersection of the busiest streets, everybody  
    had stopped and stood in a crowd gazing up at three parachutes  
    floating down through the blue air.  
    
    The bomb exploded several hundred feet above their heads.
  - |-
    A special form of understatement is *itotes, a term sometimes used as a synonym for understatement in general. More narrowly it means emphasizing a positive by doubling a negative as when we express admiration for a difficult tennis player by exclaiming, "Not bad," or stress someone's bravery by saying that he "did not play the coward."
    
    Whatever we call it, understatement is a powerful figure of speech. To naive readers it sometimes seems callous or insensitive: some of Swift's contemporaries, for example, thought his irony to be mere cruelty. But when it really connects with subject and reader, understatement is more explosive than hyperbole.
    
    Puns
    
    A pun is a word employed in two or more senses, or a word used in a context that suggests a second term sounding like it. In either case the two meanings must interact, usually, though not necessarily, in a humorous way. In the first of the two following examples, the pun depends on different senses of the same word; in the second, on one word's sounding like another:
    
    A cannon-ball took off his legs, so he laid down his arms.
    Thomas Hood
    
    During the two previous centuries musical styles went in one era and out the other... . Frank Muir
    
    While puns resemble irony in simultaneously using words in different senses, they differ in important ways. For one thing, a pun is today almost exclusively a device of humor (though in earlier centuries poets and dramatists often em-
    ployed puns for serious meanings). Here, for instance, Mark Twain makes a joke by punning on the expression "raising chickens":
    
    Even as a schoolboy poultry-raising was a study with me, and I may say without egotism that as early as the age of seventeen was acquainted with all the best and speediest methods of raising chickens, from raising them off a roost by burning Lucifer matches under their noses, down to lifting them off a fence on a frosty night by insinuating a warm board under their feet.
  - |-
    For another thing, puns reveal unexpected connections. In  
    this they are less like irony than like simile and metaphor. A  
    good pun not only amuses us, but also points to unrealized  
    similarities. The humorist S.J. Perelman entitles one collec-  
    tion of essays The Road to filtowsny the Spreading  
    Atrophy (Miltown was the brand name of a popular tran-  
    quilizer.) Punning on "a tree," the word "atrophy" echoes a  
    famous phrase of sentimental poetry, "under the spreading  
    chestnut tree"; and the participle "spreading" acquires a sin-  
    ister implication, far removed from the pleasant connotations  
    it has in Longfellow's poem, "The Village Blacksmith." In an  
    age given to the wholesale swallowing of tranquilizers, atro-  
    phy may indeed be spreading.
    
    Because they became a sign of "low" humor in the late  
    nineteenth century, many people consider puns unseemly in  
    anything but avowedly humorous writing. That judgment is  
    a bit harsh. A bad pun is regrettable. But a good pun—one  
    both clever and vevedlingakisg.
    
    Zeugma
    
    Zeugma (pronounced ZOOG-ma) is a special kind of pun  
    involving a verb used with two or more objects, but with a  
    difference of meaning. Here the novelist Lawrence Durrell is  
    describing the plight of a maiden chased by lustful monks:
      
    Joanna, pursued by the three monks, ran about the room, leaping  
    over tables and chairs, sometimes throwing a dish or a scriptural  
    maxim at her pursuers.
    
    And here is a wry d&fimiann:
    
    Piane,parlor utensil for subduing the impenitent visitor. It is  
    operated by depressing the keys of the machine and the spirits of  
    the audience. Ambrose Bierce
    
    Zeugma, like puns generally, is a comic figure of speech. It  
    is witty and amusing, and increases meaning by linking dis-  
    parities: Pwirellisf dishes and scriptural maxims re-  
    veals their equal inefficacy in Joanna's plight.
    
    Imagery
  - |-
    An image is a word or expression that speaks directly to one  
    or more of the senses, as in this description of the Seine in  
    Paris:
    
    The river was brown and green—live-green bridges—  
    and a rainbow-coloured scum floated at the sides. Rrys Jean
    
    Images are classified according to the sense to which they  
    primarily appeal. Visual images, like those in the sentence  
    above, are the most common. Next in frequency, probably,  
    are auditory images, directed to the ear:
    
    The [medieval] house lacked air, light, and comfort modern;  
    people had little taste for privacy. They lived most of their lives on  
    the streets, noisy indeed by day, with pounding hammers, scream-  
    ing saws, clattering wooden shoes, street cries of vendors of goods  
    and services, and the hand bells of pietists, summoning all to pray  
    for the soukseefi. Morris Bishop
    
    Images can appeal to other senses: to smell, taste, touch,  
    even to the muscular sense of movement and balance (these  
    are called kinesthetic images). Here, for example, is an in-  
    dictment of the odors of a modern city:
    
    ... [T]he reek of gasoline exhaust, the sour smell of a subway  
    crowd, the pervasive odor of a garbage dump, the sulphurous fumes  
    of a chemical works, the carbolated rankness of a public lavatory  
    ... the chlorinated exudation of ordinary drinking water. ...
    
    Lewis Mumford
    
    Often an image stimulates two or more senses simultane-  
    ously, though it is directed primarily to one. Thus in Rhys's  
    sentence about the Seine, the imagery, while essentially visual,  
    also suggests the feel of the water and the smell of the scum.
    
    At their simplest, images re-create sensory experience.  
    Bishop makes us "hear" a medieval city. In the following  
    passage the writer "images" the experience of walking in a  
    small stream:
    
    Exploring a streambed can be done on a purely sensual level. How  
    it all feels—soft, mossy mud under feet; cold fast mountain

    water or the touch of a sun-warmed gentle brook; water wrapping
    itself around your ankles or knees, swirling in little eddies, sparkling
    in small pools, rushing away white and foamy over rapids, or
    calmly meandering over glistening pebbles. Ruth Rucner
    
    Rasduepison also shows how images may be mixed
    to appeal to several senses. Many of her words are tactile:
    "soft mud under feet," "the touch of a sun-warmed gentle
    brook," "water wrapping itself around your ankles or knees."
    Others are visual: "moss, wet rock," "swirling in little ed-
    dies," "sparkling," "glistening pebbles." Still others, kines-
    thetic: "swirling" again, "rushing away," "calmly
    meandering."
    
    But images can be stretched to signify more than sensual
    experience. Here, for instance, is a description of a California
    landscape, scene of a murderous love affair:
    
    324 DICTION
    
    The lemon groves are sunken, down a three- or four-foot retaining
    wall, so that one looks directly into their foliage, too lush, too un-
    settlingly glossy, the greenery of nightmare; the fallen eucalyptus
    bark is too dusty, a place for snakes to breed. Joan Didion
    
    Literally these images describe the trees and the bark-
    strewn ground. Yet they suggest unnaturalness and evil too,
    a morbid aura of death. We cannot say that they "mean" evil
    and death, as we may say that the vehicle of a metaphor sig-
    nifies something for which it stands. Nonetheless the images
    have overtones that give the passage a sinister vibrato.
    
    At times this sort of implication is carried so far that an
    image acquires symbolic value, rendering a complex, abstract
    idea in a sharp perception. At the end of the following sen-
    tence the novelist and essayist George Orwell turns an image
    into a symbol of judgment:

    Any, free peoples of the world, stand shoulder to shoulder—one

    stronger when the light catches the speaker's spectacles and turns  
    them into blank discs which seem to have no eyes behind them.  
    
    CHAPTER
    
    Unusual Words and  
    Collocations  
    
    Diction does not have to be frguatthveur eye. Even  
    
    literal language is memorable when it is unusual, whether in  
    the form of uncommon words or of everyday ones used in  
    odd senses or in striking collocations.  
    
    A collocation is a group of words considered as a unit of  
    meaning. For example, in the sentence "Ambitious people  
    seek a place in the sun" the phrase "a place in the sun" is a  
    collocation, a conventional and predictable one in that con-  
    text. In "Wise people seek a place in the shadows" the phrase  
    "in the shadows" is, for the context, less usual, more surpris-  
    ing. Like a good simile or metaphor, an unpredictable word  
    or combination of wénedh—effectively used—conveys  
    idea or feeling or perception. It stretches our minds to accom-  
    modate something new.  
    
    Urging the value of uncommon words may seem to con-  
    tradict the principle of simplicity. Actually it only qualifies  
    that principle. Simplicity of diction does not mean simple-  
    mindedness. It means that diction ought to be no more dif-  
    ficult than the writer's purpose requires. And sometimes only  
    an uncommon word or collocation will serve the purpose of  
    expressing a thought or of stimulating the reader.  
    
    326 DICTION  
    
    Unusual Words  
    
    Often a striking word comes from a foreign language or is an  
    antiquated English word:  
    
    "The average autochthonous Irishman is close to patriotism because  
    he is close to the earth." c. Khesterton  
    
    "For when the Commodore roused his starboard watch at 5:14—  
    having given them an hour and a quarter as tagniappe-—there  
    a good feeling of having turned a corner unaware...."  
    
    Christopher Morley  
    
    "We stood there mumchance and swallowing, wondering what the  
    devil this Construction was." Lawrence Durrell

    Unusual words ought not to be used just because they are
    unusual, but because they are also precise and economic. Auto-
    morphism a native, one born in a
    
    particular region—country—soots meaning,
    
    loosely, "the land itself." Thus the word is not simply a fancy
    equivalent to native; it stresses Chesterton's point that patri-
    otism is rooted in soil. Lagniappe, common in Louisiana
    though not elsewhere, is borrowed from American Spanish
    and means something extra thrown in for goodwill, like the
    thirteenth roll in a baker's dozen; it has here the advantage of
    concision, of saying in a single word what otherwise would
    require a phrase of three or four terms. Mumchance, an older
    English word seldom heard today, means "silently," and im-
    plies a shocked, stunned silence.
    
    Sometimes an unusual word is not foreign or archaic, but
    technical, made striking by being applied outside its normal
    context, like the business terms in this sentence by Rudyard
    Kipling:
    
    Very minute are the instructions of the Government for the disposal,
    wharfage, and demurrage of its dead.
    
    UNUSUAL WORDS AND COLLOCATIONS 327
    
    Here again we see that the unusual words are exactly right.
    Kipling implies the callousness of the British government to-
    ward those who died in its service in India: their coffins
    merchandise, and the charges for loading and storage are care-
    fully calculated.
    
    Unusual Meanings
    
    Uncommonness may reside not so much in the rarity of the
    word itself, as in the meaning it carries. A writer may evoke
    an older meaning, closer to the etymological sense. Robert
    Frost, writing about the United States, speaks of the "land
    realizing itself westward." We think of realize as meaning "to
    understand clearly," and we must pause a moment to grasp
    that Frost calls up the older sense of "to make real": the na-
    tion created its reality as it drove westward. And in the fol-
    lowing sentence imagination does not have its common
    meaning of "creative faculty," but rather signifies the pro-
    ductions of that creativity:
    
    Universities flourished; scholars wrote their profundities and nov-
    elists their imaginations. Moris Bishop
  - |-
    Everyday words may also be made striking by being shifted out of their usual grammatical roles. Here a writer describing the coming of spring employs "indestructible" as a noun:
    
    Under the spruce boughs which overlay the borders, the first shoots of snowdrops appeared, the indestructible. E. B. White
    
    Neologisms
    
    Neologisms constitute a special class of rare words. Literally "new words," they are made up by the writer. Some are new in being original combinations of phonemes (that is, sounds). James Thurber invents several such neologisms to describe the family car being hit by a trolley:
    
    Tires booped and whoosed, the fenders qudetedked, the
    steering wheel rose up like a spectre and disappeared in the direc-
    tion of Franklin Avenue with a melancholy whistling sound, bolts
    and gadgets flew like sparks from a Catherine wheel.
    
    Thurber's coinages are onomatopoeic (imitating sound). In the
    next example the neologism is formed by adding a suffix
    which does not conventionally go with the word (and in the
    process making a pun):
    
    But once there came to "the grey metropolis" a Finnish lady—a
    most perfect representative of non-Aryan beauty and anythingarian
    chaom--td only men, but what is more wonderful, most
    
    women, fell captive the moment they saw her. George Saintsbury
    
    But probably most neologisms are novel compound words.
    Barbara Tuchman describes the most remarkable quality of a
    particular statesman as his tybatbevdamnedness'';
    eler in Sicily complains of the crude duckboards placed for
    tourists around an excavation of beautiful mosaics:
    
    It was a groan-making thing to do and only an archeologist could
    have thought of it. Lawrence Durrell
  - |-
    Such constructions are called nonce compounds, which are distinct from the conventional compounds we all use, like teenager or schoolboy. Nonce compounds are usually hyphenated, unlike conventional compounds, some of which are hyphenated and some written as one unit. Occasionally a nonce compound consists of a number of words strung together in a phrase acting as a single grammatical part (usually a modifier) like the ten-word adjectival in this sentence (it modifies a three-word noun):
    
    I doubt whether even the breathless, gosh-gee-whiz-can-all-this-be-happening-to-me TV-celebrity-author could cap this shlock classic wait other. Pauline Kael
    
    UNUSUAL WORDS AND COLLOCATIONS 329
    
    Unusual Collocations
    
    An unusual collocation is an unlikely combination of words, each commonplace in itself but rarely used with the other(s). This description of a midwestern steel plant is an example:
    
    Republic Steel stood abrupt out of the flat prairie. Howard Fast
    
    We do not think of buildings as "standing abrupt," but for that very reason the diction is memorable, like the structures it describes rearing dominantly out of the flat land. Here are several other instances:
    
    ... the cracklin®ylea Thomas
    
    The clammy hauteur of President Hoover.. ..
    Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.
    
    Under the trees, along the cemented paths go drifts of girls, sym-
    pathetic and charming. . .. William Golding
    
    Any grammatical nexus may be made unusual; a subject and verb, for instance:
    
    But her smile was the coup de grace and her sigh buried him
    deep. W. Somerset Maugham
    
    Or a verb and complement:
    
    He smiles his disappointments and laughs his angers.
    E. E. Cummings
    
    Unusual Verbs
    
    Verbs are a fertile source of implied meanings when joined
    with unlikely subjects or objects:
    
    But the weeks blurred by and he did not leave. Egy Willard R.
    330 DICTION
    
    . No &itdsiangd the silence. sunflecked Joan Lindsey
    
    Often an unusual verb implies a comment:
    
    The more we prattle about morality, the more the world shows us
    how complicated things really are. Samud c. Floman
  - |-
    The cops squealed with excitement. Howard Fast
    
    ..and then the hideous mannequins galumphed with squeaky
    sBoeStage. Nancy Mitford
    
    Each of those verbs carries adverse connotations. "Prattle"
    suggests childishness; "squealed," a piglike quality; "gal-
    umph," comic awkwardness. And each enriches its passage,
    implying considerably more than it literally states.
    
    Unusual Adjectives
    
    Many other striking collocations involve a modifier (typically
    an adjective) and its headword, as in Dylan Thomas's "the
    crackling sea." One variety of such adjectives is known as a
    transferred eporketassomarily applied to a partic-
    
    ular noun or class of nouns which is used instead to modify
    something associated with that noun, as in "a boiling kettle."
    Here is a more original example:
    
    He would sit upstairs in his angry overalls, too angry to come down
    tduncheon. Harold Nicholson
    
    Oxymoron and Rhetorical Paradox
    
    When the oddity of a collocation becomes seemingly contra-
    dictory, it is called an oxymoron. A famous instance is John
    Milton's description of hell as "darkness visible." In an ox-
    ymoron the modifier appears to contradict its headword:
    "How," we wonder, "can ‘darkness' be Savdpht'?"'
    
    other examples:
    
    UNUSUAL WORDS AND COLLOCATIONS 331
    
    . a practical mystic. ... Lod Roseberry
    .. . delicious diligent indolence. . . . John Keais
    A yawn may be defined as a silent yell. c. K. Chesterton
    
    A rhetorical paradox is an oxymoron writ large. (An oxy-
    moron, in fact, has been defined as a "condensed paradox.")
    It too expresses an apparent contradiction, and differs only in
    being longer and in not condensing the contradiction into a
    headword and modifier:
    
    His soul will never starve for exploits or excitement who is wise
    enough to be made a fool of. c. K. Chesterton
    
    Oxymoron and rhetorical paradox must not be confused
    with the logical paradox, which asserts that something is si-
    multaneously both true and not true, thus violating what lo-
    gicians call the law of noncontradiction. A classic example is:
  - |-
    "The following text has been OCR'd from a PDF. Due to this the text may be formatted incorrectly or mispelled. If there are code examples they may also be formatted incorrectly. Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.
    
    "All Cretans are liars," said a Cretan.
    
    A rhetorical paradox, on the other hand, does not contain a
    true contradiction. It may seem to. Chesterton appears to be
    saying something that is logically pasakboxical—can
    consist of being made a fool of? But the appearance vanishes
    when we understand that Chesterton is using "wise" and
    "fool" in special, though not unique, senses. By "wise" he
    means simple and pure in spirit, unworldly and good. By
    "fool," he means a trusting innocent, rather than a self-
    deluded egotist, the word's usual sense.
    
    Another kind of rhetorical paradox is less an apparent self-
    contradiction than an actual contradiction of a commonly ac-
    cepted belief:
    
    Baseball is an interminable game played by overgrown boys who
    have nothing better to do for the amusement of loafers who have
    nothing to do at all.
    332 DICTION
    
    That unlikely sentence contains no inner contradiction, ap-
    parent or real, but it violently disagrees with conventional
    attitudes.
    
    Paradoxes of this sort may take the form of standing a cli-
    che or popular maxim on its head. Someone remarked, for
    instance, that the German General Staff "has a genius for
    snatching defeat from the jaws of victory." Oscar Wilde
    mocked Victorian morality by reversing the smug judgment
    that "drink is the curse of the working class"; he put it that
    
    . . work is the curse of the drinking class.
    
    Oxymoron and rhetorical paradox, éamlbe, espe-
    cially effective, if they grow naturally out of the subject and
    reveal an important truth about it.
    
    Accumulation, or Piling Up
    
    Accumulation, as we use it here, means stringing together a
    number of words, all the same part of speech and grammatically parallel, that is, connected to the same thing. Most commonly the words are a series of verbs serving the same subject or of adjectives attached to the same headword:
    
    They glittered and shone and sparkled, they strutted, and puffed,
    and posed. Beverley Nichols"

    in a musical idiom that is distinctly American?
    
    John A. Osmundsen
    
    The unusualness of such diction lies not in unconventional or
    paradoxical combinations but in sheer quantity, and of
    course, in quality.
    
    Mixed Levels of Usage
    
    Level of usage means the degree of formality or of informality
    associated with a word. Some words have a limited range of
    appropriateness. They are suitable, say, for formal but not
    informal occasions (pedagogue). Contrarily, another word is
    at home in a colloquial atmosphere but not in a formal one
    (prof). But of course most words are always acceptable
    (teacher), and are not limited by usage restrictions.
    
    It is possible to achieve unusual diction by mixing words
    from different usage levels so that learned literary terms rub
    elbows with colloquialisms and slang:

    James Oliver Robertson  
    334 DICTION  
    
    The line between formal and informal styles is not now  
    held so inflexibly as it used to be. Many writers mix literary  
    and colloquial diction with a freedom that would have been  
    frowned upon a generation or two back. This freedom is wel-  
    come. But it poses its own problems. The mix must work. It  
    cannot be an artificial forcing of an occasional bit of slang to  
    relieve relatively formal prose, or shouldering in a big word  
    here and there to decorate a colloquial style. Words should  
    always be chosen primarily because they say exactly what you  
    want to say.  
    
    When the mix does work, a writer achieves not only pre-  
    cision but a variegated "speech" interesting in itself. Listen,  
    for example, to this discussion of contemporary detective  
    fiction:  
    
    The moral fabric of any age, of any society, is a tapestry in which  
    there are strikingly different and even antithetical motifs. Our pop-  
    ular art forms show that the prevailing fashion in heroes runs to the  
    extroverted he-man, the tough guy who saves the world with a  
    terrific sock on the jaw of the transgressors, and the bang, bang of  
    his pistol. But even this generation, so much exposed to philoso-  
    phies of power, has its hankering for the light that comes from  
    within; and in its folklore there appears, intermittently, a new kind  
    of psiesitdvatalysthe Charles J. Rolo
  - |-
    Rolo's language is generally literary (that is, belonging to formal, written prose): "moral fabric," "antithetical motifs," "transgressors," "philosophies of power," "intermittently," "priest-hero," "psychoanalyst." At the same time he works in colloquialisms: "he-man," "tough guy," "terrific sock on the jaw," "hankering." The diction is unpredictable. It sur-
    prises and thereby pleases us.
    
    But the mix achieves surprise and novelty without sacrificing exactness or economy. Indeed both the literary and the colloquial terms are justifiable for their precision. "Priest-
    hero," for example, sets the detective story into the wider framework of literature and folktale. "He-man" nicely suits the flavor of the tough private-eye fiction Rolo is discussing.
    
    UNUSUAL WORDS AND COLLOCATIONS 335
    
    It is possible to play off formal and colloquial language even more strikingly. In the following passage the journalist A. J. Liebling is describing fight fans, specifically those rooting for the other guy:
    
    Such people may take it upon themselves to disparage the principal
    you are advising. This disparagement is less generally addressed to
    the man himself (as /@idvélanjthan to hisbapwd}
    
    nent, whom they have wrongheadedly picked to win.
    
    Liebling comically contrasts the deliberately inflated diction
    describing the fans' behavior ("disparage the principal you are
    advising") and the language they actually use ("Gavilan, you're a bum!"').
    
    CHAPTER 9
    
    Improving Your Vocabulary:
    Dictionaries
    
    Vocabulary is best extended by reading and writing. Memorizing lists of words has dubious value. The words are abstracted from any context, so that while you may learn the
    denotation you acquire little feeling for connotation and level of usage. Vocabulary should not be a forced plant but should grow naturally with learning and experience.
  - |-
    A good dictionary is the key to extending your knowledge  
    of words. Try to keep one handy as you read. When you come  
    upon a word you don't know, pause and look it up. If you  
    can't stop or have no dictionary nearby, make a check in the  
    margin (assuming the book is your own) or write the word  
    on a piece of paper. Without such a reminder you will prob-  
    ably only remember that there was some word you intended  
    to look up which now you can't recall.
    
    As you write, don't be satisfied with thinking you know  
    what a word means or how it is spelled or functions gram-  
    matically. If you aren't sure, open the dictionary. It's sur-  
    prising how often what we think we know turns out to be  
    wrong.
    
    General Dictionaries
    
    A general dictionary lists the words currently used by speak-  
    ers and writers of a language or words readers are likely to  
    come across in older literature. If it includes all such terms, it  
    is unabridged. If it reduces the list by omitting many technical  
    or archaic words, it is an abridged edition, sometimes called  
    a desk dictionary.
    
    Two unabridged dictionaries are standard for modern En-  
    glish: Webster's Third New International Dictionary (G. &  
    C. Merriam Company) and the Oxford English Dictionary,  
    familiarly known as the Oxford University Press).
    
    We'll return to these massive works a little later.
    
    The abridged dictionary is of more immediate concern.  
    Several good ones are available.' Whichever you own, take a  
    little time to get familiar with its contents and organization.  
    A typical dictionary consists of three parts: the front matter,  
    the word list, and the back matter or appendixes.
    
    Front matter, which includes everything preliminary to the  
    word list, varies from work to work, but in all cases it explains  
    how the word list is set up, how to read an entry, what the  
    abbreviations mean, and so on. In addition front matter will  
    likely contain general information, valuable to any writer,  
    about English spelling, pronunciation, grammar, and usage.
  - |-
    Back matter, too, varies from book to book. Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary, for instance, discusses punctuation in its back matter and includes lists of famous persons, of important places, and of colleges in the United States and Canada. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language does not cover punctuation but includes people and places in the general word list.
    
    Although the front and the back matter contain much important information, the chief part of a dictionary is its word list. To use the word list efficiently you need to understand how entries are organized and the kind of information they give. We'll look at two typical entries in some detail. But first a caution: while a dictionary is an authority, its authority is of a special and limited nature. It does not tell you how a word should be spelled or spoken or used; it simply tells you how it is spelled or spoken or used. The forms and meanings of words depend on the speakers and writers of English. Acting in unconscious collectivity, we, all of us— constitute the "authority." Lexicographers collect hundreds, even thousands, of citations for each word they list. From these they determine how the word is actually pronounced and spelled, what meanings it is given, and any regional, social or occupational facts affecting its use. If a lexicographer has personal feelings about spelling, pronunciation, or definition, he or she does not substitute these for what the citations reveal.
  - |-
    The exact arrangement of information in a typical entry will vary a bit among dictionaries. But they all list words according to a principle of alphabetization explained in the front matter, and they all indicate spelling (along with any variations), stress, syllabication, pronunciation, grammatical function (verb, noun, adjective, and so on), the different senses in which the word is used (the order of these may be historical or it may be according to frequency), and usually information about the word's etymology (that is, its origin and history).
    
    Here are two sample entries, each with explanations. The first is from Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary:
    
    The second example comes from The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (see pages 340-345).
    
    Unabridged Dictionaries
    
    Occasionally you will come across a word not in your desk dictionary. Turn then to an unabridged work. The standard for American English is Webster's Third New International Dictionary (G. & C. Merriam Company). This is the volume you find in most libraries, usually on its own stand and open somewhere near the middle. (It should be left that way to protect the binding.)
    
    Webster's Third New International lists more than 450,000 words, including many older expressions and technical terms omitted from abridgments. In addition to the customary explanations, its front matter contains extensive discussions of spelling, punctuation, plural forms, the use of italics, and the handling of compound words. Accompanying the word list are thousands of illustrations (a few in the form of color plates) and numerous tables (the chemical elements, for instance, the Indo-European language family, radio frequencies, time zones, and so on).
  - |-
    Even more massive is the Oxford English Pubtionary, published by the Oxford University Press in twelve volumes with four volumes of supplements. Several features distinguish the OED. It lists older words than the Third New International and arranges definitions in historical order, illustrating each sense by dated quotations (totaling about 1,800,000). These begin with the earliest known use of a word in a particular sense and include, if possible, at least one instance for every century thereafter until the present (or until the last known example in the case of obsolete words or meanings). The dated citations make the OED indispensable for scholars studying the history of words or ideas.
    
    On the other hand, the OED is less useful for American English. For example, someone curious about the meaning of Chicago pool or the origin of OK will have to consult Webster's Third New International. Both unabridged dictionaries are necessary to a serious writer.
    
    Special Dictionaries: Thesauri
    
    Special dictionaries are restricted to a particular aspect of the general language or to the language of a specific group, profession, or region. There are hundreds of such works, many available in the reference section of most libraries.

  - |-
    The words "awake" and "awaken" are alike in meaning but differentiated in usage. Each has transitive and intransitive senses, but "awake" is used largely intransitively and "waken" transitively. In the passive voice, "awaken" and "waken" are the more frequent: "He was awakened (or wakened) by his call." In figurative usage, "awake" and "awaken" are the more prevalent: "He awoke to the danger; his suspicions were awakened." "Wake" is frequently used with "up"; the others do not take a preposition. The preferred past participle of "wake" is "waked," not "woke" or "woken": "When I had waked him, I discovered that the danger was past." The past participle of "awake" is "awaked," not "awoke": "He had awaked several times earlier in the night."
    
    "wake" (wak) n. 1. The visible track of turbulence left by something moving through the water: the wake of a ship. 2. The track or course left behind anything that has passed: "The dictionary law has naturally left in its wake defection, resentment, and counterrevolutionary sentiment. The wake of."

    Synonyms are words in the same language having much the same
    meaning. True, or identical, synonyms have exactly the same definition and usually are simply alternative names for the same object. In sailboats, for instance, "sail" and "guy" signify the same sail and are true synonyms. Most synonyms, however, are less than exact. For "pal" and "friend", they differ to a considerable degree, but are not exactly coextensive: any pal is a friend, but not any friend is a pal. In listing synonyms in a thesaurus necessarily obscures this distinction
    between exact and near synonyms. To distinguish all shades
    of meaning would result in a vast work of many volumes, too
    expensive to buy and too cumbersome to use.

    Roget's is probably the best known thesaurus. (The word  
    comes from Greek and means "treasure.") It was first pub-  
    lished in 1852 by Mark Peter Roget, an American physician  
    and professor, and entitled A Thesaurus of English Words and  
    Phrases, Classified and Arranged so as to Facilitate the Ex-  
    pression of Ideas and Assist in Literary Composition. Roget  
    devised a system of grouping words in numbered and sub-  
    divided categories of ideas. Users searching for terms mean-  
    ing, say, "friendship" could look under the appropriate cat-  
    egory. To make his book usable from the other direction—  
    that is, from word to ektegarnredRigat al-  
    phabetized index of words, each keyed to its category by the  
    appropriate number. Early in the twentieth century C. .  
    Mawson simplified Roget's scheme. Neither Roget nor the-  
    saurus is copyrighted, and a number of Roget's are currently  
    ancailainhes-afdaowet's original work, others of  
    Mawson's modification, and still others consisting of alpha-  
    betical listings without Roget's categories.
    
    Besides the various Roget's, there are other thesauri on the  
    market: The Random House Thesaurus (Random House);  
    Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus (G. & Merriam Company);  
    Webster's New World Thesaurus, edited by Charlton Laird  
    (World Publishing Company); and Webster's II Thesaurus  
    (Simon and Schuster). (Like Roget, the name Webster is not  
    copyrighted and is used by competing companies.)
    
    The limitations of most thesauri are revealed in the direc-  
    tions given in one edition of Roget:
    
    Turning to No. 866 (the sense required) we read through the varied  
    list of aydosyrast. the most appropriate expression.

    offer much help. For example, among the synonyms listed in

    one Roget under the category seclusion/exclusion are solitude,
    isolation, loneliness, and aloofness. They are merely listed as
    alternates with no distinctions drawn, but, except in a very
    loose sense, these words are not synonymous and may not be
    interchanged indiscriminately. Solitude means physical apart-
    ness, out of the sight and sound of others, a condition not
    necessarily undesirable; in fact, solitude may be used with
    positive connotations, as in "She enjoys solitude." Loneliness,
    on the other hand, has a more subjective significance, relating
    to the feeling of being apart; it does not necessarily imply
    physical seapaatlonebyomea crowd of Christ-
    
    mas sthepplitsreuardbe given a positive sense.
    
    Isolation stresses physical separation, out of connection and
    communication with others, and is often used when that sep-
    aration is not desired. Aloofness, finally, is self-chosen sepa-
    ration, a deliberate withdrawal from others, which may sug-
    gest a sense of superiority, though it does not have to.
    
    To use these "synonyms" effectively you need to know
    considerably more about them than a thesaurus is likely to
    tell you. With many wotlds—eshosple, for in-
    spanat-abridged dictionary is more helpful. That is
    not to say that a thesaurus is a waste of money. Used wisely
    it can improve your working vocabulary. It may remind you
    of a word you have forgotten, or acquaint you with a new
    one. But before you employ that new word learn more about
    it.
    
    A more useful source of synonyms is a work published by
    the G. & C. Merriam Company: Webster's Dictionary of Syn-
    onyms. It discusses meaning at greater length than does the
    typical thesaurus. For example, Webster's Collegiate Thesau-
    rus uses about one inch of a column for solitude, the
    Dictionary of Synonyms spends more than seven inches, care-
    fully distinguishing solitude from isolation, loneliness, and so
    on.

    Looks, sounds, tastes. Mostly it is about visual experience, but
    description also deals with other kinds of perception. The fol-
    lowing passage, for example, uses sounds to describe the be-
    ginning of an act of revolutionary violence in China:
    
    Five shots went off in a nearby street: three together, another, still
    another. . . . The silence returned, but it no longer seemed to be the
    same. Suddenly it was filled by the clatter of horses' hoofs, hurried,
    coming nearer and nearer. And, like the vertical laceration of light-
    ning after a prolonged thunder, while they still saw nothing, a tu-
    mult suddenly filled the street, composed of mingled cries, shots,
    furious whinnyings, the falling of bodies; then, as the subsiding
    clamor was heavily choking under the indestructible silence, there
    rose a cry as of a dog howling lugubriously, cut short: a man with
    his throat slashed. André Malraux
    
    Whatever sense it appeals to, descriptive writing is of two
    broad kinds: objective and subjective. In objective description
    the writer sets aside those aspects of the perception unique to
    himself and concentrates on describing the percept (that is,
    what is perceived) in itself. In subjective (also called impres-
    sionistic) description a writer projects his or her feelings into
    the percept. Objective description says, "This is how the
    thing is"; subjective, "This is how the thing seems to one
    particular consciousness."
    
    Neither kind of description is more "honest." Both are (or
    can be) true, but they are true in different ways. The truth of
    objective description lies in its relationship to fact; that of
    subjective in relationship to feeling or evaluation. The first
    kind of truth is more easily checked. We can generally decide
    which of two passages more accurately describes, say, a
    downtown office building. Subjective description, on the
    other hand, is "true" because it presents a valuable response,
    not because it makes an accurate report. If we do not agree
    with how a writer feels about something, we cannot say that
    the description is false. We can say only that it is not true for
    us; that we do not share his or her feelings.

    Nor are these two approaches hard-and-fast categories into
    which any piece of descriptive writing must fall. Most de-
    scriptions involve both, in varying degrees. Generally, how-
    ever, one mode will dominate and fix the focus. In scientific
    and legal writing, for instance, objectivity is desirable. In per-
    sonal writing subjectivity is more likely.
    
    But in both kinds, success hinges on three things: (1) details
    that are sharply defined images, appealing to one or another
    of the senses; (2) details that are selected according to a guid-
    ing principle; (3) details that are clearly organized.
    
    Objective Description
    Selection of Detail
    
    In objective description the principle which guides selection
    is the thing itself. The writer must ask: Which details are es-
    sential to seeing and understanding this object, event, person,
    experience? Which are accidental and of lesser importance?
    Essential details should make up the bulk of the description,
    those of secondary importance being included as the writer
    has space.
    
    The following description of a freshwater fish by an eigh-
    teenth-century naturalist exemplifies the selection of essential
    detail:
    
    The loach, in its general aspect, has a pellucid appearance: its back
    is mottled with irregular collections of small black dots, not reach-
    ing much below the /ategalis, as are the back and tail fins: a
    black line runs from each eye down to the nose; its belly is of a
    silvery white; the upper jaw projects beyond the lower, and is sur-
    rounded with six feelers, three on each side; its pectoral fins are
    large, its ventral much smaller; the fin behind its anus small; its
    dorsal fin large, containing eight spines; its tail, where it joins the
    tail-fin, remarkably broad, without any typam*esshe char-
    
    acteristic of this genus; the tail-fin is broad, and square at the end.
    From the breadth and muscular strength of the tail, it appears to be
    an active nimble fish. Gilbert White
    
    White focuses on those features that enable us to recognize a
    loach: size and shape of tail and fins, number of feelers on
    each side of the jaw, and so on. Scientific description like this
    is a kind of definition, differentiating an entity from others
    similar to it.
    
    Organization of Details
  - |-
    Objective description, especially the visual kind, often begins  
    with a brief comprehensive view. It then analyzes this image  
    and presents each part in detail, following an organization  
    inherent in the object. Here, for instance, is a description of  
    a lake in Maine:
    
    The lake resembles a gently curving S, its long axis lying  
    almost due north-south. The shoreline is ringed by rocks of all sizes,  
    from huge boulders to tiny particles—glacial debris from the Ice Age.
    
    Beyond the rocks the forest comes almost to the water's edge.  
    Mostly pine and hemlock, it contains a few hardwoods—maple,  
    oak, birch. Here and there an old pine, its roots washed nearly  
    clean of support, leans crazily over the water, seeming about to  
    topple at any instant. But it never does; trees fall this way for years.
    
    354 DESCRIPTION AND NARRATION
    
    First we view the lake in its entirety, as a hawk might see it.  
    Then we focus down and move progressively closer to shore.  
    We see the rocks immediately at the water's edge, then the  
    forest, then the various kinds of trees, and finally the old pine  
    leaning over the water. The description, in short, is organized:  
    it moves from general to particular, and it divides the visual  
    experience of the lake into three parts—the whole,  
    
    the shoreline, and the forest around.
    
    To effect these changes in viewpoint, the writer does not  
    waste time directing us. He does not say, "As we leave the  
    bird's-eye view and come down for a closer look, we observe  
    that the shoreline is ringed with rocks." It is awkward and  
    wordy to turn tour guide. It is better to move about the object  
    implicitly without holding the reader by the hand. Doing this  
    usually requires an impersonal and omniscient point of view:  
    impersonal in the sense that the writer does not refer to him-  
    self or herself; omniscient in that nothing is hidden, and he  
    or she can range with complete freedom—above,  
    around the object, inside and out. Readers will follow if the  
    writer has clearly organized what they are supposed to see.
  - |-
    But he or she must organize. Writers of good description do not just "see." They analyze what they see and give it a pattern. Taking a perception apart in order to put it together can be seen in the following sentence by Joseph Conrad, which describes a coastal view. The angle of vision does not change as it did in the description of the lake, but there is a principle of organization:
    
    Beyond the sea wall there curves for miles in a vast and regular sweep the barren beach of shingle, with the village of Brenzett standing out darkly across the water, a spire in a clump of trees; and still further out the perpendicular column of a lighthouse, looking in the distance no bigger than a lead pencil, marks the vanishing point of the land.
    
    Our view shifts from near to distant. Our eyes move outward through a series of receding planes: the sea wall, the beach,
    Description 355
    
    the village with its spire and trees across the water, and the lighthouse in the offing.
    
    Diction in Objective Description
    
    In objective description words are chosen for exactness of denotation, not for forcefulness of connotation. Factual precision is what is most desired. Gilbert White (page 254) says "six feelers, three on each side," not "several feelers." He carefully differentiates fins by concise technical names: "pectoral," "ventral," "dorsal."
    
    Scientific description like this is not easy to write. Given enough time to observe and the training to know what to look for, anyone can compose a reasonably accurate description of a fiaht. It requires more care to compose a description that is accurate and at the same time forceful, interesting prose. It is worth studying White's paragraph to observe how he or ganizes it and gives it vitality and movement by the short, direct clauses, constructed with just enough variety to avoid monotony.
    
    Subjective Description

    When describing objectively, the writer is a kind of camera, recording precisely and impersonally. When writing subjectively, he or she is no longer an impartial observer, but rather enters into what is perceived. Point of view—in cases—becomes personal; and words have overtones of value and feeling that color the perception.
    
    These evaluations and feelings are as much a part of the description as the object itself. In fact, more: they determine selection and organization. Sometimes writers state impressions directly, as in this paragraph about an Englishwoman's reactions to the citizens of Moscow:
    
    { wandered about in the morning and looked at the streets and people. All my visit looked and looked at the people. They seem neither happier nor sadder than in the West, and neither more nor less worried than any town dweller. (People in towns are always preoccupied. "Have missed the bus? Have forgotten the potatoes? Can get across the road?") But they appear stupid, what the French call abruti. What do they think? Perhaps they don't think very much, and yet they read enormously. I have never seen such a country of seditherson pespdiees, in the metro, etc., all read books (magazines seem not to exist); on the trains they have lending libraries. They are hideously ugly. Except for a few young officers, I have never seen a handsome man; there seem to be no beautiful women. They have putty faces, like Malenkov. It is nonsense to speak of Asiatics, Mongol Hordes and so prettytltietle Tartar guards at Lenin's tomb were the only people saw with non-European feadtias. Nancy Mitford
    
    Fixing the Impression in Images
    
    While subjective description often states an impression directly, it cannot rest on abstract statement. Feeling must be fixed in images, in details appealing to the senses. Only details, emotionally charged, make the impression real.
  - |-
    No more dreary spectacle can be found on this earth than the whole of the "awful East," with its Whitechapel, Hoxton, Spitalfields, Bethnal Green, and Wapping to the East India Docks. The colour of life is grey and drab. Everything is helpless, hopeless, unrelieved, and dirty. Bath tubs are a thing totally unknown, as mythical as the ambrosia of the gods. The people themselves are dirty, while any attempt at cleanliness becomes howling farce, when it is not pitiful and tragic. Strange, vagrant odours come drifting along the greasy wind, and the rain, when it falls, is more like grease than water from heaven. The very cobblestones are scummed with grease.
    
    Jack London
    
    London, writing in b6@ijs by telling us what impression the slums of London's east end make on him: "no more dreary spectacle"; "the colour of life is grey and drab"; "everything is helpless, hopeless, unrelieved, and dirty." But we don't experience the impression until he renders it in images:
    
    DESCRIPTION 357
    
    "vagrant odours," "greasy wind," "rain... like grease," "cobblestones ... scummed with grease."
    
    You can see that details work differently in impressionistic description than in objective. Connotations are more important, and diction is charged with emotion. The writer wants to arouse in readers a response like his own. But he must do more than merely tell us how he feels. He must re-create the scene in a algafatanalyner, including this detail and omitting that, exaggerating one image and underplaying another, and calling up compelling similes and metaphors.
  - |-
    In short, the perception must be refracted through the writer's consciousness. It may emerge idealized, like a landscape by a romantic painter. It may be distorted and made ugly, like a reflection in a funhouse mirror. Idealization and distortion are perfectly legitimate. The writer of subjective description signs no contract to deliver literal truth. "Here," he or she says, "is how I see it." Yet the description may reveal a deeper truth than mere objective accuracy, and, like an artist's caricature, make plain a subtle reality.
    
    To convey subjective truth, then, a writer must embody responses in the details of the scene. Often, in fact, he or she relies exclusively upon such embodiment, making little or no statement of feeling and, instead, forcing the perception to speak for itself. A simple case is catalogue description, in which the writer lists detail after detail, each contributing to a dominant impression. The following paragraph is a good example (it describes an outdoor market on Decatur Street in New Orleans):
    
    The booths are Sicilian, hung with red peppers, draped with garlic, piled with fruit, wet vegetables, fresh and dried herbs. A huge man, fat as Silenus, daintily binds bunches for soup, while his wife quarters cabbages, ties smaller bundles of thyme, parsley, green onions, small hot peppers and sweet pimentos to season gumbo. Another Italian with white mustache, smiling fiercely from a tanned face, offers jars of green file powder, unground all-spice, pickled onions in vinegar. Carts and trucks flank the sidewalk; one walks through crates of curled parsley, scallions piled with ice,

    wagonloads of spinach with tender mauve stalks, moist baskets of crisp kale; sacks of white onions in oyster-white fishnet, pink onions in sacks of old rose; piles of eggplant with purple reflections, white garlic and long sea-green leeks with shredded roots, grey-white like witches' hair. Boxes of artichokes fit their leaves into a complicated pattern. Trucks from Happy Jack, Boothville, and Buras have unloaded their oranges; a long red truck is selling cabbages, green peppers, squashes long and curled like the trumpets of Jericho. There is more than Jordaens profusion, an abundance more glittering in color than Pourbus. A blue truck stands in sunlight, Negroes clambering over its sides, seven men in faded jeans, washing-blue overalls; the last is a mulatto in a sweater of pure sapphire. A mangy cat steps across a roadway of crushed oranges and powdered oyster-shells. John Bishop Peale
    
    Not only the individual details, but their very profusion convey vitality and abundance far more effectively than would any plain statement. It is not possible to overestimate the importance of specificity to good description. Look back at how carefully Bishop names colors.
    
    While details in catalogues are chosen according to an underlying feeling or evaluation, the selection is less rigorous than in some other kinds of subjective description. Thus Bishop includes the "mangy cat" and the "crushed oranges," even though these jar slightly with the attractiveness of the scene. More often the writer "edits" the perception, using fewer details and only those conducive to the impression. The novelist Thomas Wolfe, for example, draws this picture of an idealized, if modest, home:
  - |-
    On the outskirts of a little town upon a rise of land that swept back from the railway there was a tidy little cottage of white boards, trimmed vividly with green blinds. To one side of the house there was a garden neatly patterned with plots of growing vegetables, and an arbor for the grapes which ripened late in August. Before the house there were three mighty oaks which sheltered it in their clean and massive shade in summer, and to the other side there was a border of gay flowers. The whole place had an air of tidiness, thrift, and modest comfort.
    
    DESCRIPTION 359
    
    The final sentence sums up the scene and states the impression directly, as to the modifiers "neatly," "clean," "gay," but on the whole the images create the sense of middle-class fulfillment. Any ugliness is excluded. If the lawn were disfigured by crabgrass, if weeds leered among the flowers, the facts are discreetly omitted.
    
    Very different are the tessellations—and = impression—in account of the homes of miners in the north of England:
    
    I found great variation in the houses visited. Some were as decent as one could possibly expect in the circumstances, some were so appalling that have no hope of describing them adequately. To begin with, the smell, the dominant and essential thing, is indescribable. But the squalor and the confusion! A tub full of filthy water here, a basin full of unwashed crocks there, more crocks piled in any odd corner, torn newspaper littered everywhere, and in the middle always the same dreadful table covered with sticky oilcloth and crowded with cooking pots and irons and half-darned stockings and pieces of stale bread and bits of cheese wrapped round with greasy newspaper! And the congestion in a tiny room where getting from one side to the other is a complicated voyage between pieces of furniture, with a line of damp washing getting you in the face every time you move and the children as thick uoddeianl sis George Orwell
    
    Sometimes a writer concentrates on one or two images which symbolize the impression. In the following passage Al-fred Kazin projects into two key symbols his childhood despair at being forced to attend a special school because of his stuttering:

    stopped to catch my breath on a corner of Sutter Avenue, near the  
    wholesale fruit markets, where an old drugstore rose up over a great  
    flight of steps. In the window were dusty urns of colored water floating off iron chains; cardboard placards advertising hairnets, EX-  
    LAX; a great illustrated medical chart headed THE HUMAN FACTORY, which showed the exact course a mouthful of food follows as it falls from chamber to chamber of the body. hadn't meant to stop there at all, only to catch my breath; but 60 hated the speech

    sitting on the steps before THE HUMAN FACTORY, where little robots
    gathered and shoveled the food from chamber to chamber of the
    body. They had put me out into the streets, thought to myself; with
    their mirrors and their everlasting pulling at me to imitate their ef-
    fortless bright speech and their stupefaction that a boy could stam-
    mer and stumble on every other English word he carried in his
    head, they put me out into the streets, had left me high and dry on
    the steps of that drugstore staring at the remains of my lunch turning
    black and grimy in the dust.
    
    In Kazin's description selection is extremely important.
    The passage focuses onto the images of THE HUMAN FAC-
    TORY and the two pieces of salami. Kazin tells us what his
    feelings were (he is quite explicit). But he communicates the
    despair of an alienated child in the salami with its "odd thread
    of hair ... turning black and grimy in the dust," and the in-
    human little robots endlessly shoveling food into a body that
    DESCRIPTION 361
    
    has become a machine. In a world symbolized by such images
    there is little room for humane values, for love and compas-
    sion and tender understanding.
    
    Kazin's paragraph shows the importance of the "crystalliz-
    ing image," the detail that precipitates the scene in the reader's
    mind. The writer must make readers see (or hear or taste or
    touch). He or she cannot achieve this merely by relentlessly
    listing every detail that falls within the perceptual field. Even
    in catalogue descriptions like that by John Peale Bishop, we
    are shown only a portion of what exists to be seen. The writer
    must select relatively few details but render these so vividly
    that a reader sees them in his mind's eye. These will then
    crystalize the perception, making it solid and true. It is rather
    like developing a photograph. The writer begins the process,
    carefully choosing details and expressing them in compelling
    images; readers, developing these images in the fluid of their
    own experience, complete the picture for themselves.
  - |-
    The point to remember is this: select only the details essential to the impression you want to convey; describe them precisely and concretely; then readers will perceive them.
    
    Metaphor and Simile in Subjective Description
    
    In addition to selecting and arranging details, the writer of description may also introduce comparisons, often in the form of metaphors or similes. In Bishop's paragraph about the Decatur Street Market, for instance, the proprietor is "fat as Silenus" (an ancient god of wine), the leeks "sea-green" with roots "like witches' hair," and the squashes "long and curled like the trumpets of Jericho."
    
    Metaphor is even more central in the following passage about the Great Wall of China. The Wall assumes a monstrous power as it marches over and dominates the lands:
    
    There in the mist, enormous, majestic, silent and terrible, stood the Great Wall of China. Solitarily, with the indifference of nature herself, it crept up the mountain side and slipped down to the depth
    of the valley. Menacingly, the grim watch towers, stark and four square, at due intervals stood at their posts. Ruthlessly, for it was built at the cost of a million lives and each one of those great grey stones has been stained with the bloody tears of the captive and the outcast, it forged its dark way through a sea of rugged moun-
    tains. Fearlessly, it went on its endless journey, league upon league to the furthermost regions of Asia, in utter solitude, mysterious like the great empire it guarded. There in the mist, enormous, majestic, silent, and terrible, stood the Great Wall of China.
    
    W. Somerset Maugham
    
    Exaggerating Details
    
    An impression may be embodied in distorted and exaggerated
    details. Mark Twain, an adept at the art of hyperbole, or ex-
    aggeration, tells of a trip he took in an overland stage in the
    1860s. The passengers have spent the night at a way station,
    and Twain describes the facilities for cleaning up before
    breakfast the next morning:
  - |-
    By the door, inside, was fastened a small old-fashioned looking-glass frame, with two little fragments of the original mirror lodged down in one corner of it. This arrangement afforded a pleasant double-barreled portrait of you when you looked into it, with one half of your head set up a couple of inches above the other half. From the glass frame hung the half of a comb by a string—but had to describe that patriarch or die, believe would order some sample coffins. It had come down from Esau and Samson, and had been accumulating hair ever since.
    
    We are not supposed to take this literally, of course. Twain is exercising the satirist's right of legitimate exaggeration, legitimate because it leads us to see a truth about this frontier hostel.
    
    Process Description
    
    A process is a directed activity in which something undergoes progressive change. The process may be natural, like the growth of a tree; or it may be humanly directed, like an automobile taking shape on an assembly line. But always something is happening—something being formed, an end of some kind being achieved.
    
    To describe a process you must analyze its stages. The analysis will determine how you organize the description. In a simple case, such as baking a cake, the process has obvious, prescribed steps; the writer needs only to observe and record them accurately. On the other hand, complicated and abstract processes—such as the formation of a law comes into being as an act of invention.
    
    Here is a simple example of a process, a natural one—a small frog being eaten by a giant water bug:

    He didn't jump; crept closer. At last he fell on the island's winterkilled grass, lost, dumbstruck, staring at the frog in the creek just four feet away. He was a very small frog with wide, dull eyes. And just as looked at him, he slowly crumpled and began to sag. The spirit vanished from his eyes as if snuffed. His skin emptied and drooped; his very skull seemed to collapse and settle like a kicked tent. He was shrinking before my eyes like a deflating football. I watched the taut, glistening skin on his shoulders ruck, and rumple, and fall. Soon, part of his skin, formless as a pricked balloon, lay in floating folds like bright scum on top of the water: it was a monstrous and terrifying thing. Shaped bewildered, appalled. An oval shadow hung in the water behind the drained frog; then the shadow glided away. The frog skin bag began to sink. Annie Dillard
    
    At the beginning of the description the frog is whole and alive, sitting in the creek; by the end it has been reduced to a bag of skin. This change is the process Dillard describes. It is continuous rather than divided into clearly defined steps. Yet it is analyzed. Verbs, the key words in the analysis, create sharp images of alteration: "crumpled," "collapse," "shrinking," "deflating," "ruck," "rumple," "fall." The similes and metaphors translate an unusual visual experience into more familiar ones: "like a deflating football," "formless as a pricked balloon."
    
    364 DESCRIPTION AND NARRATION
    
    The next example of process description involves an assembly line at a cosmetics plant:
    
    Cream-jar covers joggle along a moving belt. Six iron arms descend to set paper sealers on sewtuplicatam pots. Each clattering cover is held for a moment in a steel disk as a filled cream jar is raised by a metal wrist and screwed on from underneath.
  - |-
    At the mascara merry-go-round a tiny tube is placed in each steel
    cup—cul pk. circle—ca-chong, ca-chong, ca-chong—till
    they pass under two metal udders. There the cups jerk up—ping—
    and the tubes are filled with mascara that flows from the vats up-
    stairs in manufacturing. The cups continue their circle till they pass
    under a €appetedpkapped tubes circle some more
    till they reach two vacuum nozzles, then—fwap—sucked
    around and down onto a betving
    
    All along the belt women in blue smocks, sitting on high stools,
    pick up each mascara tube as it goes past. They insert brushes, tamp
    on labels, encase the tubes in plastic and then cardboard for the
    drugstore displays.
    
    At the Brush-On Peel-Off Mask line, a filler picks an empty bottle
    off the belt with her right hand, presses a pedal with her foot, fills
    the bottle with a bldxbpe goop, changes hands, and puts the
    filled bottle back on the line with her left hand, as she picks up
    another empty bottle with her right hand. The bottles go past at
    thirty-three a minute. Barbara Carson
    
    Garson's description provides a &mample of how analysis
    determines paragraphing. Three products are involved—
    cream, mascara, and the "Brush-On Peel-Off Mask'—and
    each is treated in a separate paragraph. For the mascara two
    are used, marking the two-stage process of the tubes' being
    fisted and then packaged.
    
    The sentences are also determined by the analysis. Thus the
    three sentences of the first paragraph distinguish (1) the
    covers on the conveyor belt, (2) the iron arms placing sealers
    on the pots, and (3) the fixing of the lids onto the jars. Notice,
    too, the long sentence in the fourth paragraph; it uses parallel
    verbs to analyze the filler's movements.

    Process description may be either objective or subjective.
    Both the foregoing examples are relatively objective, though
    each suggests responses. Even though Dillard's subject is hor-
    rifying and she actually expresses her reaction ("it was a mon-
    strous and terrifying thing"), her images are objective. Dillard
    concentrates on rendering the visual experience in and of itself
    (which in a case like this perhaps best communicates the
    horror).
    
    Despite its objective surface, Garson's description also im-
    plies a reaction. Her thetwonrdsespricaalhy

    Her fourth paragraph cleverly hints her feelings about work
    on the line. The long elaborate first sentence describing the
    worker's mechanized movements is followed by a brief
    matter-of-fact announcement that "the bottles go past at
    thirty-three a minute." The implication makes sensitive read-
    ers wince.
    
    CHAPTER
    
    Narration
    
    A narrative is a meaningful sequence of events told in words.
    It is sequential in that the events are ordered, not merely ran-
    dom. Sequence always involves an arrangement in time (and
    usually other arrangements as well). A straightforward move-
    ment from the &rsnt to the last constitutes the simplest
    chronology. However, chronology is sometimes complicated
    by presenting the events in another order: for example, a story
    may open with the &iabde and then flash back to all
    
    that preceded it.
    
    A narrative has meaning in that it conveys an evaluation of
    some kind. The writer reacts to the story he or she tells, and
    states or implies that reaction. This is the "meaning," some-
    times called the "theme," of a story. Meaning must always be
    rendered. The writer has to do more than tell us the truth he
    sees in the story; he must manifest that truth in the characters
    and the action.
    
    Characters and action are the essential elements of any
    story. Also important, but not as essential, is the setting, the
    place where the action occurs. Characters are usually people—
    sometimes actual people, as in history books or newspaper
    stories, sometimes imaginary ones, as in novels. Occasionally
    characters are animals (as in an Aesop fable), and sometimes
    
    NARRATION 367
    
    a dominant feature of the environment functions almost like
    a character (the sea, an old house).
  - |-
    The action is what the characters say and do and anything that happens to them, even if it arises from a nonhuman source, instance, or a fire. Action is often presented in the form of a plot. Action is, so to speak, the raw material; plot, the finished product, the fitting together of the bits and pieces of action into a coherent pattern. Usually, though not invariably, plot takes the form of a cause-and-effect chain: event A produces event B; B leads to C; C to D; and so on until the final episode, X. In a well-constructed plot of this kind we can work back from X to A and see the connections that made the end of the story likely and perhaps inevitable.
    
    Stories can be very long and complicated, with many characters, elaborate plots, and subtle interpenetration of character, action, and setting. In writing that is primarily expository, however, narratives are shorter and simpler. Most often they are factual rather than imaginary, as when an historian describes an event. And often in exposition an illustration may involve a simple narrative. Being able to tell a story, then, while not the primary concern of the expository writer, is a skill which he or she will now and again be called upon to use.
    
    Organizing a Narrative
    
    As with so much in composition, the first step in narration is to analyze the story in your own mind. In the actual telling, the analysis provides the organization. The simplest kind of narrative is the episode, a single event unified by time and place. But even an episode must be organized. The writer must break it down into parts and present these in a meaningful order.
    
    In the following case the episode is the brief landing of a passenger ship at the Mediterranean island of Malta. After describing the setting in the first paragraph, the writer divides his story into two parts: the problems of getting ashore (paragraphs 2 and 3), and the difficulties of returning to the ship (4).
  - |-
    We called at Malta, a curious town where there is nothing but  
    churches, and the only sound of life is the ringing of church bells.  
    The whole place reminded me of the strange towns one often sees  
    in the nightmares of delirium.
    
    As soon as the ship anchored, a regular battle began between  
    the boatmen for possession of the passengers. These unhappy crea-  
    tures were hustled hither and thither, and finally one, waving his  
    arms like a marionette unhinged, lost his balance and fell back into  
    a boat. It immediately bore him off with a cry of triumph, and the  
    defeated boatman revenged himself by carrying off his luggage in a different direction. All this took place amid a baibaths in  
    Maltese, with many suggestive Arab words intermingled.
    
    The young priests in the second class, freshly hatched out of the  
    seminary, turned vividly pink, and the good nuns covered their  
    faces with their veils and fled under the mocking gaze of an old  
    bearded missionary, who wasn't to be upset by such trifles.
    
    I did not go ashore, for getting back to the ship was too much of  
    a problem. Some passengers had to pay a veritable ransom before  
    they could return. Two French sailors, who had got mixed up with  
    churches when looking for a building of quite another character,  
    solved the matter very simply by throwing their grasping boatman  
    into the sea. A few strokes with the oars, and they were alongside,  
    and as a tug was just leaving they tied the little boat to it, to the  
    accompaniment of the indignant shrieks from the owner as he  
    floundered in the water. Henry de Montreid
    
    In each of the two main parts of the story de Monfreid begins  
    with a generalization and then supports it with a specific in-  
    stance. The effectiveness of his narrative lies both in the skill  
    with which he analyzes the episode and the precision with  
    which he renders characters and action. The glimpses he gives  
    us are brief, but vivid and filled with meaning: the tumbled  
    passenger "like a marionette unhinged," "the mocking...  
    missionary," the shrieking indignation of the greedy boatman  
    thrown into the sea.
    
    NARRATION 369
  - |-
    Their nightmare quality, which is the dominant note of the setting, unifies these details. But their causal connections are relatively unimportant. For example, the sailors do not toss their boatman into the water because of what other boatmen did earlier to the unfortunate passenger. The two events relate not as cause and effect but more generally in showing the greediness of the Maltese.
    
    In more complicated stories, however, events may well be linked in a plot of cause and effect. A brief example of such a plot appears in this account of a murder in New York occasioned by the Great Depression of the 1930s:
    
    Peter Romano comes from a little town in Sicily. For years he kept a large and prosperous fruit store under the Second Avenue elevated at the corner of Twenty-ninth Street. A few years ago, however, he got something the matter with his chest and wasn't able to work anymore. He sold his business and put the money into Bidet.
    
    When the Wall Street crash came, Peter Romano &hstost everything. And by the time that Mrs. Romano had had a baby five months ago and had afterwards come down with pneumonia, he found he had only a few dollars left.
    
    By June, he owed his landlord two months' rent, $52. The land-
    lord, Antonio Copace, lived only a few blocks away on Lexington
    Avenue, in a house with a brownstone front and coarse white-lace
    curtains in the windows. The Romanos lived above the fruit store,
    on the same floor with a cheap dentist's office, in a little flat to
    which they had access up a dirty oilcloth-covered staircase and
    through a door with dirty-margined panes. The Romanos regarded
    Mr. Copace as a very rich man, but he, too, no doubt, had been
    having his losses.
  - |-
    At any rate, he was insistent about the rent. Peter Romano had
    a married daughter, and her husband offered to help him out. He
    went to Mr. Copace with §2f#th‘enent. But the old man
    refused it with fury and said that unless he got the whole sum right
    away, he would have the Romanos evicted. On June hé,came
    himself to the Romanos and demanded the money again. He threat-
    ened to have the marshal in and put them out that very afternoon.
    Peter Romano tried to argue with him, and Mrs. Romano went out
    in a final desperate effort to get together $52.
    
    370 DESCRIPTION AND NARRATION
    
    When she came back empty-handed, she found a lot of people
    outside the house and, upstairs, the police in her flat. Peter had
    shot Mr. Copace and killed him, and was just being taken off to
    jail. Edmund Wilson
    
    Chronology is the bony structure of Wilson's little story:
    "For years he Kefaw.years ago... When the Wall
    
    Street crash came ... By June ... On June 11 When Mrs.
    Romano came back...." This temporal skeleton supports a
    cause-and-effect plot. The basic elements of such a plot are
    the exposition, the conflict, the climax, and the denouement.
    
    The term exposition has a special meaning with reference
    to narration. The exposition is that part of the plot which
    gives us the background information about the characters,
    telling us what we need to know in order to understand why
    they act as they do in what is about to unfold. Exposition is
    usually, but not always, concentrated at or very near the be-
    ginning of a story. Wilson's exposition occupies the fhurste
    paragraphs, which locate Peter Romano in time and place and
    tell us necessary facts about his history.
    
    Exposition gives way to teeflastond part of a plot.

    Conflict involves two or more forces working at cross purposes. (Sometimes this takes place between a character and a physical obstacle such as a mountain or the sea; or it may be internalized, involving diverse psychological aspects of the same person.) In this story the conflict, obviously, occurs between tenant and landlord. The third part of a plot, the climax, resolves the conflict: here, the shooting. Finally the plot ends with the denouement, the closing events of the narrative: Peter Romano's being carried off to jail.
    
    In the simple and often partial stories you are likely to tell in expository writing, it is not always necessary (or even desirable) that you develop all these elements of a plot in detail. You may need to spend your time on exposition and treat the climax and denouement very briefly. Or you may wish to slight the exposition and concentrate on the climax. But in any case you must be clear in your own mind about the structure of your plot and know how much of each element your readers need in order to understand your narrative.
    
    In organizing a story, then, you should ask these questions. (1) What is the plot? Specify: What is the climax? What events leading to the climax constitute the conflict? What should be included in the exposition? What events following the climax (the denouement) should be told? (2) What are the salient qualities of the characters and how can these best be revealed in speech and action? (3) What details of setting will help readers understand the characters?
    
    Meaning in Narrative
    
    How you answer those questions depends on what you want the story to mean. Meaning in narrative is a complex matter. Broadly there are three kinds: allegorical, realistic, and symbolic. In allegories the meaning is an abstract "truth" —moral, political, cosmic— which and setting are contrived to express. Often what happens in an allegory is not realistic or credible in terms of everyday experience. What it all means must be looked for on the abstract level of ideas.
    
    A Queen named Superba drawn in a allegory by a painter might symbolize the ideal of power or virtue. The setting, such as a castle or a throne room, is designed to reflect the themes of the story. The characters and events are chosen to reinforce the symbolic meaning rather than to depict a realistic scenario.
    
    In realistic narratives, the meaning is derived from the depiction of real life and human experiences. The setting, characters, and events are true to life, and the story aims to reflect authentic situations and emotions. The meaning is often found in the characters' actions, relationships, and the overall atmosphere of the story.
    
    Symbolic narratives use symbols, metaphors, and other literary devices to convey deeper meanings. The meaning is not always immediately apparent and often requires the reader to interpret the symbols and their significance within the context of the story.
    
    In summary, the meaning of a narrative depends on its genre and purpose. Whether allegorical, realistic, or symbolic, the story's meaning is shaped by its elements and the way they are presented. Understanding these aspects helps in crafting a narrative that communicates its intended message effectively to the reader.

    six strangely assorted beasts begins to make sense only when
    we realize that Superba stands for the mortal sin of Pride and
    that the animals represent the other six deadly sins. We have
    to think theologically in terms of sin and damnation to un-
    derstand what the poet Edmund Spenser was saying.
    
    In realism, on the other hand, meaning exists in the surface
    events. We don't interpret characters or plot as emblems of
    thought or feeling. De Mominsid's the landing at
    Malta is an example. It has a meaning, or meanings: Maltese
    boatmen are greedy; their greed is punished; young priests are
    naive. But these are generalizations drawn from what literally
    happens.
    
    In symbolic stories meaning is neither purely allegorical
    nor purely realistic. It is both at once. Such stories are realistic
    in that characters and events correspond to life as we know
    it, and we can generalize from them to real people. At the
    same time the shamethehikevallegories—point
    
    of significance, more abstract and more inclusive. Edmund
    Wilson's tale, for instance, conveys both a particular (realistic)
    and a more abstract (allegorical) meaning. Read literally, the
    natrative is the tragedy of two men made desperate by eco-
    nomic frustration, and we may fairly apply it to similar men
    in similar circumstances. At the same time the story can be
    seen in Marxist terms as revealing the impersonal forces of
    the exploiting bourgeoisie and the dispossessed urban prole-
    tariat, each the victim of a capitalist economy, each the vic-
    timizer of the other.
    
    In practice, many stories operate, so to speak, at interme-
    diate points of meaning. The meaning of one narrative is re-
    alistic tending toward the symbolic; of another, symbolic
    tending toward the allegorical.
  - |-
    Whatever its mode, the meaning of a story, if it is to be  
    truly communicated, has to be rendered in the characters and  
    plot and setting. It may, in addition, be announced. That is,  
    the writer may explicitly tell us what meaning he or she sees  
    in the story. Sometimes such a statement of theme occurs at  
    the end of a story (the "moral" at the end of a fable, for  
    instance), sometimes at the beginning, sometimes in between.  
    Thus the following account of the execution in 1618 of Sir  
    Walter Raleigh begins with an announcement of its signifi-  
    cance. But the writer does not rest content with telling us the  
    theme. He is careful to select appropriate details of speech  
    and action and to ground his theme in them:
    
    Immortal in the memory of our race, the scene of Raleigh's death  
    has come to us with its vividness undimmed by the centuries. Every-  
    thing that had been mean, false, or petty in his life had somehow  
    been sloughed off. The man who went to the block was the heroic  
    Raleigh who all along had existed as Sir Walter's ideal and now  
    was to become a national legend.
      
    NARRATION 373
    
    He had been lodged in the gatehouse at Westminster. At mid-  
    night his wife left him for the last time, and miraculously he lay  
    down and slept for a few hours. Early in the morning the Dean of  
    Westminster gave him his last communion. Afterwards he had his  
    breakfast and enjoyed his last pipe of tobacco. At eight o'clock he  
    started on his short journey to the scaffold erected in Old Palace  
    Yard.
    
    Raleigh, so completely a man of the Renaissance, was inevitably  
    concerned at the time with thoughts of fame beyond death. In his  
    speech from the scaffold he did what he could to protect that fame,  
    assuring his hearers that he was a true Englishman who had never  
    passed under allegiance to the King of France. He was concerned  
    also that men should not believe the old slander that he had puffed  
    tobacco smoke at Essex when the earl had come to die. At the end  
    he concluded:
  - |-
    And now entreat that you all will join me in prayer to that Great  
    God of Heaven whom have so grievously offended, being a  
    man full of all vanity, who has lived a sinful life in such callings  
    as have been most inducing to it; for have been a soldier, a  
    sailor, and a courtier, which are courses of wickedness and vice;  
    that His Almighty goodness will forgive me; that He will cast  
    away my sins from me, and that He will receive me into ever-  
    lasting life; so take my leave of you all, making my peace with  
    God.
    
    There followed the famous moment in which Raleigh asked to  
    see the axe. The headsman was reluctant to show it. "I prithee, let  
    me see it," said Raleigh, and he asked, "Dost thou think that am  
    afraid of it?" Running his finger along the edge he mused, "This is  
    sharp medicine, but it is a sound cure for all diseases." There was  
    some fussing about the way he should have his head on the block.  
    Somebody insisted that it should be towards the east. Changing his  
    position, Raleigh uttered a last superb plataseheWhat  
    the head lie, so the heart be right?" He prayed briefly, gave the  
    signal to the headsman, and died.
    
    The headsman needed two strokes to sever the head. After hold-  
    ing it up for the crowd to see, he put it in a red leather bag, covered  
    it with Raleigh's wrought velvet gown, and despatched it in a  
    mourning coach sent by Lady Raleigh. Finally both head and body  
    were buried by her in St. Margaret's Church, Westminster.
    
    C. P. V. Akrigg
    
    374 DESCRIPTION AND NARRATION
    
    Akrigg states his point in the opening paragraph: Raleigh died  
    heroically. In the story itself Raleigh's own words and actions  
    carry that theme. The writer wisely lets them speak for them-  
    selves. In effective narrative you must render scenes as you  
    want readers to see them and not labor overlong on telling  
    them why your story is significant. If you create real char-  
    acters and action, readers will gather the meaning.
  - |-
    It is not even necessary to state the point at the beginning or end of the story (though sometimes, as in the example by Akrigg, it is desirable). Edmund Wilson, for instance, does not tell us what the story of Peter Romano and Mr. Copace means: it is clear enough. Similarly the following brief narrative by Ernest Hemingway, which we saw earlier as an example of understatement, leaves its meaning for readers to infer:
    
    They shot the six cabinet ministers at half-past six in the morning against the wall of a hospital. There were pools of water in the courtyard. There were wet dead leaves on the paving of the courtyard. It rained hard. All the shutters of the hospital were nailed shut. One of the ministers was sick with typhoid. Two soldiers carried him down stairs and out into the rain. They tried to hihdup against the wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. The other five stood very quietly against the wall. Finally the officer told the soldiers it was no good trying to make him stand up. When they fired the first volley he was sitting down in the water with his head on his knees.
    
    Hemingway's story exemplifies realistic meaning. For while one can read philosophical significance into the horrifying episode, there is no evidence that Hemingway intends us to jump to any philosophy. This, he implies, is simply the way things are; the story is its own meaning.
    
    The narrative also exemplifies "objective" presentation. It concentrates on the surface of events, on what can be seen and heard. Such objectivity is not a refusal to see and convey meaning, as inexperienced readers sometimes suppose. It is rather a special way of communicating meaning.
    
    NARRATION 375
    
    It can be a very powerful way. Hemingway does not fell us that war makes men cruel. He shows us; he forces us to endure the cruelty. The meaning of his brief story is more than an idea we comprehend intellectually. It becomes a part of our axpkaepnaed-aboding a part, probably, as if we had actually been there, but nonetheless a reality experienced.
  - |-
    This is what the writer of narrative does at his or her best:
    re-create events in an intense and significant manner and thus
    deepen and extend the reader's experience of the world. Of
    course, in narrative of this rich and powerful kind we are
    entering the realm of creative literature and leaving behind
    the simpler world of exposition. Still, all narrative, whether
    literary or serving the needs of exposition, must have mean-
    ing, and that meaning must be rendered in character, action,
    and setting.
    
    Point of View and Tone in Narrative
    
    Writers are always in the stories they tell, whether that pres-
    ence is apparent or hidden. It is apparent in the first-person
    point of view told by an "I." The "I" may
    
    be the central character to whom things are happening. Or
    "I" may be an observer standing on the edge of the action
    and watching what happens to others, as de Monfort observes and reports the events at Malta but does not participate
    in them.
    
    Even though a writer narrates a personal experience, however, the "I" who tells the tale is not truly identical with the
    author who writes it. The narrative "I" is a persona, more or
    less distinct from the author. Thus "I" may be made delib-
    erately and comically ironic. Heanorous writers like
    James Thurber often exaggerate the "I" to be smarter
    and braver than the author actually is. And in literary narra-
    tive "I" is likely to be even more remote from the writer,
    often a character in his own right like Huck Finn in Twain's
    great novel.
    
    376 DESCRIPTION AND NARRATION
    
    The other point of view avoids the "I." This is the third-
    person story, told in terms of "he," "she," "they." Here the
    writer seems to disappear, hidden completely behind his char-
    acters. We know an author exists because a story implies a
    storyteller. But that presence must be guessed; one never ac-
    tually observes it.
  - |-

    Nonetheless the presence is there. Even if not explicitly
    seen as an "I," the writer exists as a voice, heard in the tone
    of the story. His words and sentence patterns imply a wide
    range of tones: irony, amusement, anger, horror, shock, dis-
    gust, delight, objective detachment.
    
    Tone is essential to the meaning of a story. The tone of
    Hemingway's paragraph, for example, seems objective, de-
    tached, reportorial on the surface. He avoids suggesting emo-
    tion or jlidy theintfetyotderrible," "cruel,"
    
    "tragic." Instead, his diction denotes the simple physical re-
    alities of the scene: "wet dead leaves," "paving," "rain,"
    "shutters," "wall," "puddle," "water," "head," "knees."
    
    The absence of emotive words actually intensifies the hor-
    ror of the scene. But the objectivity of Hemingway's style is
    more than rhetorical itriderstatement—though that—the
    trick of increasing emotion by seeming to deny it. The tone
    also presents a moral stance: a tough-minded discipline in the
    face of anguish. Men die and men kill one another, and we
    must feel the horror, feel it deeply; but we must also accept
    its inevitability and stand up to it and not be overwhelmed
    by it.
    
    Now all this is implied in Hemingway's styla—that
    the tone of his prose. It is obviously a very important part of
    what he is saying. Thus style is not merely a way of conveying
    the meaning of a story; it is a part of meaning, sometimes the
    vital part.
    
    Punctuation
    
    Introduction
    
    The Purpose of Punctuation
    
    All punctuation exists, basically, to help readers understand
    what you wish to say. Mostly marks of punctuation do this
    by signaling the grammatical or logical structure of a sentence
    (usually these are the same):
    
    In the long history of the world men have given many reasons for
    killing each other in war: envy of another people's good bottom
    land or of their herds, ambition of chiefs and kings, different reli-
    gious beliefs, high spirits, revenge. Ruth Benedict
  - |-
    The colon divides this sentence into its two principal parts:
    the introductory generalization and the list of specific rea-
    sons. The commas within the list mark each single reason. The
    period closes the total statement.
    
    Less often punctuation marks stress an important word or
    phrase:
    
    In 1291, with the capture of the last great stronghold, Acre, the
    Moslems had regained all their possessions, and the great crusades
    ended, in failure. Moris Bishop
    
    380 PUNCTUATION
    
    Bishop does not need the comma before the closing phrase
    to clarify the grammar or logic of the sentence. Its purpose is
    emphasize and to stress the phrase. (The other
    commas in the sentence, however, function in the more usual
    way, indicating grammatical and logical structure.)
    
    Finally, punctuation may mark rhythm. Listen to this sen-
    tence closing an essay on General Robert E. Lee:
    
    For he gave himself to his army, and to his country, and to his God.
    W. K. Fleming
    
    The commas separating the coordinated phrases have no
    grammatical necessity. In such coordinated series, commas
    are not usually employed with and. Here, however, the re-
    quirements of a closing phrase are that it be regular
    
    in its they come to argue the greatestify
    
    Of course, these three functions of punctuation often over-
    lap. Sometimes a comma or dash both signals grammatical
    structure and establishes emphasis. And anytime you put a
    comma into a sentence to help readers follow its grammar,
    you automatically affect emphasis and rhythm.
    
    Still, keep in mind that these different reasons for punctu-
    ation exist. Asking yourself an unspecified question like "Is
    a comma needed here?" is not very helpful. Rather you must
    ask: "Is a comma needed here to clarify the grammar (or to
    establish a particular rhythm or stress)?" About Bishop's sen-
    tence we can answer that the comma before "in failure" is not
    required by grammar but is necessary for emphasis.
    
    "Rules" of Punctuation
  - |-
    It would be nice if punctuation could be reduced to a set of clear, simple directions: always use a comma here, a semicolon there, a dash in such-and-such a place. But it cannot. Much depends, as we have just seen, on what you want to do. In fact, punctuation is a mixed bag of absolute rules, general conventions, and individual options.
    
    INTRODUCTION 381
    
    For example, a declarative sentence is closed by a period: that is an inflexible rule. On the other hand, placing a comma between coordinated independent clauses ("The sun had already set, and the air was growing chilly") is a convention and not a rule, and the convention is sometimes ignored, especially if the clauses are short and uncomplicated. And occasionally a comma or other mark is used unconventionally because a writer wants to establish an unusual stress or rhythm (like the commas in the sentences by Bishop and Fleming).
    
    But while punctuation as actually practiced by good writers may seem a melange of rule, convention, and idiosyncrasy, it does not follow that anything goes. To punctuate effectively you must learn when rules are absolute; when conventions allow you options (and, of course, what the options are); and when you may indulge in individuality without misleading the reader. Moreover, you must keep the reader in mind. Younger, less experienced readers, for instance, need more help from punctuation than older, sophisticated ones.
    
    In the discussions of the various punctuation marks that follow, we shall say—as is distinguishactual—to among rules, conventions, and unconventional but possible uses. At times the distinctions may seem a bit confusing. It is no good, however, making up easy rules about how to handle punctuation. Such directions may be clear, but they do not describe what really happens. Instead, we must look at what skillful writers actually do. To diminish some of the confusion, just remember that clarity of communication is the one simple "rule" underlying all effective punctuation.

    Remember, too, that punctuation is not something you im-
    pose upon a sentence after you have written it out. Commas,
    semicolons, and the other marks are an intimate part of gram-
    mar and style. Often mistakes in punctuation do not simply
    mean that a writer broke an arbitrary rule; rather they signify
    his or her confusion about how to construct a sentence. To
    write well, you must punctuate well; but to punctuate well,
    you must also write well.
    382 PUNCTUATION
    
    The Two Categories of Punctuation
    
    It is convenient to divide punctuation into two broad cate-
    gories: the stops and the other marks. Stops take their name
    from the fact that they correspond (though only loosely) to
    pauses and intonations in speech, vocal signals which help
    listeners follow what we say. Stops include the period, the
    question mark, the exclamation point, the colon, the semi-
    colon, the comma, and the dash. We look at these first.
    
    Then we look at the other marks. These more purely visual
    signals do not mark pauses (though on occasion some of them
    signal voice intonations). They include the apostrophe, the
    quotation mark, the hyphen, the parenthesis and bracket, the
    ellipsis, and diacritics (marks placed with a letter to indicate
    a special pronunciation). Along with these marks we consider
    capitalization and underlining (or use of italics), though, in a
    strict sense, these are not matters of punctuation.
    
    CHAPTER
    
    Stops
    
    The Period
    
    The period is called an "end stop" because it is used at the
    end of a sentence. More exactly, it closes declarative
    sentences, perception, idea, belief,
    statement, an imperative sentence, or com-
    
    mand (though these are often punctuated with an exclamation
    point).
    
    Abbreviations
    
    The period is used after many abbreviations: Mr., Mrs., Ms.,
    Dr. When such an abbreviation occurs at the end of a sen-
    tence, the period does double duty, closing the sentence as
    well as marking the abbreviation.
  - |-
    Some abbreviations do not take periods: government agencies, for instance, such as the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) or the GPO (Government Printing Office). If you are uncertain about whether a particular abbreviation requires a period, consult a dictionary or an appropriate manual of style.
    
    Not all abbreviations, incidentally, are allowable in composition. Some are perfectly acceptable: SEC, GPO, or Mr.,
    
    Mrs., Ms., Dr. (Most professors, though, do not like Prof.)
    Others are not universally accepted. For example, many teachers prefer that instead of &, i.e., etc., and e.g., you write out and, that is, and so on, for example. Colloquial, slangy abbreviations are not acceptable at all: econ and polysci are legitimate enough in conversation, but you should use the full words in composition.
    
    The Question Mark
    Direct Questions
    
    The question mark (also known as the "query" and the "interrogation point") is used after direct questions. A direct question is always marked by one or some combination of three signals: a rising intonation of the voice, an auxiliary verb inverted to a position before the subject, or an interrogative pronoun or adverb (who, what, why, when, how, and so on).
    "Qizsstoris (those answered by "yes," "no," or
    some variety of "maybe") are always signaled by a rising in-
    tonation, which may or may not be accompanied by the in-
    version of the auxiliary:
    
    You're going downtown?
    Are you going downtown?
    
    In speech the intonation alone (without the inverted verb) is
    often felt to be sletfrcikmtlymposition the auxiliary
    is generally inverted.
    
    Informational questions (those requiring in answer a state-
    ment of fact, opinion, belief) do not have the rising intonation
    and may or may not have the inversion; but they contain,
    both in speech and in writing, an appropriate interrogative
    word:
    
    Who is going downtown?
    When are you going downtown?
    
    STOPS 385
    
    Indirect Questions
  - |-
    Indirect questions do not close with a question mark but with a period. Like direct questions they demand a response, but they are expressed as declarations without the formal characteristics of a question. That is, they have no inversion, no interrogative words, and no special intonation. We can imagine, for example, a situation in which one person asks another, "Are you going downtown?" (a direct question). The person addressed does not hear and a bystander says, "He asked if you were going downtown." That is an indirect question. It requires an answer, but it is expressed as a statement and so is closed by a period, not a query.
    
    Rhetorical Questions
    
    A rhetorical question is a variety of direct question and must be closed by a question mark, no matter whether the writer intends to answer or not. (The notion that a rhetorical question does not require an answer is inaccurate. Rhetorical questions are often asked precisely so that the writer can compose the answer. And even when the writer does not state the answer, he or she expects the reader to supply it.)
    
    Question Marks Within the Sentence
    
    While question marks are primarily end stops, within the sentence they may signal doubt or uncertainty concerning a particular fact, idea, or feeling:
    
    It was the Lord who knew of the impossibility every parent in that room faced: how to prepare the child for the day when the child would be despised and how to create within—by an antidote to this poison than one had found for oneself. James Baldwin
    
    386 PUNCTUATION
    
    Occasionally a question mark in parentheses appears within a sentence after a word to indicate that the writer is uncertain either of the spelling of the word or of the accuracy of the idea. One does this only when no reasonable way exists of checking the spelling or the information. It is abusing a privilege to write: "In 1492 (?) when Columbus discovered America...." Anyone not sure of that date can fairly be expected to look it up.
  - |-
    There is, finally, a problem connected with where a query  
    must be placed relative to a closing quotation mark. But since  
    the problem affects all the other stops as well, we treat it when  
    we discuss the quotation mark in the next chapter.
    
    The Exclamation Point
    
    Exclamation points convey emphasis. Most often they close  
    a sentence and signal the importance of the total statement.  
    Used after imperative statements ("Come here!"), they sug-  
    gest the tone of voice in which such a command would be  
    spoken.
    
    Even more frequently than queries, exclamation points are  
    set within a sentence in order to stress the preceding word or  
    phrase:
    
    Worse yet, he must andepplitidey often!—poverty  
    Ralph Waldo Emerson
    
    Interjections are usually followed by exclamation points:  
    Bah! you expect me to believe that?
    
    As a device of emphasis the exclamation point is of limited  
    value. Used very occasionally, it can be effective. But like  
    most mechanical means of emphasis, it quickly loses force. It  
    is far better to achieve stress by effective diction and sentence  
    structure.

    The Colon
    
    The udlhntheakemgicolon, the comma, and the  
    dashintasnal stop. That is, it is used only inside a sen-  
    tence, never at its end.
    In modern writing the most common function of the colon  
    is to introduce a specification:
    
    The first principle from which he [Hitler] started was a value judg-  
    ment: the masses are utterly contemptible. Aldous Huxley
    
    Except for the size of the houses, which varies from tiny to small,  
    the houses look like suburban housing for middle income families  
    in any section of the country: flat, low, lots of wasted space, nothing  
    in the design to please the eye or relieve the monotony.
  - |-
    Sharon R. Curtin
    
    In both these sentences the first portion expresses a general
    idea (Hitler's "first principle"; "suburban housing for middle
    income families"). The second portion, introduced by a co-
    lon, particularizes the idea.
    
    Sometimes the specification takes the form of a list or series:
    
    388 PUNCTUATION
    
    There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.
    
    Benjamin Disraeli
    
    Occasionally the usual order is reversed, and the sentence be-
    gins with the specific word or phrase, which is followed by a
    colon:
    
    Centering: that act which precedes all others on the potter's wheel.
    Mary Caroline Richards
    
    But usually the specific follows the general. Such construc-
    tions are emphatic. The kpgcpfutation—the — point—is
    at the end of the sentence. The effect of the colon, which
    represents a relatively long pause, is to prepare us for some-
    thing momentous. The emphasis is seen very clearly in these
    cases:
    
    A once-defeated demagogue trying for a comeback, he tried what
    other demagogues abroad had found a useful instrument: terror.
    Wallace Stegner
    
    Finally, last point about the man: he is in trouble.
    Benjamin DeMott
    
    What distinguishes a black hole from a planet or an ordinary star
    is that anything falling into it cannot come out of it again. If light
    cannot escape, nothing else can and it is a perfect trap: a turnstile
    to oblivion. Nigel Calder
    
    Notice in all these examples that it is not necessary that the
    construction following the colon be a complete clause. It can
    be a phrase or even a single word.
    
    Colons are also used to introduce quotations (really a kind
    of specification), especially long, written ones:
    
    A master expositor, KV.Clifford, said of an acquaintance: "He is

    The Semicolon
    
    The semicolon has two functions: to separate independent clauses and, under certain conditions, to distinguish the items in a list or series. The first function is by far the more common.
    
    Semicolon Between Independent Clauses
    Independent clauses may be joined either by coordination or by parataxis. In the first case they are linked by a coordinating conjunction (and, but, for, or, nor, yet, either...nor, neither...nor, etc.) which is usually preceded by a comma. In the second they are simply run together with no conjunctive word but are separated by a stop, conventionally a semicolon:
    
    Sentimentality and repression have a natural affinity; they're the two sides of one counterfeit coin. Pauline Kael
    
    390 PUNCTUATION
    
    Paratactic compound sentences punctuated with semicolons are especially common when the second clause repeats the first:
    
    The New Deal was a new beginning; it was a new era of American government. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.
    
    Wendell Willkie was publicly and privately the same man; he was himself. Roscoe Drummond
    
    All of these [esvoontersentd athk- white—toiled gree of thfyeadompound servants for greater or lesser terms. Oscar Handlin
    
    Using and in such sentences would be subtly misleading, implying a change of thought where none in fact exists.
    
    Parataxis is also effective between clauses expressing a sharp contrast of idea:
    
    Languages are not invented; they grow with our need for expression. Susanne K. Langer
    
    He [President Calvin Coolidge] knew precisely what the law was; he did not concern himself with what the law ought to be. Irving Stone

    Groups are capable of being as moral and intelligent as the indi-
    viduals who form them; a crowd is chaotic, has no purpose of its
    own and is capable of anything except intelligent action and real-
    istic thinking. Aldous Huxley
    
    Clauses like these could be joined by a comma and but. Omit-
    ting the conjunction and using a semicolon, however, makes
    a stronger statement, forcing readers to see the contrast for
    themselves.
    
    Occasionally even coordinated clauses are separated by a
    semicolon. This is done at the discretion of the writer and is
    more common when the clauses are relatively long and com-
    plicated, containing commas within themselves. In that case
    a semicolon more clearly signals the break between them. The
    following sentence is an example (the Duke of Wellington is
    commenting with pleasant cynicism upon the capacity of
    young ladies to endure the absence of lovers gone to war):
    
    They contrive, in some manner, to live, and look tolerably well,
    notwithstanding their despair and the continued absence of their
    lover; and some have even been known to recover so far as to be
    inclined to take another lover, if the absence of the first has lasted
    too long.
    
    Even when the coordinated clauses are not very long, a
    semicolon may still replace the more conventional comma if
    the writer wants a pigrsfigéanemphasis or rhythm:
    
    Children played about her; and she sang as she worked.
    Rupert Brooke
    
    So the silence appeared like Death; and now she had death in her
    heart. Ford Madox Ford
    
    Run-on Sentences
    
    A run-on sentence occurs when a semicolon has been omitted
    between uncoordinated independent clauses. Sometimes a
    comma is used instead (when it is, the error is often called a
    "comma fault"):
    
    INCORRECT It was late, we went home.'
    
    And sometimes the clauses are simply run together with no
    stop of any kind:
    
    INCORRECT It was late we went home.
    
    The most frequent cause of run-on sentences is mistaking
    the function of conjunctive adbrekbas+euchver,
    
    1. Commas are sometimes effective in such cases, the so-called comma link.
    Comma links are discussed on pages 286-87.

    hand, for example. These adverbs do not join clauses grammatically; they only show a relationship between the ideas in the clauses. In this they differ from coordinating conjunctions, which traditionally designate both a grammatical and a logical connection.
    
    The difference may seem arbitrary. The coordinating conjunction but and the conjunctive adverb however, for instance, can be used almost interchangeably between appropriate clauses. Even so, the first is a conjunction and needs only a comma (or maybe even no stop at all); the second is an adverb and, when it is unaccompanied by a conjunction, requires a semicolon:
    
    It was not late, but we went home.
    It was not late; however, we went home.
    
    It would result in a run-on sentence to punctuate it like this:
    INCORRECT It was late, however, we went home.
    
    Run-on sentences may be corrected in several ways, though for any given case one way will probably be best. The simplest solution is to put a semicolon in the proper place. Or the clauses may be joined by an appropriate coordinating conjunction accompanied by a comma (though this stop may be omitted if the clauses are short and simple). Or the two clauses may be recast as two sentences. Finally, the clauses may be kept as parts of the same sentence with one being subordinated to the other, in which case a comma may or may not be needed between them. Thus the run-on sentence "The search was fruitless, the men were discouraged" can be corrected:
    
    The search was fruitless; the men discouraged.
    The search was fruitless; and the men were discouraged.
    The search was fruitless. The men were discouraged.
    Because the search was fruitless the men were discouraged.
    
    Semicolons in Lists and Series
    
    Semicolons are conventionally used to separate all the items in a list or series when any of the items contains a comma. This is done because the presence of a comma within one or more items requires a stronger stop to signal the distinction between one unit in the series and another. Look at this sentence about the rise of the Ku Klux Klan:
  - |-
    There were other factors too: the deadly tedium of small-town life, where any change was a relief; the nature of current Protestant theology, rooted in Fundamentalism and hot with bigotry; and, not least, a native American moralistic blood lust that is half historical determinism, and half Freud. Robert Coughlan
    
    Even when a comma occurs in only one item, consistency requires that semicolons be used between all the elements of the series:
    
    He [Huey Long] damned and insulted Bigness in all its Louisiana manifestations: Standard Oil, the state's dominant and frequently domineering industry; the big corporations; the corporation lawyers. Hodding Carter
    
    Semicolon with Subordinate Clause
    
    Now and then a semicolon separates a main clause and a subordinate one, a job conventionally assigned to the comma. The stronger semicolon is helpful when the clauses contain internal commas; it more clearly signals the break between the clauses and helps the reader to follow the grammar:
    
    He [the white policeman) moves through Harlem, therefore, like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country; which is precisely what, and where, he is, and is the reason he walks in twos and threes. James Baldwin
    
    SEMICOLON

    B. Coordinated: comma is conventional

    Semicolon between all items when any item contains a comma
    
    The Comma
    
    The comma is the most frequent and the most complicated of all marks of punctuation. It is least reducible to rule and most subject to variation, depending on the need to be clear or emphatic, the preferences of individual writers, and even fashion.
    
    [> Coordinated Independent Clauses
    
    Coordinated elements are grammatically identical constructions in the same sentence joined by a coordinating conjunction (and, but, for, or, nor, and the correlatives either... neither, both ... and, not but). Any part of a
    
    sentence may be coordinated: two subjects, two verbs, two objects, two adjectivals, two adverbials, two independent clauses.
  - |-
    As a very general rule, two coordinated independent clauses are punctuated with a comma; lesser elements, such as words, phrases, and dependent clauses, are not so punctuated. But exceptions occur, depending on the length and complexity of the constructions. Let's look at several examples.
    
    Two coordinated independent clauses are usually separated by a comma, placed immediately before the conjunction:
    
    STOPS 395
    
    It [history] is a story that cannot be told in dry lines, and its meaning cannot be conveyed in a species of geometry. Herbert Butterfield
    
    When such coordinated clauses are complicated and contain internal commas, the stronger semicolon may be used to separate them, as we saw on page 282. On the other hand when they are short, obviously related, and contain no internal commas, the comma between them may be omitted:
    
    They tried to hold him up against the wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. Emest Hemingway
    
    The Comma Link
    
    A comma link is a comma used between independent clauses that are paratactically joined by one of the coordinating conjunctions but simply run together. The semicolon is the conventional mark in such a construction (see pages 282-83), and employing a comma is generally regarded as a fault. Under certain circumstances, however, a comma may be used between paratactic clauses (though it is never obligatory). The clauses must be short and simple and contain no internal stops; the relationship of ideas should be immediately clear; and the sentences should move rapidly with only light pauses:
    
    A memoir is history, it is based on evidence. E. M. Forster
    
    The crisis was past, the prospects were favorable. Samuel Hopkins Adams
    
    When three or more such short, obviously related independent clauses are joined paratactically, comma links are even more frequent:
    
    Some of the people said that the elephant had gone in one direction, some said that he had gone in another, some professed not even to have heard of any elephant. George Orwell

    He becomes more callous, the population becomes more hostile,
    the situation grows more tense, and the police force is increased.
    James Baldwin
    
    The last sentence (about racial tensions in Harlem between
    white policemen and black residents) illustrates the particular
    advantage of comma links. By allowing rapid movement from
    clause to clause, the punctuation reinforces our sense of the
    inevitability of social cause and effect.
    
    Easy rules about when a comma link is effective and when
    it is a comma fault do not exist. Certainly long, complicated
    paratactic independent clauses (especially those containing
    commas) ought to be punctuated by semicolons, not commas.
    And even when the clauses are not particularly long and con-
    tain no commas within themselves, the relationships among
    ideas may not be sufficiently close and obvious to allow a
    comma link. In this sentence, for instance, a semicolon would
    be clearer:
    
    INCORRECT We are overloaded with garbage, in fact we have so
    much excess garbage that it is being used to make hills to ski on.
    
    For the inexperienced writer the safest course is to use a semi-
    colon between uncoordinated independent clauses unless he
    or she is very sure that a comma will help the rhythm of the
    sentence and will not confuse the reader.
    
    As the foregoing discussion suggests, the punctuation of
    independent clauses is not easily explained in a simple rule.
    Current practice is summed up in the following table:
    
    PUNCTUATION OF INDEPENDENT CLAUSES
    
    |.When coordinated:
    A. Conventional punctuation: comma
    STOPS 397

    a pause is not desirable
    ll. When paratactic:
    A. Conventional punctuation: semicolon
    B. Optional punctuation: comma
    If the clauses are short, clearly related, contain no commas,
    and fast movement is desirable
    
    [> The Comma with Coordinated Elements
    Other Than Independent Clauses
    
    Two coordinated subjects, verbs, objects, or modifiers are not
    usually punctuated:
    
    Jack and Jill went up the hill.
    NOT Jack, and Jill went up the hill.
    
    We saw them and were surprised.
    NOT We saw them, and were surprised.

    However, commas may be helpful in the members
    of such coordinated pairs when the first is long or when the
    writer wants a pause for emphasis. Thus in the following sen-
    tence the comma helps the reader to distinguish the two long
    predicates that follow the subject ("the twentieth century"):

    place, and demands something more mystic. George Bemard Shaw

    In the next examples the comma separating two coordi-
    nated verbs (while not necessary because of their length) gives
    the idea more emphasis:
    
    We turned to them, and paused.
    
    At night we were stained by dew, and shamed into pettiness by the
    innumerable silences of stars. T. E. Lawrence
    
    [> The Comma with Lists and Series
    
    A list or series consists of three or more grammatically parallel
    words or constructions such as three of four subjects of the
    same verb, say, or three verbs of the same subject, or four or
    five adjectives modifying the same noun.
    
    The items in a list, or series, may be joined by coordinating
    conjunctions ("She bought bread and eggs and cheese") or
    by parataxis ("She bought bread, eggs, cheese"). The most
    common method is to combine parataxis and coordination,
    linking the last two items with and, or, or but not, and joining
    the others paratactically: "She bought bread, eggs, and
    cheese."
    
    When a list or series is completely paratactic, commas are
    used between the items:
    
    Oriental luxury goods, jade, silk, gold, spices, vermilion, jewels,
    had formerly come overland by way of the Caspian Sea. . ..
    Robert Craves
    
    When it is completely coordinated, the commas are usually
    omitted:
    
    She was crying now because she remembered that her life had been
    a long succession of humiliations and mistakes and pains and ri-
    diculous efforts. Rrys jean
    
    In the combined method (the most frequent practice), a
    comma goes between each pair of paratactic elements and is

    optional between the final coordinated pair, the choice de-
    pending on the preference of the writer or the policy of an
    editor. The first of these examples uses the comma; the second
    does not:

    men was required to print, fold, and arrange in piles the signatures
    of a book. Carl Becker
    
    His plan was to clinch his teeth, shut his eyes, whirl the club round
    his head and bring it down with sickening violence in the general
    direction of the sphere. p. G. Wodehouse
    
    But whether you choose to place a comma between the
    final coordinated items or to leave it out, you should follow
    the same practice consistently in any piece of writing.
    
    Finally about lists and series, remember that semicolons are
    conventionally used between all items when any item contains
    a comma within itself.

    >The Comma with Adjectivals
    
    An adjectival is a word, phrase, or clause functioning as an
    adjective.
    
    400 PUNCTUATION
    
    Single-Word Adjectives
    
    Most single-word adjectives are reset inteatthat
    
    to the meaning of the nouns they modify. A restrictive adjec-
    tive is placed after the noun marker, if there is one (a, an the,
    some, this, any, and so on), and is not punctuated (italics
    added in the following examples):
    
    The angry man sat down abruptly.
    
    However, adjectives are often used in a rather different
    sense, being either placed before the noun marker (when one
    is present) and followed by a comma, or after the noun and
    set off by commas:
    
    Angry, the man sat down.
    The man, angry, sat down.

    They may even be pushed to the end of the clause and pre-
    ceded by a comma:
    
    The man sat down, angry.
    
    In such patterns (especially common with participles acting
    as adjectives), the word really functions more like an adverb.
    It tells us something about the action (in this case, how or
    why the man sat down) rather than about the noun (the man
    himself). Such "adjectives" are punctuated.
    
    Finally about single-word adjectives: when two or more are
    used together they are not usually punctuated if they are co-
    ordinated. However, should emphasis require it, the second
    of a pair of coordinated adjectives may be set off by commas:
    
    It [England] always had a peculiar, and a fond, relationship with
    the papacy. Paul Johnson
    
    STOPS 401
    
    When two or more adjectives are run together without con-
    junctions, they must be punctuated for clarity:
    
    A novel is in its broadest definition a personal, a direct impression
    of life... . Henry James
    
    Participial Adjectival Phrases
    Used restrictively, participial phrases follow the noun and are
    not preceded by a comma:
    
    A man leading a horse was walking inland from the sea.
    W. S. Merwin
    
    Often, however, participial phrases function nonrestric-
    tively. They supply pertinent information about the noun
    they modify, but not information essential to understanding
    its meaning in the sentence. Nonrestrictive participles are al-
    ways punctuated. They may precede their noun; follow it,
    introduced between it and the verb or remainder of the clause;
    or be postponed to the end of the clause. In any case they
    must be followed, set off, or preceded by commas:
    
    Born to lowly circumstances, he came up the easy way.
    Samuel Hopkins Adams
    
    Words, being but symbols by which a man expresses his ideas, are

    Adjectival Clauses
  - |-
    Adjectival clauses are less flexible in their positioning than the
    participial phrase: they must follow their noun. But they too
    may be either restrictive or nonrestrictive, and they are punc-
    tuated accordingly. Restrictive clauses are not punctuated;
    nonrestrictive ones are set off by commas when they fall
    402 PUNCTUATION
    
    inside the main clause, preceded by commas when they fall
    at the end:

    publican, stood the Emperor Augustus. Robert Graves
    
    All images are symbols, which make us think about the things they
    mean. Susanne K. Langer
    
    Nonrestrictive clauses are sometimes used in a loose sense,
    to modify not a single noun but an entire idea. Such clauses
    are introduced by which, placed at the end of the sentence or
    clause they modify, and always preceded by a comma:
    
    Lenin was cruel, which Gladstone was not. ... Bertrand Russell

    STOPS 403
    
    > The Comma with Adverbials
  - |-
    An adverbial is any word or construction used as an adverb.
    Adverbials are more flexible in their positioning than adjec-
    tives, modify more kinds of words, and convey a wider range
    of meanings. Consequently their punctuation is especially
    variable. In the discussion that follows, advice about using
    commas with adverbials must be understood as loose gener-
    alizations, which skillful writers frequently ignore or adapt to
    their particular need to be emphatic or clear or rhythmic.
    
    Single-Word Adverbs
    When simple adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other ad-
    verbs, they are not usually punctuated (italics are added in the
    following examples):
    
    He wept quietly.
    The people were extremely happy.
    Everyone was very deeply concerned.
    
    Sentence adverbs (those that modify an entire clause rather
    than any single word) are more frequently punctuated. In
    composition, sentence adverbs often take the form of con-
    nectives, qualifiers, and what may be called "attitudinals"
    (words like fortunately or unhappily that express a writer's
    attitude toward the statement he or she is making). Mostly
    such words are punctuated, whether in the opening, inter-
    rupting, or closing position (italics added):
    
    Further, Hamlet's world is a world of riddles. Maynard Mack
    
    Unhappily, the gibe has point. Brand Blanshard
    
    In spite of all these dissimilarities, however, the points of resem-
    blance were quite as profound. Bertrand Russell
    
    But, /uckily, even at the dreariest moments of our pilgrimage there
    were compensations. Huxley Aldous
    
    I missed that class, fortunately. Student
    
    404 PUNCTUATION
    
    There is, however, considerable variation in punctuating
    such sentence adverbs. Some (However, for example) are al-
    ways punctuated. With others (therefore, luckily, fortunately)
    the punctuation is used than not—
    may be omitted if the writer does not like the pause and feels
    that clarity does not require it.
    
    When the coordinating conjunctions and, but, for, or are
    used to introduce a sentence, they are not punctuated, even
    though they are acting, for all intents and purposes, as con-
    junctive adverbs:
  - |-
    But we stayed.
    NOT But, we stayed.
    
    Adverbial Prepositional Phrases
    
    In the first position, when they open a sentence, adverbial
    prepositional phrases may or may not be punctuated. Much
    depends on the conventions regarding ppeaskes, on the
    writer's own preference, and on the need for clarity or em-
    phasis. Some idiomatic phrases are usually followed by com-
    mas; this is especially the case with those acting as sentence
    adverbs signaling logical relationship or attitude (for example,
    on the other hand, of course):
    
    For example, in ft#té was produced in Great Britain seven
    billion yards of cotton cloth for export alone. Carl Becker
    
    Less formulaic phrases are often punctuated or not, ac-
    cording to the writer's sense of rhythm:
    
    lm crude way, Mickey Spillane is something of an innovator.
    Charles J. Rolo
    
    Of Pushkin's shorter stories The Queen of Spades is perhaps the
    most entertaining. Rosemary Edmonds
    
    However, if there is any chance that an initial phrase may
    be misconnected, a comma should always be used. These two
    sentences, for instance, would be clearer with commas:
    
    STOPS 405
    In writing these signals must be replaced by punctuation.
    
    In business machines are built to become obsolete within a few
    years.
    
    In each case the object of the preposition can be misread as
    grammatically tied to the following word, as if the writers
    were talking about "writing these signals" and "business
    machines."
    
    Within a sentence adverbial phrases are punctuated with
    great variability. What the phrase mbelifisjs placed,
    what rhythm or emphasis the writer wants are all important.
    A key consideration is whether or not the phrase is felt as an
    inteasupterdithanto the normal grammatical
    flow of the sentence. If it is, set off the phrase by commas.
    Interrupting phrases often come between subject and verb:
    
    Jerusalem, of course, contains more than ghosts and architectural
    monstrosities. Aldous Huxley
    
    Barrett Wendell, in his admirable book on writing, points out that
    clearness and vividness often turn on mere specificity.
    Brand Blanshard
    
    But they may come elsewhere:
    
    And their former masters were, from the start, resolved to maintain
    the old difference. Oscar Handlin
  - |-
    Coughlin's activities were clearly, after Pearl Harbor, intolerable.
    Wallace Stegner
    
    Newspapermen have always felt superstitious, among other things,
    about Lindbergh. John Lardner
    
    In such cases the writer is seeking clarity or emphasis. The
    option is not so much whether to punctuate the phrase as
    where to place it. Any of the phrases in the three examples
    above could be positioned, and more idiomatically, at the end
    406 PUNCTUATION
    
    and would then probably not need commas. But placed where
    they are, they do require punctuation.
    
    At the close of a sentence or clause, adverbial phrases are
    not generally punctuated:
    
    The party adjourned to the kitchen.... Herbert Asbury
    
    He was quiet and in-dwelling from early boyhood on.
    John Lardner
    
    Final adverbial phrases may be isolated for emphasis,
    though the technique quickly loses value if overworked:
    
    They were not men of equal status, despite the professed demo-
    cratic procedure. Hany Hansen
    
    And why is this picture an absuroliqouras ?
    George Orwell
    
    Adverbial Clauses
    In initial pdsemothey precede the main clause, adver-
    bial clauses are usually punctuated:
    
    Iwe figure out the answer, we feel devilishly smart; if we dont,
    we enjoy a juicy surprise. Charles J. Rolo
    
    When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer.
    George Orwell
    
    A writer has the option of omitting the comma afthort
    initial adverbial clause if clarity will not suffer. (British writers
    seem to exercise that choice more often than do Americans):
    
    When he describes the pastthe historian has to recapture the rich-
    ness of the moments, ... Herbert Butterfield
    
    However, the comma should never be left out if there is any
    possibility that readers will see an unintended grammatical
    connection between the last word of the adverbial clause and
    STOPS 407
    
    the first word of the following construction. In the sentence
    below, for instance, a comma after "sail" would prevent read-
    ers from the misstep of thinking the writer is referring to "sail
    boats":
    
    When you are first learning to sail boats seem to be very cumber-
    some things.
    
    Adverbial clauses in an interrupting position are conven-
    tionally punctuated:
  - |-
    The whole thing, as he himself recognized, was a clean sporting
    venture. P. C. Wodehouse
    
    On occasion, if no operations were scheduled for the next day, he
    would be up early and out on an all-day hunt after getting only one
    or two hours of sleep. Ralph K. Andrist
    
    Adverbial clauses in the dosing position may or may not be
    punctuated. The primary considerations are clarity and
    rhythm. A comma generally helps readers follow the gram-
    mar, especially before clauses expressing a concession or qual-
    ification:
    
    The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, although the judges
    could not agree on any one opinion. Roger Fisher
    
    Now seldom cuss, although at first was quick to open fire at
    everything that tried my patience. Richard E. Byrd
    
    On the other hand, some writers prefer to omit the comma
    when the main and the adverbial clauses are both short and
    unpunctuated within themselves. The comma is often omitted
    before because if the pause might seem overly emphatic:
    
    Locke thought traditional theology worthless because it was not
    primarily concerned with — truth. Paul Johnson
    
    408 PUNCTUATION
    
    On one occasion, however, a following because-clause
    should be preceded by a comma. This is when it comes after
    a negative statement and is intended as a straightforward ex-
    planation of that statement:
    
    They did not elect him, because they distrusted him.
    
    Without the comma such a sentence may be read as an ironic
    assertion that "they did elect him and certainly did not dis-
    trust him."
    
    COMMA WITH ADVERBIALS

    Foréupetad, lett.

    > Comma with the Main Elements of the
    Sentence
    
    The main elements of a sentence are the subject and object, separated by commas except under unusual conditions. Very occasionally when the subject is not a single word but a long construction, such as a noun clause, a comma may be put at its end to signal the verb (italics are added in the following examples):
    
    What makes the generation of the ‘60s different, is that it is largely
    inner-directed and uncontrolled by adult-doyens. magadinge
    
    In such a sentence the comma between the subject and the
    verb may help readers to follow the grammar.
    
    Commas may also be used with the main elements in the
    case of inversion, where subject, verb, and object
    are arranged in something other than their usual order. Some-
    times the pattern is object, subject, verb; if the object is a long
    construction, a comma may be set between it and the subject:
    
    What he actually meant by it, cannot imagine. Aldous Huxley

    with the idiom "I think" ("I suppose," "I imagine," "I hope"
    are other variations):
    
    410 PUNCTUATION
    
    The lectures, / understand, are given and may even be taken.
    Stephen Leacock
    
    Lenin, on the contrary, might, / think, have seemed to me at once
    a narrow-minded fanatic and a cheap cynic. Bertrand Russell
    
    In this type of sentence the main subject/verb is the "I think,"
    "IT understand." The rest (which contains the key idea) is a
    contact clause acting as the direct object, telling us what is
    understood or thought. If the sentence were in straightfor-
    ward order, no comma would be necessary between the main
    elements:
    
    lunderstand the lectures are given.. ..
    {think Lenin might have seemed....
    
    But when the "I understand" or "I think" is intruded within
    the noun clause, the subject/verb must be treated as an inter-
    rupting construction and set off by commas.
    
    > Comma with Appositives
    
    An appositive is a word or construction which refers to the
    same thing as another and is (usually) set immediately after
    it. When appositives are restrictive, they are not punctuated:
    
    The argument that the corporations create new psychological needs
    in order to sell their wares is equally flimsy. Ellen Willis
    
    In that sentence the clause is in restrictive apposition to the
    subject "argument"; it Spegifraent," and the noun
    would be relatively meaningless without it. Notice that the
    clause is not set off by commas. (Sometimes, however, a
    comma is placed after such a olause—though — before—to
    mark its end and signal a new construction.)
    
    Often appositives are nonrestrictive. In that case they must
    be punctuated. Usually such appositives follow the noun and
    
    STOPS 4ll
    
    should be preceded by a comma (and followed by one if they
    do not close the sentence):
    
    Poskitt, the dfArtagnag, was a man who brought to the
    tee the tactics which in his youth had won him such fame as a
    hammer thrower. p. G. Wodehouse
    
    The newcomers were pagans, worshippers of Wotather Teu-
    tonic gods. Margaret Schlauch
  - |-
    She was a splendid woman, this Mayen. W. Lews H.
    
    Appositives occasionally open a clause or sentence, thus
    preceding the word to which they are in apposition. Then
    they must be followed by a comma, as in this example where
    a series of three appositives precedes the subject ("Bishop An-
    drewes''):
    
    A gifted preacher, a profound scholar, and a great and good man,
    Bishop Andrewes was one of the lights of the Church of England.
    G. P. V. Akrigg
    
    [> Comma with Absolutes
    
    An absolute is a construction that is included within a sen-
    tence but is not really a grammatical part of that sentence; it
    serves as a kind of loose clausal modifier.
    
    Nominative absolutes, the most common kind in compo-
    sition, may precede, follow, or be intruded into the main
    clause. In all cases they are punctuated (the absolutes are ital-
    icized in the following examples):
    
    The savings of the nation having been absorbed by Wall Street, the
    people were persuaded to borrow money on their farms, factories,
    homes, machinery, and every other tangible asset that they might
    earn high interest rates and take big profits out of the rise in the
    market. Irving Stone

    me with a politeness clearly on the inner edge of neurosis.

    Participial and infinitive absolutes are also punctuated:
    
    Allowing for hyperbole and halving the figure, that is still one hell
    of a pile of pulp. Pauline Kael
    
    To revert for a moment to the story told in the first person, it is plain
    that in that case the narrator has no such liberty... .
    Percy Lubbock
    
    [> Comma with Suspended Constructions
  - |-
    A suspended construction occurs when two or more units are hooked grammatically to the same thing. It is really a form of parallelism, but an unusual or emphatic form, which readers may find difficult. Hence such constructions are often (though not invariably) punctuated:
    
    Many people believed, and still do, that he was taking Nazi money to run his machine. Wallace Stegner
    
    Prescott and Parkman were willing, and Motley reluctant, to concede that the sixteenth-century Spaniard's desire to convert American Indians had not been hypocritical. David Levin
    
    When the idiomatic phrase more or less is treated as a suspended construction, it always requires commas to distinguish it from its more common meaning. Usually more or less signifies a qualified affirmation, and then is not punctuated:
    
    He was more or less interested. = He was mildly interested.
    
    STOPS 413
    
    But when more or less is used in a strict disjunctive sense— that is, to mean either more or less, but not both — it is set off by commas:
    
    It is hard to say whether the payment for votes has become more, less, important. Ronald P. Dore
    
    > Comma with Dates and Place-names
    
    In American usage, dates are conventionally punctuated like this:
    
    April 14, 1926
    April 1926
    
    In European usage the day precedes the month, in which case a comma is unnecessary:
    
    14 April 1926
    
    In those place-names that consist of both a local and larger designation (state, region, province, nation), a comma is placed between the two:
    
    London, Ontario
    Kittery Point, Maine
    
    The Dash
    
    The dash ought not to be confused with the hyphen. It is a longer mark, and on a typewriter is made either by two hyphens (—) or by a single hyphen with a space on either side (-).
    
    The dash has no function that is uniquely its own. Instead it acts as a strong comma and as a less formal equivalent to the semicolon, the colon, and the parenthesis. As a substitute for the comma, the dash signals a stronger, more significant
  - |-
    pause. For that reason it should be used spaerngly,
    for occasions when emphasis is really needed.
    
    > The Dash Isolating Final Constructions
    
    Dashes force an emphatic pause before the last word or phrase
    of a sentence:
    
    Our time is one of disillusion in our species and a resulting lack of
    selfecbnfence!+éasons. Barbara Tuchman
    
    So the gift of symbolism, which is the gift of reason, is at the same
    time the seat of man's peculiar deraleressuthany.
    
    Susanne K. Langer
    
    [> The Dash Around Interrupting Phrases
    and Dependent Clauses
    
    Dashes may set off dependent interrupting constructions such
    as nonrestrictive adjective clauses, adverbial phrases and
    clauses, appositives, and suspended constructions. In such a
    use, they create emphasis.

    Notice, in the last example, that dashes are clearer signals
    of the grammar than commas would be, since the interrupting
    series contains commas.
    
    > The Dash with Coordinated Elements
    
    As we saw with the comma (page 288), coordinated elements
    are sometimes punctuated for emphasis. Stronger stress can
    be attained by using dashes:
    
    We weredegncoatectimith these invisible
    empires. Arnold Thurman

    Coordinated independent clauses are occasionally separated by a dash instead of the usual comma, but it is worth
    repeating that the dash is not the conventional stop for such
    a case and should be employed only when emphasis is nec-
    essary:
    
    He was a sad, embittered young melh-heaandght be.
    Alidotesy
    
    Even uncoordinated independent clauses may be punctu-
    ated by a dash instead of the conventional semicolon:

    [> The Dash Introducing a List
    
    The colon conventionally introduces a series of specifics. The
    dash, however, is employed for the same purpose. The only
    difference is that the dash is less formal:
    
    Ishort, says the historian Friedrich thkl@eysades were pro-
    moted with all the devices of the gtjsagandist—atrocity
    over-simplification, lies, inflammatory speeches. Mons Bishop
    
    [> The Dash Around Intrusive Sentence
    Absolutes
    
    An intrusive sentence absolute is a completely independent
    second sentence which is stuck into the middle of a containing
    statement without being syntactically tied to it in any way.
    Such a construction must be clearly marked, but it cannot be
    set off by commas, semicolons, or colons, since these stops
    would imply a grammatical connection between it and the
    containing sentence which does not exist. Parentheses could
    be used and sometimes are; but they are a little formal for this
    kind of construction, which is colloquial in tone. Here, then,
    is the one function which belongs primarily to the dash:
    
    The opening jsacngrapihPushkin's famous openings—

    The Other Marks  
    
    In addition to the stops, punctuation marks include the apos-  
    trophe, the quotation mark, the hyphen, the ellipsis, the pa-  
    renthesis and bracket, and the diacritics. We look at these  
    here, along with the related matters of capitalization and  
    underlining.  
    
    The Apostrophe  
    
    The apostrophe has three main functions: it marks the pos-  
    sessive form of nouns and some pronouns, the contraction of  
    two words, and the omission of sound within a word. It also  
    appears in the plurals of certain abbreviations.  
    
    [> Apostrophe to Show Possession  
    
    Common Nouns  
    In their singular form common nouns that do not end in -s  
    or another sibilant add -'s to show possession:  
    
    the cat's bowl, the girl's hat, the boy's jacket  
    
    Singular nouns with a final sibilant also generally add  
    the -''s in modern convention:  
    418 PUNCTUATION  
    the horse's tail, the apprentice's job  
    
    However, there is a minor variation of usage in this matter.  
    If such a word has several syllables and the final one is un-  
    stressed, some writers and editors prefer to drop the -s, using  
    the apostrophe alone to indicate possession:  
    
    for appearance's sake OR for appearance' sake  
    
    The issue can often be dodged by using an of-phrase:  
    
    for the sake of appearance  
    
    Plural nouns ending in -s (the vast majority) add only an apos-
  - |-
    the girls' books, the mechanics' toolboxes  
    Those which do not end in -s and -'S:  
    the men's books, the children's toys  
    Proper Nouns  
    Proper nouns that do not have a final sibilant follow the same  
    rule as common nouns:  
    Sarah's house, Eisenhower's career  
    With proper nouns ending in sibilants, practice varies.  
    If the noun is monosyllabic, it is conventional to add the  
    full ~'s:  
    Henry James's novels, John Keats's poetry  
    But opinion differs when proper names have more than a sin-  
    
    gle syllable. Some people prefer -'s, some the apostrophe  
    alone:  
    Reynold's paintings OR Reynolds' paintings  
    
    However, the -s should be omitted from the possessive of  
    names containing several syllables if it would result in an awk-  
    
    ward combination of sounds:  
    
    Jesus' ministry NOT Jeses's  
    Xerxes' army NOT Xerxes's army  
    
    When the plural form of a family name is used in the pos-  
    sessive, the apostrophe alone is called for:  
    
    the Browns' house, the Johnsons' boat  
    
    Pronouns  
    Indefinite pronouns form the possessive by adding -'s:  
    
    anyone's, anybody's, someone's, everyone's, and so on  
    
    The predicative possessive forms of the personal pronouns,  
    however, do not use an apostrophe:  
    
    mine, yours, his, hers, its, ours, theirs  
    
    Its is especially likely to be misused, probably because of con-  
    fusion with the contraction it's for it is. Never use it's for the  
    possessive of it:  
    
    The cat washed its tail.  
    NOT The cat washed it's tail.  
    
    The possessive of who is whose, not who's, which is the  
    contraction of who is.  
    
    > Apostrophe to Show Contraction  
    
    A contraction is the coming together of two or more words  
    with the omission of intervening sounds (in writing, of  
    course, the letters). Contractions are common in speech and  
    are permissible in informal writing, though they should be  
    avoided in a formal style. They are most likely with auxiliary  
    verbs and negative words, and in all cases an apostrophe  
    should be placed in the position of the deleted sound or letter:
  - |-
    He'll go. = He will go.
    We would've gone. = We would have gone.
    They won't go. #ey will not go.
    
    Notice that in the last example several sounds have been
    dropped, but only one apostrophe is used.
    
    The contracted form of the auxiliary have, incidentally,
    sounds exactly like the unstressed of. Because of this confu-
    sion such constructions as / could of gone are sometimes seen.
    That is not in accordance with formal usage and should be
    avoided. The proper form is: / could've gone.
    
    [> The Apostrophe to Mark Elision
    
    Elision is dropping a sound from a word. This often occurs
    in rapid speech £gomg)fand was sometimes done in
    
    older poetry (e'en for even, ne'er for never), though rarely in
    modern verse. An apostrophe signals when a sound is elided.
    Elision is rarely necessary in composition.
    
    [> The Apostrophe with the Plural Forms of
    Letters
    
    When letters and numerals are used in the plural, they gen-
    erally simply add -s:

    He makes his A's in an unusual way.

    The Quotation Mark
    
    Quotation marks are used with (1) direct quotations, (2) cer-
    tain titles, and (3) words given a special sense. Quote marks
    have two forms: double '().and single ('...'). Most
    American writers prefer double quotes, switching to single
    should they need to mark a quote within a quote. British
    writers are more likely to begin with single quotes, switching,
    if necessary, to double. Whether single or double, the quote
    at the beginning is called an opening quotation mark; the one
    at the end, a closing.
  - |-
    A direct quotation consists of the words actually spoken or  
    written by someone other than the writer. It is distinct from  
    an indirect quotation, which reports the substance of what  
    was said or written but changes the words to fit the context—  
    often altering pronouns and verbs:  
    
    DIRECT She said, "We are not going."  
    INDIRECT She said that they were not going.  
    
    Direct quotations must be signaled by quote marks; indirect  
    quotations must not be.  
    
    Introducing a Quotation  
    
    In introducing a quotation the subject and verb of address  
    may precede, follow, or intrude into the quoted matter. The  
    three possibilities are punctuated like this:  
    She said, "We are not going."  
    "We are not going," she said.  
    "We," she said, "are not going."  
    
    Notice that the first word of the quotation is capitalized,  
    but that when a quotation is broken, the word of the continuation  
    is not capitalized (unless, of course, it happens to be a proper noun or adjective  
    or the beginning word of a new sentence).  
    
    Written quotations may be preceded by a comma, or, more  
    formally, by a colon:  
    
    Professor Brown writes: "By themselves statistics are rarely enough;  
    they require careful interpretation."  
    
    Often written quotations are worked into the text in a  
    smoother manner by an introductory that. The that requires  
    no stop since it turns the quotation into a noun clause acting  
    as the direct object of the verb; and the first word of the  
    quotation is not capitalized:  
    
    Professor Jones writes that "by themselves statistics are rarely  
    enough; they require careful interpretation."  
    
    If a quotation is extensive and involves more than one par-  
    agraph, it is customary to repeat the opening quote marks at  
    the beginning of each new paragraph. Closing quotes are used  
    only at the end of the final paragraph.  
    
    However, extended written quotations are more com-  
    monly indented, in which case quote marks are not needed.  
    
    Quotation Marks in Relation to Stops  
    With opening quote marks, a comma, a colon, or any other  
    stop always precedes the quotation mark.  
    
    With closing quotes, however, the matter is more compli-  
    cated. In American usage, commas and periods always come  
    inside a final quote mark; semicolons and colons, outside.
  - |-
    This rule applies regardless of whether the stop in question is part of the quotation or not:
    
    She said, "We are not going."
    
    She said, "We are not going," and they didn't.
    She said, "We are not going"; they didn't.
    She said, "We are not going": why, Wonder?
    
    In the case of question marks and exclamation points,
    placement depends on whether the stop applies only to the
    quotation, only to the sentence containing the quotation, or
    to both. When the quotation is a question (or exclamation)
    and the enclosing sentence is a declarative statement, the
    query (or exclamation point) comes inside the final quote
    mark:
    
    She asked, "Are we going?"
    
    When the quotation is a statement and the enclosing sen-
    tence a question, the query is placed outside:
    
    Did she say, "We are going"?
    
    When, finally, both quotation and sentence are questions,
    the query is inside the quote mark, where it does double duty:
    
    Did she ask, "Are we going?"
    
    Notice that whether it goes inside or outside the closing
    quotation, the query (or exclamation point) serves as the end
    stop; no period is necessary.
    
    > Quotation Marks with Titles
    
    Some titles of literary works are italicized (in typescript, un-
    derlined), others are placed in quote marks. The basic consid-
    eration is whether the work was published or presented
    separately or rather as part of something larger (for example,
    a magazine or collection). In the first case the title is italicized;
    
    in the second, set within quotes. In practical terms, this means
    that the titles of books, plays, and long poems, such as the
    Tale are italicized, while the titles of short stories, short po-
    ems, essays, articles in magazines or other periodicals, and the
    titles of chapters or sections within a book are quoted:
    
    Hemingway's novel A Farewell to Arms has been made into a
    movie.
    
    A Winter's Tale is one of Shakespeare's so-called problem
    comedies.
    
    "A Rose for Emily" by William Faulkner is a shocking short story.
    In Vanity Fair, Thackeray calls one chapter "How to Live on Nothing
    a Year."
    
    The finest carpe diem poem in English is Andrew Marvell's "To His
    Coy Mistress."
  - |-
    The titles of movies are italicized, those of television and  
    radio shows are quoted:
    
    *Robin and Marian* is an unusual and interesting film treatment of  
    the Robin Hood story.
    
    "Truth or Consequences" was popular both on radio and on  
    television.
    
    Notice that the first word of a title is always capitalized.  
    So are the last word and all intervening words except articles  
    (a, an, the), short prepositions, and coordinating  
    conjunctions.
    
    [> Quotation Marks to Signify Special Meaning
    
    Limited or Technical Meaning
    
    Sometimes a common word must be used in a special sense  
    that applies only within a limited context. To make the lim-  
    itation clear, it helps to put the word in quotes:

    the sense that students were accepted from everywhere, not merely  
    from the neighborhood. Moris Bishop
    
    Irony
    
    Irony is using a word in a sense very different from—often  
    opposite conventional meaning. Effective irony de-  
    
    pends on the reader's recognizing the writer's intent. Inten-  
    tion should be clear from the context. Even so, a signal is  
    sometimes advisable. In speech this is given by intonation, as  
    when we speak the word brave in a scornful way to mean  
    "cowardly." In writing, the signal may be supplied by quo-  
    tation marks:
    
    The Indians were therefore pushed back behind ever-retreating  
    frontiers. "Permanent" boundaries were established between the  
    United States and the Indians, tribes were moved out of the United  
    States and established beyond those boundaries. Again and again  
    the boundaries were violated by the whites.
    
    James Oliver Robertson
    
    Citation Terms
    
    A citation term is a word used to refer to itself rather than to  
    the object or concept or feeling it conventionally designates.  
    Usually such terms are italicized, but sometimes they are  
    quoted. (They should never be treated both ways.) The fol-  
    lowing pair of sentences illustrate the difference between the  
    same word used first in its conventional sense and second as  
    a citation term:
    
    A horse grazed in the meadow.  
    "Horse" is a citation term.
    
    Definitions  
    When a word is defined, its meaning is sometimes put in  
    quotes, the word itself being italicized:
  - |-
    Other-directed means "accepting and living by the standards of the social group to which one belongs or aspires."
    
    Slang and Colloquialisms
    
    It is not necessary to place quotation marks around slang or colloquial expressions, apologizing for them, so to speak. If the term says exactly what you want to say, no apology is needed; if it does not, no apology will help.
    
    The Hyphen
    
    The hyphen has two principal functions. It marks the syllabic division of a word between lines, and it also separates the elements of some compound words.
    
    [> The Hyphen to Indicate Division of a Word
    
    When separating a word between lines, you should always place the hyphen at the end of the upper line, never at the beginning of the new line. The word supper, for example, must be divided:
    
    sup- NOT sup
    per -per
    
    Words can be divided only between syllables. Most of us have only a hazy idea of the syllabication of many words, and it is best to consult a dictionary when you must split a word.
    
    [> The Hyphen with Compounds
    
    In certain compounds (two or more words treated as one) the hyphen separates the individual words. English does not treat compounds with much consistency. Some are printed as separate words (contact lens, drawing room, milk shake); some as single terms (famtikbatynidships); and still others are hyphenated (gun-shy, photo-offset). Some compounds are treated differently by different writers; you cannot tell how any particular compound is conventionally written without consulting a dictionary or observing how publishers print it.
    
    The examples we just saw are all conventional compound words. Another kind exists called the nonce compound. This is a construction, usually a modifier, made up for a specific occasion and not existing as a standard idiom. In the following sentence, the first compound is conventional; the other two are nonce expressions:
    
    Old-fashioned, wracetiga-lifetime, till-death-do-us-part
    Lesliédge Westoff
    
    Nonce compounds are always hyphenated.
    
    [> Other Functions of the Hyphen
  - |-
    Hyphens, finally, have several special applications. When a word is spelled out in composition, the pauses which in speech would separate the letters are signaled by hyphens:
    
    Affect is spelled a-t-f-e-c-t.
    
    If it is necessary to cite inflectional endings or prefixes, they are preceded (or followed) by a hyphen. No space is left between the hyphen and the first or last letter of the cited term:
    
    The regular sign of the plural in English is -s.
    Amti are common prefixes, while -ence is a frequent suffix.
    
    When several different words are understood to be commonly combined with the same final element to form compound words, hyphens are placed after each of the initial elements:

    Parentheses
    
    > To Enclose Parenthetical Matter
    
    Parenthetical matter is a word or construction (which may or may not be grammatically related to the rest of the sentence) sufficiently remote in relevance to require a stronger pause than a comma would supply:
    
    Even for those who can do their work in bed (like journalists), still more for those whose work cannot be done in bed (as, for example, the professional harpooner of whales), it is obvious that the indulgence must be very Occasional. G. K. Chesterton
    
    Parenthetical remarks of this nary—abshidle
    punctuated with Ueshessusemof interest and va-
    riety as well as of necessary information. Moreover, such in-
    trusions loosen the rhythm of a sentence, suggesting more
    interesting patterns of speech. The effectiveness of parenthet-
    ical remarks, however, depends on their scarcity. Using one
    in every other sentence costs you whatever advantage the de-
    vice had, and overused parentheses become an irritating
    mannerism.
    
    When a parenthetical remark comes inside a sentence, any
    stop that follows it must be set outside the closing parenthesis:
    
    In the last act of the play (or so it seems to me, for know there
    can be differences on this point), Hamlet accepts his world and we
    discover a different man. Maynard Mack
  - |-
    When a parenthetical remark closes a sentence, the period is also placed outside:
    
    I say only that a considerable number of [TV] set-owners are far from being entirely satisfied (those who are willing to pay and those who hardly ever use their sets). Gilbert Seldes
    
    However, if an entirely separate sentence is placed within quotes, the period which closes it (or the query or exclama-
    tion) must go inside:

    [>> Parentheses to Enclose Numbers or Letters
    Marking a Series
    
    When numbers or letters introduce the items in a list they
    should be put within parentheses to differentiate them from
    the text:
    
    We must do three things: $t0dy the route thoroughly, (2) pur-
    chase supplies and equipment, and (8) hire a reliable guide.
    
    Brackets
    
    Brackets (which look like this: [ ]) are used in composition to
    enclose within a quotation any words that are not a part of
    it. Sometimes a writer needs to explain or comment on some-
    thing in the quotation. The sample sentence by Gilbert Seldes
    in the section on parentheses contains such editorial addition
    set within brackets. In the following passage the writer adds
    a comment within the words spoken by a guide conducting
    tourists around Jerusalem:
    
    "This area," he would say as he showed us one of the Victorian
    monstrosities, "this area [it was one of his favorite words] is very
    rich in antiquity." Aldous Huxley
    
    Sometimes, too, it is necessary to alter a quotation slightly
    to fit into its grammatical an eontkatysadding
    or an ending, for instance. Any such addition to the actual
    quotation must be enclosed in brackets:
    
    Johnson writes that "monkeys ... [are] held in great esteem by the
    tribe."
    
    430 PUNCTUATION
    
    Finally, brackets are used to enclose parenthetical matter
    within parentheses (though such a labyrinthine style would
    be, with rare exceptions [of which this mot one], both un-
    usual and annoying).
    
    The Ellipsis
  - |-
    The ellipsis is a series of three dots, or, under certain condi-
    tions, four. It is never five or six or any other number. In
    composition the principal function of the ellipsis is to mark
    the omission of material from a quotation.
    
    If the deleted matter occurs within the quoted sentence,
    three dots are used:
    
    Dante, someone has remarked, is "the lagteat Catholic poet."
    
    Notice the spacing: spaces are left between the preceding
    word and the first dot, between each dot and the next, and
    between the last dot and the following word.
    
    If the omitted material includes the end of the sentence and/
    or the beginning of the next one, four dots are used:
    
    Dante, someone has noted, is "the last great Catholic poet... ."
    
    With four dots the spacing is a little different. The first dot,
    which represents the period of the original statement, is not
    separated from the word it follows, but the spacing between
    dots remains. Notice too that the ellipsis is placed inside the
    quote mark.
    
    If the original sentence from which the final words were
    dropped was closed by a query or exclamation point, the ap-
    propriate stop is placed immediately after the final word and
    is followed by a standard three-dot ellipsis:
    
    lhas been asked, "Was Dante the last great Catholic poet?. . ."
    
    THE OTHER MARKS 431
    
    It is considered simple honesty to use an ellipsis to ac-
    knowledge that you have omitted something from a passage
    you are quoting. Of course, the omission must not change
    the substance of what the other writer said, and if you do
    alter his or her meaning, the use of an ellipsis will not save
    you from a charge of dishonesty. The same caution applies to
    adding explanatory matter within brackets: it must not sub-
    stantially alter the original meaning.
    
    The ellipsis is also used in dialogue to indicate doubt, in-
    decision, weariness, and so on. In the following sentence, for
    example, the ellipsis signals not an omission of any words but
    the trailing off of the voice, suggesting the speaker's uncer-
    tainty:
    
    She sighed and answered, "I really don't know...."
    
    Sometimes too a writer will use an ellipsis to imply a con-
    clusion which readers are expected to infer for themselves:
    
    And we certainly know what that remark means... .

    Diacritics
    A diacritic is a mark placed above, below, or through a letter
    in order to indicate a special pronunciation. Diacritics are em-
    ployed because the number of letters in any language is usu-
    ally fewer than the number of sigferfeoansdynds.
    Diacritical marks thus supplement the alphabet, enabling a
    single letter to do the work of two. English, while it certainly
    has more sounds than letters, has dispensed with diacritical
    marks except for the diaeresis occasionally seen in words like
    natveooperate (meaning that the vowel is to be pro-
    nounced as a separate syllable).
    
    But diacritical marks are common in some other lan-
    guageds—diee and acute and the cedilla of French,
    (the, mlaut of German or the(ilde of Spanish ().
    When you use a foreign word not yet assimilated into English,
    432 PUNCTUATION
    
    reproduce the diacritics that the word has. (If you are typing,
    it is easiest to put these in with pencil afterwards.)
    
    Underlining
    
    Underlining is the compositional equivalent to italic type.
    There are several reasons for underlining a word or phrase.
    
    > Underline Titles
    
    The titles of newspapers, magazines and other periodicals,
    books, plays, films, paintings, and long poems are underlined.
    Titles of works which were not published separately, but
    rather as part of something else, are placed in quotation marks
    (these include magazine and journal articles, short stories,
    short poems, and also radio and television programs). With
    newspapers the title is what appears on the masthead, except
    that it is now customary not to italicize an initial article: the
    New York Times.
    
    Names of ships are also italicized, as are the titles of long
    musical works (symphonies, tone poems, operas; songs and
    shorter compositions are referred to in quotes).
    
    [> Underline Foreignisms
    
    Any foreign expression that has not been fully assimilated
    into English should be italicized:
    
    de trop (French: "unwanted, in the way")
    datae (Italian: "life that is sweet, easy, enjoyable")
    Schadenfreude (German: "malicious joy at the misfortunes of
    others")
  - |-
    Because English has always been quick to borrow words  
    from other languages and equally quick to anglicize their pro-  
    nunciation, it is often difficult to tell whether an imported  
    word is still considered foreign and should be underlined.  
    
    THE OTHER MARKS 433
    
    Few of us think of delicatessen, say, as a "German" word or  
    perfume as a "French" one, and in normal use these would  
    never be italicized. (They are in the preceding sentence be-  
    cause they are citation terms, not because they are foreign.)  
    But in between such fully accepted terms and plainly alien  
    ones like Schadenfreude, many words that have become re-  
    cently popular in English still have a faintly foreign air: bou-  
    tique, for instance, or detente. Editors differ on how to treat  
    such terms. If they are not listed in a standard dictionary, it  
    is never wrong to underline them.
    
    [>> Underline Citation Terms
    
    Words used in self-reference are called citation terms and are  
    usually underlined (less commonly, placed in quotes). In the  
    following pair of sentences, the tofmmtive a citation
    
    term in the first, but in the second it has its conventional  
    sense:
    
    To runis an infinitive.  
    He wanted to run.
    
    Sometimes citation terms are placed in quotes, but then  
    should not also be underlined. ISnderlining—that _ italics—  
    however, is the better choice.
    
    [> Underline for Emphasis
    
    In manuscripts, underlining stands for italics (as used in the  
    examples that follow). Underlining (italics) has several pur-  
    poses. When emphatic underlining is well done, it has the  
    effect not only of drawing attention to key words, but also  
    of suggesting an actual voice talking to us:
    
    The cause of pornography is not the same as the cause of free  
    speech. There is a difference. Barbara Tuchman

    it mvasieval Culture. Monis Bishoo  
    
    Capitalization
    
    When to use capital letters is a complicated matter; here we  
    mention only a few common occasions. You will find more  
    thorough discussions in dictionaries and in style books like  
    The Chicago Manual of Style, 13th Edition, published by The  
    University of Chicago Press.
  - |-
    [>Capitalize Titles
    
    The first and last words of a literary title should be capitalized,
    as should all words in-between except articles &, the),
    short prepositions, and coordinating conjunctions:
    
    The City of Women
    The Call of the Wild
    
    However, when an article follows a stop in the title (such as
    a colon or comma), it is usually treated as a second "first"
    word and capitalized:
    
    Charles Dickens, The Last of the Great Men
    
    Remember that the titles of works published or presented
    separately (books, magazines, plays, long poems, films) are
    italicized (underlined), while those published as part of some-
    thing larger are set in quotes (articles, short stories, most po-
    ems, and also television and radio programs).
    
    > Capitalize the First Word of a Quotation
    
    The opening word of quoted speech is capitalized, whether it
    begins a sentence or not. However, when a quotation is bro-
    ken, the first word of the continuation is not capitalized un-
    less it is a proper noun or adjective or begins a new sentence:
    
    He said, "We liked the movie very much."
    "We," he said, "liked the movie very much."
    
    With written quotations capitalization of the first word de-
    pends on whether the quotation is introduced after a stop or
    is worked into the sentence as a noun clause following that.
    In the first example which follows, the quotation begins with
    a capital; in the second, it does not, even though it may have
    done so in the original:
    
    G. K. Chesterton writes: "This is the veddar optimism of
    Dickens... ."
    G. K. Chesterton writes that "this is the wedjar optimism of
    Dickens. ..."
    
    [> Capitalize Proper Names and Adjectives
    
    A proper name is the designation of a particular person, place,
    structure, and so on. A proper adjective is a modifier derived
    from such a name.
    
    Specific People
    Harry Jones, Mary Winter, C. S. Lewis
    
    When the name includes a particle, the particle should be
    spaced and capitalized (or lowercased) according to accepted
    usage for that name:
    
    Gabriele D'Annunzio
    Charles de Gaulle
    
    Nouns, verbs, and modifiers derived from proper names
    are not capitalized when used in a sense generalized from their
    origin:
  - |-
    Charles Mackintosh BUT a mackintosh coat  
    the French language BUT french doors  
    
    43 PUNCTUATION  
    
    But if a proper adjective is used in a specialized sense  
    closely related to the name from which it derives, it should  
    be capitalized:  
    
    He had a de Gaullean sense of country.  
    Personal Titles  
    Capitalize these when they are part of a name but not  
    
    otherwise:  
    
    Judge Harry Jones BUT Harry Jones was made a judge.  
    Professor Mary Winter BUT Mary Winter became a professor.

    Europe, European Manhattan, Manhattanite  
    
    the East Coast 42 nd Street

    When a regional name is a common term given specific  
    application (like the Midwest of the United States), an adjec-  
    tive derived from it may or may not be capitalized. Consult  
    a dictionary or style manual for specific cases:  
    
    the Far East, Far Eastern history  
    the Midwest, midwestern cities  
    
    Structures: Names of Buildings, Bridges, and so on

    the Democratic Party BUT democratic countries  
    
    School Subjects and Courses  
    
    The subjects you take in college or high school are not capi-  
    talized unless they derive from proper nouns (this means lan-  
    guage courses only):  
    
    anthropology BUT English  
    chemistry BUT French  
    history BUT German  
    philosophy BUT Latin  
    
    Names of particular courses, however, are capitalized since  
    they are, in effect, titles:  
    
    biology BUT Biology 201  
    physics BUT Physics 101  
    
    4  
    
    Personification  
    
    When personified (that is, endowed metaphorically with hu-  
    man qualities) abstractions such as peace, war, winter are cap-  
    italized. In their conventional uses they are not:  
    
    We had a late spring last year.

    Last year Spring arrived reluctantly, hanging her head and dragging
    her feet.
