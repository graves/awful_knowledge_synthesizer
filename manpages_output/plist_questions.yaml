These types give you the means to\n     produce data that is meaningfully structured, transportable, storable,\n     and accessible, but still as efficient as possible. The property list\n     programming interface allows you to convert hierarchically structured\n     combinations of these basic types to and from two formats: standard XML\n     and an optimized, opaque binary format. This document describes the\n     standard XML format. The data can be saved to disk and later used to\n     reconstruct the original Core Foundation objects. Note that property\n     lists should be used for data that consists primarily of strings and\n     numbers because they are very inefficient when used with large blocks of\n     binary data."

    PROPERTY LIST STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS

         Property lists are constructed from the basic Core Foundation types
         CFString, CFNumber, CFBoolean, CFDate, and CFData. To build a complex
         data structure out of these basic types, you put them inside a
         CFDictionary or CFArray. To simplify programming with property lists, any
         of the property list types can also be referred to using a reference of
         type CFPropertyListRef.

         In a CFDictionary, data is structured as key-value pairs, where each key
         is a string and the key's value can be a CFString, a CFNumber, a
         CFBoolean, a CFDate, a CFData, a CFArray, or another CFDictionary. When
         using CFDictionary as a property list, all keys must be strings.

         In a CFArray, data is structured as an ordered collection of objects that
         can be accessed by index. In a property list, a CFArray can contain any
         of the basic property list types, as well as CFDictionary and other
         CFArray objects.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `plist`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nWhen property lists convert a collection of Core Foundation objects into\n     an XML property list, it wraps the property list using the document type\n     tag <plist>. The other tags used for the Core Foundation data types are\n     listed in the table below:\n\n     Core Foundation Types with XML Equivalents\n\t CF type\t XML tag\n\t CFString\t <string>\n\t CFNumber\t <real> or <integer>\n\t CFDate \t <date>\n\t CFBoolean\t <true/> or <false/>\n\t CFData \t <data>\n\t CFArray\t <array>\n\t CFDictionary\t <dict>\n\n     When encoding the contents of a CFDictionary, each member is encoded by\n     placing the dictionary key in a <key> tag and immediately following it\n     with the corresponding value in the appropriate tag from the table above.\n     See EXAMPLES below for an example XML data generated from a property\n     list.\n\n     The XML data format is documented here strictly for help in understanding\n     property lists and as a debugging aid. These tags may change in future\n     releases so you shouldn't rely on them directly. You should not edit the\n     XML data by hand unless you are very familiar with XML syntax and the\n     format of property lists. If you want to modify the contents of a\n     property list saved on disk as XML data, use the Property List Editor\n     application."
