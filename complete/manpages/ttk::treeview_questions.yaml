The tree widget can also\n       display column headings.  Columns may be accessed by number or by\n       symbolic names listed in the -columns widget option; see COLUMN\n       IDENTIFIERS.\n\n       Each item is identified by a unique name.  The widget will generate\n       item IDs if they are not supplied by the caller.  There is a\n       distinguished root item, named {}.  The root item itself is not\n       displayed; its children appear at the top level of the hierarchy."
