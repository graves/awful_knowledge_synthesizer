By\n       default, the hrStorageTable is preferred as it typically contains more\n       information.  However, the -Cu argument can be passed to snmpdf to\n       force the usage of the dskTable.\n\n       AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is instrumented to monitor\n       the gievn objects.  At its simplest, the AGENT specification will\n       consist of a hostname or an IPv4 address.  In this situation, the\n       command will attempt communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to\n       port 161 of the given target host. See the snmpcmd(1) manual page for a\n       full list of the possible formats for AGENT."
