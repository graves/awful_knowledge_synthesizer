Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `dbiprof`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDBIPROF(1)\t      User Contributed Perl Documentation\t    DBIPROF(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       dbiprof - command-line client for DBI::ProfileData\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       See a report of the ten queries with the longest total runtime in the\n       profile dump file prof1.out:\n\n\tdbiprof prof1.out\n\n       See the top 10 most frequently run queries in the profile file dbi.prof\n       (the default):\n\n\t dbiprof --sort count\n\n       See the same report with 15 entries:\n\n\t dbiprof --sort count --number 15\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This tool is a command-line client for the DBI::ProfileData.  It allows\n       you to analyze the profile data file produced by DBI::ProfileDumper and\n       produce various useful reports.\n\nOPTIONS\n       This program accepts the following options:\n\n       --number N\n\t   Produce this many items in the report.  Defaults to 10.  If set to\n\t   \"all\" then all results are shown.\n\n       --sort field\n\t   Sort results by the given field. Sorting by multiple fields isn't\n\t   currently supported (patches welcome).  The available sort fields\n\t   are:\n\n\t   total\n\t       Sorts by total time run time across all runs.  This is the\n\t       default sort.\n\n\t   longest\n\t       Sorts by the longest single run.\n\n\t   count\n\t       Sorts by total number of runs.\n\n\t   first\n\t       Sorts by the time taken in the first run.\n\n\t   shortest\n\t       Sorts by the shortest single run.\n\n\t   key1\n\t       Sorts by the value of the first element in the Path, which\n\t       should be numeric.  You can also sort by \"key2\" and \"key3\".\n\n       --reverse\n\t   Reverses the selected sort.\tFor example, to see a report of the\n\t   shortest overall time:\n\n\t     dbiprof --sort total --reverse\n\n       --match keyN=value\n\t   Consider only items where the specified key matches the given\n\t   value.  Keys are numbered from 1.  For example, let's say you used\n\t   a DBI::Profile Path of:\n\n\t     [ DBIprofile_Statement, DBIprofile_Methodname ]\n\n\t   And called dbiprof as in:\n\n\t     dbiprof --match key2=execute\n\n\t   Your report would only show execute queries, leaving out prepares,\n\t   fetches, etc.\n\n\t   If the value given starts and ends with slashes (\"/\") then it will\n\t   be treated as a regular expression.\tFor example, to only include\n\t   SELECT queries where key1 is the statement:\n\n\t     dbiprof --match key1=/^SELECT/\n\n\t   By default the match expression is matched case-insensitively, but\n\t   this can be changed with the --case-sensitive option.\n\n       --exclude keyN=value\n\t   Remove items for where the specified key matches the given value.\n\t   For example, to exclude all prepare entries where key2 is the\n\t   method name:\n\n\t     dbiprof --exclude key2=prepare\n\n\t   Like \"--match\", If the value given starts and ends with slashes\n\t   (\"/\") then it will be treated as a regular expression.  For\n\t   example, to exclude UPDATE queries where key1 is the statement:\n\n\t     dbiprof --match key1=/^UPDATE/\n\n\t   By default the exclude expression is matched case-insensitively,\n\t   but this can be changed with the --case-sensitive option.\n\n       --case-sensitive\n\t   Using this option causes --match and --exclude to work case-\n\t   sensitively.  Defaults to off.\n\n       --delete\n\t   Sets the \"DeleteFiles\" option to DBI::ProfileData which causes the\n\t   files to be deleted after reading. See DBI::ProfileData for more\n\t   details.\n\n       --dumpnodes\n\t   Print the list of nodes in the form of a perl data structure.  Use\n\t   the \"-sort\" option if you want the list sorted.\n\n       --version\n\t   Print the dbiprof version number and exit.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Sam Tregar <sam@tregar.com>\n\nCOPYRIGHT AND LICENSE\n       Copyright (C) 2002 Sam Tregar\n\n       This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it\n       under the same terms as Perl 5 itself.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       DBI::ProfileDumper, DBI::Profile, DBI.\n\nperl v5.34.0\t\t\t  2024-12-14\t\t\t    DBIPROF(1)"
