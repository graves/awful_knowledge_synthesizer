If you're looking for an introduction to object-oriented\n       programming in Perl, please see perlootut.\n\n       In order to understand Perl objects, you first need to understand\n       references in Perl. See perlreftut for details.\n\n       This document describes all of Perl's object-oriented (OO) features\n       from the ground up. If you're just looking to write some object-\n       oriented code of your own, you are probably better served by using one\n       of the object systems from CPAN described in perlootut.\n\n       If you're looking to write your own object system, or you need to\n       maintain code which implements objects from scratch then this document\n       will help you understand exactly how Perl does object orientation.\n\n       There are a few basic principles which define object oriented Perl:\n\n       1.  An object is simply a data structure that knows to which class it\n\t   belongs."

    A Class is Simply a Package
           Perl does not provide any special syntax for class definitions. A
           package is simply a namespace containing variables and subroutines. The
           only difference is that in a class, the subroutines may expect a
           reference to an object or the name of a class as the first argument.
           This is purely a matter of convention, so a class may contain both
           methods and subroutines which don't operate on an object or class.

           Each package contains a special array called @ISA. The @ISA array
           contains a list of that class's parent classes, if any. This array is
           examined when Perl does method resolution, which we will cover later.

           Calling methods from a package means it must be loaded, of course, so
           you will often want to load a module and add it to @ISA at the same
           time. You can do so in a single step using the parent pragma.  (In
           older code you may encounter the base pragma, which is nowadays
           discouraged except when you have to work with the equally discouraged
           fields pragma.)

    Manpage text:

    However the parent classes are set, the package's @ISA variable will
           contain a list of those parents. This is simply a list of scalars, each
           of which is a string that corresponds to a package name.

           All classes inherit from the UNIVERSAL class implicitly. The UNIVERSAL
           class is implemented by the Perl core, and provides several default
           methods, such as "isa()", "can()", and "VERSION()".  The "UNIVERSAL"
           class will never appear in a package's @ISA variable.

           Perl only provides method inheritance as a built-in feature.  Attribute
           inheritance is left up the class to implement. See the "Writing
           Accessors" section for details.

       A Method is Simply a Subroutine
           Perl does not provide any special syntax for defining a method. A
           method is simply a regular subroutine, and is declared with "sub".
           What makes a method special is that it expects to receive either an
           object or a class name as its first argument.

    Manpage text:

    Just as with any Perl subroutine, all of the arguments passed in @_ are
           aliases to the original argument. This includes the object itself.  If
           you assign directly to $_[0] you will change the contents of the
           variable that holds the reference to the object. We recommend that you
           don't do this unless you know exactly what you're doing.

           Perl knows what package the method is in by looking at the left side of
           the arrow. If the left hand side is a package name, it looks for the
           method in that package. If the left hand side is an object, then Perl
           looks for the method in the package that the object has been blessed
           into.

           If the left hand side is neither a package name nor an object, then the
           method call will cause an error, but see the section on "Method Call
           Variations" for more nuances.

       Inheritance
           We already talked about the special @ISA array and the parent pragma.

           When a class inherits from another class, any methods defined in the
           parent class are available to the child class. If you attempt to call a
           method on an object that isn't defined in its own class, Perl will also
           look for that method in any parent classes it may have.

    Manpage text:

    Attributes are often stored in the object itself. For example, if the
           object is an anonymous hash, we can store the attribute values in the
           hash using the attribute name as the key.

           While it's possible to refer directly to these hash keys outside of the
           class, it's considered a best practice to wrap all access to the
           attribute with accessor methods.

           This has several advantages. Accessors make it easier to change the
           implementation of an object later while still preserving the original
           API.

           An accessor lets you add additional code around attribute access. For
           example, you could apply a default to an attribute that wasn't set in
           the constructor, or you could validate that a new value for the
           attribute is acceptable.

           Finally, using accessors makes inheritance much simpler. Subclasses can
           use the accessors rather than having to know how a parent class is
           implemented internally.

    Destructors
           When the last reference to an object goes away, the object is
           destroyed. If you only have one reference to an object stored in a
           lexical scalar, the object is destroyed when that scalar goes out of
           scope. If you store the object in a package global, that object may not
           go out of scope until the program exits.

           If you want to do something when the object is destroyed, you can
           define a "DESTROY" method in your class. This method will always be
           called by Perl at the appropriate time, unless the method is empty.

           This is called just like any other method, with the object as the first
           argument. It does not receive any additional arguments. However, the
           $_[0] variable will be read-only in the destructor, so you cannot
           assign a value to it.

           If your "DESTROY" method throws an exception, this will not cause any
           control transfer beyond exiting the method.  The exception will be
           reported to "STDERR" as a warning, marked "(in cleanup)", and Perl will
           continue with whatever it was doing before.

If you want to detect\n       the global destruction phase on older versions of Perl, you can use the\n       \"Devel::GlobalDestruction\" module on CPAN.\n\n       If your \"DESTROY\" method issues a warning during global destruction,\n       the Perl interpreter will append the string \" during global\n       destruction\" to the warning.\n\n       During global destruction, Perl will always garbage collect objects\n       before unblessed references. See \"PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL\" in perlhacktips\n       for more information about global destruction.\n\n   Non-Hash Objects\n       All the examples so far have shown objects based on a blessed hash.\n       However, it's possible to bless any type of data structure or referent,\n       including scalars, globs, and subroutines. You may see this sort of\n       thing when looking at code in the wild."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlobj`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nHere's an example of a module as a blessed scalar:\n\n\t package Time;\n\n\t use strict;\n\t use warnings;\n\n\t sub new {\n\t     my $class = shift;\n\n\t     my $time = time;\n\t     return bless \\$time, $class;\n\t }\n\n\t sub epoch {\n\t     my $self = shift;\n\t     return $$self;\n\t }\n\n\t my $time = Time->new();\n\t print $time->epoch();\n\n   Inside-Out objects\n       In the past, the Perl community experimented with a technique called\n       \"inside-out objects\". An inside-out object stores its data outside of\n       the object's reference, indexed on a unique property of the object,\n       such as its memory address, rather than in the object itself. This has\n       the advantage of enforcing the encapsulation of object attributes,\n       since their data is not stored in the object itself.\n\n       This technique was popular for a while (and was recommended in Damian\n       Conway's Perl Best Practices), but never achieved universal adoption.\n       The Object::InsideOut module on CPAN provides a comprehensive\n       implementation of this technique, and you may see it or other inside-\n       out modules in the wild."
