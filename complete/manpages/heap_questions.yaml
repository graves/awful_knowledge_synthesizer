C++ objects are\n     identified by the vtable referenced from the start of the object, so with\n     multiple inheritance this may not give the precise class of the object.\n\n     If the target process is running with MallocStackLogging, then heap\n     attempts to identify the types of \"non-object\" allocations, using the\n     form \"<allocation-call> in <caller>\". The <caller> is determined by\n     walking up the allocation stack backtrace (if available) to find the\n     symbol name of the function that called an \"allocation function\", such as\n     malloc, calloc, realloc, C++ \"operator new\", strndup, various internal\n     functions of libc++.1.dylib, etc. If <caller> is a C++ function, the type\n     name is created by simplifying the demangled symbol name by removing the\n     return type, the \"__1::\" substrings from use of llvm's libc++abi.dylib,\n     and standard arguments such as \"std::__1::allocator<T>\".\""
