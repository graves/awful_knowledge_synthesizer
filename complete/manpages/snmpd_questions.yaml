Upon receiving a request, it processes the\n       request(s), collects the requested information and/or performs the\n       requested operation(s) and returns the information to the sender.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -a      Log the source addresses of incoming requests.\n\n       -A      Append to the log file rather than truncating it.\n\n       -c FILE Read FILE as a configuration file (or a comma-separated list of\n\t       configuration files).  Note that the loaded file will only\n\t       understand snmpd.conf tokens, unless the configuration type is\n\t       specified in the file as described in the snmp_config man page\n\t       under SWITCHING CONFIGURATION TYPES IN MID-FILE.\n\n       -C      Do not read any configuration files except the ones optionally\n\t       specified by the -c option.  Note that this behaviour also\n\t       covers the persistent configuration files.  This may result in\n\t       dynamically-assigned values being reset following an agent\n\t       restart, unless the relevant persistent config files are\n\t       explicitly loaded using the -c option."
