To restrict the SSH\n     client and server to use only FIPS algorithms, customize the\n     configuration as directed below.\n\n     The configuration files for ssh(1) and sshd(8) read the algorithm\n     configuration directives from /etc/ssh/crypto.conf, which should be a\n     symbolic link to either the macOS default algorithm configuration file\n     /etc/ssh/crypto/apple.conf, or to the FIPS-only configuration file\n     /etc/ssh/crypto/fips.conf.  To choose FIPS algorithms only, update the\n     symbolic link as follows.\n\n\t   sudo ln -fs crypto/fips.conf /etc/ssh/crypto.conf\n\n     To return to the default set of algorithms which largely prefer FIPS\n     algorithms but allow others as well:"
