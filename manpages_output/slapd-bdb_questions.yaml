It makes extensive use of indexing and caching to speed\n       data access.\n\n       hdb is the recommended primary database backend.  It is a variant of\n       the bdb backend that uses a hierarchical database layout which supports\n       subtree renames. It is both more space-efficient and more execution-\n       efficient than the bdb backend.\tIt is otherwise identical to the bdb\n       behavior, and all the same configuration options apply.\n\n       It is noted that these options are intended to complement Berkeley DB\n       configuration options set in the environment's DB_CONFIG file.  See\n       Berkeley DB documentation for details on DB_CONFIG configuration\n       options.  Where there is overlap, settings in DB_CONFIG take\n       precedence."

Other\n       database options are described in the slapd.conf(5) manual page.\n\n       cachesize_<integer>\n\t      Specify the size in entries of the in-memory entry cache\n\t      maintained by the bdb or hdb backend database instance.  The\n\t      default is 1000 entries.\n\n       cachefree_<integer>\n\t      Specify the number of entries to free from the entry cache when\n\t      the cache reaches the cachesize limit.  The default is 1 entry.\n\n       checkpoint_<kbyte>_<min>\n\t      Specify the frequency for checkpointing the database transaction\n\t      log.  A checkpoint operation flushes the database buffers to\n\t      disk and writes a checkpoint record in the log.  The checkpoint\n\t      will occur if either <kbyte> data has been written or <min>\n\t      minutes have passed since the last checkpoint.  Both arguments\n\t      default to zero, in which case they are ignored. When the <min>\n\t      argument is non-zero, an internal task will run every <min>\n\t      minutes to perform the checkpoint.  See the Berkeley DB\n\t      reference guide for more details."
