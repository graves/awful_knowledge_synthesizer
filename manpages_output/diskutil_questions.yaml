It provides\n     information about, and allows the administration of, partitioning\n     schemes, layouts, and formats of disks. This includes hard disks, solid\n     state disks, optical discs, disk images, APFS volumes, CoreStorage\n     volumes, and AppleRAID sets.  It generally manipulates whole volumes\n     instead of individual files and directories.\n\nCAUTION\n     Many diskutil commands, if improperly used, can result in data loss. Most\n     commands do not present confirmation prompts.  You should back up your\n     data before using any of these commands.\n\nVERBS\n     Each command verb is listed with its description and individual\n     arguments.\n\n     list [-plist] [internal | external] [physical | virtual] [device]\n\t\tList disks, including internal and external disks, whole disks\n\t\tand partitions, and various kinds of virtual or offline disks."

AppleRAID supports three\n\t\tbasic types of RAID sets:\n\n\t\t      â€¢   \"stripe\" - Striped Volume (RAID 0)\n\n\t\t      â€¢   \"mirror\" - Mirrored Volume (RAID 1)\n\n\t\t      â€¢   \"concat\" - Concatenated Volume (Spanning)\n\n\t\tOf these three basic types, only the \"mirror\" type increases\n\t\tfault-tolerance.  Mirrors may have more than two disks to\n\t\tfurther increase their fault-tolerance.  Striped and\n\t\tconcatentated volumes are, in fact, more vulnerable to faults\n\t\tthan single disk volumes.\n\n\t\tFrom these basic types, \"stacked\" or \"nested\" RAID volumes can\n\t\tbe created.  Stacked RAID sets that make use of mirrored RAID\n\t\tsets are fault-tolerant.  For example, these are some of the\n\t\tmore common combinations of stacked RAID sets:\n\n\t\t      â€¢   RAID 50 - A striped RAID set of hardware RAID 5\n\t\t\t  disks.\n\n\t\t      â€¢   RAID 10 - A striped RAID set of mirrored RAID sets.\n\n\t\t      â€¢   RAID 0+1 - A mirrored RAID set of striped RAID sets.\n\n\t\t      â€¢   Concatenated Mirror - A concatenation of mirrored\n\t\t\t  RAID sets.\n\n\t\tWhen creating new RAID sets or adding disks, if possible, it\n\t\tis better to specify the entire disk instead of a partition on\n\t\tthat disk.  This allows the software to reformat the entire\n\t\tdisk using the most current partition layouts.\tWhen using\n\t\twhole disks, the type of partitioning used is selected based\n\t\ton the platform type (PPC = APMFormat, Intel = GPTFormat).\n\t\tGPT and APM partition formats cannot be mixed in the same RAID\n\t\tset.\n\n\t\tIn addition to whole disk and partition device names,\n\t\tAppleRAID uses UUIDs to refer to existing RAID sets and their\n\t\tmembers.  Existing RAID sets may also be specified by mount\n\t\tpoint (e.g.  /Volume/raidset). In many cases, using the UUID\n\t\tfor the device argument is preferred because disk device names\n\t\tmay change over time when disks are added, disks are removed\n\t\tor when the system is rebooted.  If RAID members have been\n\t\tphysically disconnected from the system or are no longer\n\t\tresponding, you must use the member's UUID as the command\n\t\targument.  Messages in the system log will refer to RAID sets\n\t\tand their member disks by UUID.  For more information on\n\t\tspecifying device arguments, see the DEVICES section below.\n\n\t\tAppleRAID is not a replacement for backing up your data.\n\t\tBackups should be always be performed on a regular basis and\n\t\tbefore modifying any RAID set using these commands.\n\n\t\tThe following is a list of appleRAID sub-verbs with their\n\t\tdescriptions and individual arguments.\n\n\t\tlist [-plist | UUID]\n\t\t\t   Display AppleRAID volumes with current status and\n\t\t\t   associated member disks.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `diskutil`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIt is important for software to avoid relying on numerical ordering of\n     any of the parts.\tActivities including but not limited to partition\n     deletions and insertions, partition resizing, virtual volume deletions\n     and additions, device ejects and attachments due to media insertion\n     cycles, plug cycles, authentication lock cycles or reboots, can all cause\n     (temporary) gaps and non-increments in the numerical ordering of any of\n     the parts. You must rely on more persistent means of identification, such\n     as the various UUIDs.\n\nSIZES\n     Wherever a size is emitted as an output, it is presented as a base-ten\n     approximation to the precision of one fractional decimal digit and a\n     base-ten SI multiplier, often accompanied by a precise count in bytes.\n     Scripts should refrain from parsing this human-readable output and use\n     the -plist option instead.\n\n     Wherever a size is to be supplied by you as an input, you can provide\n     values in a number of different ways, some absolute and some context-\n     sensitive.  Values are interpreted as base ten and must be positive with\n     no preceding \"+\".\tAn integer without a suffix is taken to mean an exact\n     number of bytes (e.g. 5368709120).  Multiplier suffixes are optional,\n     must follow your value immediately without whitespace, and allow your\n     value to be a real number (e.g. 5.1234t).\tSome of the specifiers below\n     should not have a preceding value at all (e.g. the letter R for\n     \"remainder\")."
