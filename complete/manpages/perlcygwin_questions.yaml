They run thanks to the Cygwin library which provides\n       the UNIX system calls and environment these programs expect.

The only dependencies\n       come from hard-coded pathnames like /usr/local.\tHowever, your host\n       system and Cygwin configuration will affect Perl's runtime behavior\n       (see \"TEST\").\n\n       •   \"PATH\"\n\n\t   Set the \"PATH\" environment variable so that Configure finds the\n\t   Cygwin versions of programs.
