If no\n     assertion flags are specified, caffeinate creates an assertion to prevent\n     idle sleep.  If a utility is specified, caffeinate creates the assertions\n     on the utility's behalf, and those assertions will persist for the\n     duration of the utility's execution. Otherwise, caffeinate creates the\n     assertions directly, and those assertions will persist until caffeinate\n     exits.\n\n     Available options:\n\n     -d      Create an assertion to prevent the display from sleeping.\n\n     -i      Create an assertion to prevent the system from idle sleeping.\n\n     -m      Create an assertion to prevent the disk from idle sleeping.\n\n     -s      Create an assertion to prevent the system from sleeping. This\n\t     assertion is valid only when system is running on AC power."

If the\n\t     display is off, this option turns the display on and prevents the\n\t     display from going into idle sleep. If a timeout is not specified\n\t     with '-t' option, then this assertion is taken with a default of\n\t     5 second timeout.\n\n     -t      Specifies the timeout value in seconds for which this assertion\n\t     has to be valid. The assertion is dropped after the specified\n\t     timeout. Timeout value is not used when an utility is invoked\n\t     with this command.\n\n     -w      Waits for the process with the specified pid to exit. Once the\n\t     the process exits, the assertion is also released.  This option\n\t     is ignored when used with utility option.\n\nEXAMPLE\n     caffeinate -i make\n\tcaffeinate forks a process, execs \"make\" in it, and holds an assertion\n     that prevents idle sleep as long as that process is running.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     pmset(1)\n\nLOCATION\n     /usr/bin/caffeinate\n\nDarwin\t\t\t       November 9, 2012 \t\t\tDarwin"
