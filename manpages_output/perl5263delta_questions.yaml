However, this secure extraction mode could\n       be bypassed by putting a symlink and a regular file with the same name\n       into the tar file.\n\n       [GH #16580] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16580> [cpan #125523]\n       <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125523>\n\n   [CVE-2018-18311] Integer overflow leading to buffer overflow and\n       segmentation fault\n       Integer arithmetic in \"Perl_my_setenv()\" could wrap when the combined\n       length of the environment variable name and value exceeded around\n       0x7fffffff.  This could lead to writing beyond the end of an allocated\n       buffer with attacker supplied data.\n\n       [GH #16560] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16560>\n\n   [CVE-2018-18312] Heap-buffer-overflow write in S_regatom (regcomp.c)\n       A crafted regular expression could cause heap-buffer-overflow write\n       during compilation, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.\n\n       [GH #16649] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16649>\n\n   [CVE-2018-18313] Heap-buffer-overflow read in S_grok_bslash_N (regcomp.c)\n       A crafted regular expression could cause heap-buffer-overflow read\n       during compilation, potentially leading to sensitive information being\n       leaked.\n\n       [GH #16554] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16554>\n\n   [CVE-2018-18314] Heap-buffer-overflow write in S_regatom (regcomp.c)\n       A crafted regular expression could cause heap-buffer-overflow write\n       during compilation, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.\n\n       [GH #16041] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16041>\n\nIncompatible Changes\n       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.26.2.  If any\n       exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See\n       \"Reporting Bugs\" below.\n\nModules and Pragmata\n   Updated Modules and Pragmata\n       •   Archive::Tar has been upgraded from version 2.24 to 2.24_01.\n\n       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20180414_26 to\n\t   5.20181129_26.\n\nDiagnostics\n       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,\n       including warnings and fatal error messages.

The following people are known to\n       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.26.3:\n\n       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dagfinn Ilmari\n       Mannsaaker, David Mitchell, H.Merijn Brand, James E Keenan, John SJ\n       Anderson, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Todd\n       Rinaldo, Tony Cook, Yves Orton.\n\n       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically\n       generated from version control history.\tIn particular, it does not\n       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who\n       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.\n\n       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN\n       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN\n       community for helping Perl to flourish.\n\n       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,\n       please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.\n\nReporting Bugs\n       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug\n       database at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at\n       <http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.\n\n       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug\n       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a\n       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output\n       of \"perl -V\", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by\n       the Perl porting team.\n\n       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it\n       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see\n       \"SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION\" in perlsec for details of\n       how to report the issue.\n\nGive Thanks\n       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in\n       Perl 5, you can do so by running the \"perlthanks\" program:\n\n\t   perlthanks\n\n       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of\n       thanks.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for an explanation of how to view exhaustive details\n       on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t      PERL5263DELTA(1)"
