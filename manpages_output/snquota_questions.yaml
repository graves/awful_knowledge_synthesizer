Quota limits apply\n       to the space consumed by disk-block allocations for a user or group,\n       which is not equal to the sum of their file sizes.  Disk-block\n       allocations can be less than the file size if the file is sparse, or\n       more if the file system has allocated extra sequential blocks for the\n       efficiency of anticipated future writes.\n\n       There are three types of quotas: user quotas, group quotas, and\n       directory quotas.  User and group quotas limit the number of volume\n       blocks that can be allocated by the user or group on which the limit is\n       placed.\tWhen quotas are on, the total allocated volume space of all\n       users and groups that own files in the volume are automatically kept."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `snquota`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDirectory quotas are a little different.  The system does not\n       automatically keep track of the usage for each directory.  The snquota\n       command allows directories to be turned into the root of a Directory\n       Quota Name Space (DQNS).  Then, the number and size of all files in the\n       directory and all its subdirectories are tracked and (optionally)\n       limited.\n\n       For all quota types, limits and usage values only apply to regular\n       files, not directories, symlinks, or special device files\n\n       Each quota entity has two limits associated with it.  These are the\n       hard limit and the soft limit.\n\n       The hard limit is the absolute limit which volume space usage should\n       not exceed.  Any time the total allocated space is at or over the hard\n       limit, all further allocations or write requests by the offending user\n       or group will be denied.\n\n       The soft limit is a lesser limit.  When the user exceeds this limit\n       (but not the hard limit), allocations are still permitted for a while,\n       but a warning message will be written to the logs.  (View the messages\n       with Console.app or the dmesg command.)\tWhen the soft limit has been\n       overrun for longer than the grace period, the soft limit becomes a hard\n       limit and any further allocations or write requests are denied.\tWhen\n       the usage again falls below the soft limit, allocation requests will\n       again be serviced."

    Manpage text:

    Previous versions of snquota required all three of the limit values
           (hard, soft, and grace) to be set or all three to be unset.  This
           version relaxes that somewhat.  It is now possible to specify just a
           hard limit without a soft and grace limit.  It's also possible to set a
           soft limit and grace period without a hard limit.  It's also possible
           to specify a soft limit without any grace period (such a limit warns
           periodically, but never prevents allocation).  It's still not possible
           to specify a grace period without a soft limit. Although all three
           values (-h, -s, -t) still need to be on the command line, you can set
           the limits that should not be enforced to zero.

           For performance reasons related to the distributed nature of Xsan,
           quota overruns are not only possible but likely.  The overrun size
           depends upon a number of factors including the size of the allocation
           request(s) at the time of the quota overrun.

    Manpage text:

    Some versions of snquota support setting default limits for the various
           types of quotas.  For example, you can set a default hard limit, soft
           limit, and grace period for all users.  After doing that, any new user
           created will inherit those limits.  Note that setting default limits
           will not change the limits of existing quota entities.  Use the -0
           option and either "-u default", "-g default", "-d default", or "-fd
           default".  See the examples section.

           When working with Directory Quotas, the specified volume must be
           mounted on the node running snquota.

           Limits are not enforced against super-user accounts.

    DIRECTORY QUOTA NAME SPACES
           DQNSs are created by either of two actions, -C or -M.  They have
           different performance trade-offs and which one to use depends on the
           situation at hand.

           The -C action creates a DQNS whose usage values (the amount of disk
           space and the number of files) are already initialized to the correct
           value.  In order to initialize them, snquota must walk the directory
           tree under the root of the DQNS and tally up how much disk space is
           used.  For big directory trees, this process can take a long time.  Any
           modifications to the files and directories in the DQNS will be stalled
           until this walk is complete.

In order to initialize the DQNS so the values are correct,\n       the quota database must be rebuild using the -R action.\tA rebuild runs\n       much faster than a file-tree walk on a per-inode basis, but it must\n       look at all of the inodes in the volume.  When the rebuild is running,\n       modifications to the volume will be stalled until the rebuild is\n       complete.\n\n       So, when creating a DQNS that is believed to contain only a small\n       percentage of the inodes in the volume, use -C.\tWhen creating a DQNS\n       (or many DQNSs) that use a large percentage of the files, use -M.\n\n       A typical situation where -M would be useful is converting an existing\n       volume to use directory quotas.\tFirst every directory which needs to\n       be a DQNS root is marked with a call to \"snquota -M\".
