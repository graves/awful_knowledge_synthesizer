Since\n     traditional implementations of the mdoc(7) and man(7) manual formatting\n     languages are based on it, many real-world manuals use small numbers of\n     roff requests and escape sequences intermixed with their mdoc(7) or\n     man(7) code.  To properly format such manuals, the mandoc(1) utility\n     supports a subset of roff requests and escapes.  Even though this manual\n     page lists all roff requests and escape sequences, it only contains\n     partial information about requests not supported by mandoc(1) and about\n     language features that do not matter for manual pages.  For complete roff\n     manuals, consult the SEE ALSO section.\n\n     Input lines beginning with the control character ‘.’ are parsed for\n     requests and macros.  Such lines are called “request lines” or “macro\n     lines”, respectively.  Requests change the processing state and\n     manipulate the formatting; some macros also define the document structure\n     and produce formatted output.  The single quote (\"'\") is accepted as an\n     alternative control character, treated by mandoc(1) just like ‘.’"

The\n     backslash character ‘\\’ indicates the start of an escape sequence, used\n     for example for Comments and Special Characters.  For a complete listing\n     of escape sequences, consult the ESCAPE SEQUENCE REFERENCE below.\n\n   Comments\n     Text following an escaped double-quote ‘\\\"’, whether in a request, macro,\n     or text line, is ignored to the end of the line.  A request line\n     beginning with a control character and comment escape ‘.\\\"’ is also\n     ignored.  Furthermore, request lines with only a control character and\n     optional trailing whitespace are stripped from input.\n\n     Examples:\n\t   .\\\" This is a comment line.\n\t   .\\\" The next line is ignored:\n\t   .\n\t   .Sh EXAMPLES \\\" This is a comment, too.\n\t   example text \\\" And so is this."

They may occur in request, macro, and\n     text lines.  Sequences begin with the escape character ‘\\’ followed by\n     either an open-parenthesis ‘(’ for two-character sequences; an open-\n     bracket ‘[’ for n-character sequences (terminated at a close-bracket\n     ‘]’); or a single one character sequence.\n\n     Examples:\n\t   \\(em    Two-letter em dash escape.\n\t   \\e\t   One-letter backslash escape.\n\n     See mandoc_char(7) for a complete list.\n\n   Font Selection\n     In mdoc(7) and man(7) documents, fonts are usually selected with macros.\n     The \\f escape sequence and the ft request can be used to manually change\n     the font, but this is not recommended in mdoc(7) documents.  Such manual\n     font changes are overridden by many subsequent macros.\n\n     The following fonts are supported:\n\n\t   B   Bold font.\n\t   BI  A font that is both bold and italic.\n\t   CB  Bold constant width font.

Same as R in terminal output.\n\t   CW  An alias for CR.\n\t   I   Italic font.\n\t   P   Return to the previous font.  If a macro caused a font change\n\t       since the last \\f eascape sequence or ft request, this returns\n\t       to the font before the last font change in the macro rather\n\t       than to the font before the last manual font change.\n\t   R   Roman font.

When called, they follow the same syntax as\n     requests, except that macro arguments may optionally be quoted by\n     enclosing them in double quote characters (‘\"’).  Quoted text, even if it\n     contains whitespace or would cause a macro invocation when unquoted, is\n     always considered literal text.  Inside quoted text, pairs of double\n     quote characters (‘\"\"’) resolve to single double quote characters.\n\n     To be recognised as the beginning of a quoted argument, the opening quote\n     character must be preceded by a space character.  A quoted argument\n     extends to the next double quote character that is not part of a pair, or\n     to the end of the input line, whichever comes earlier.  Leaving out the\n     terminating double quote character at the end of the line is discouraged.\n     For clarity, if more arguments follow on the same input line, it is\n     recommended to follow the terminating double quote character by a space\n     character; in case the next character after the terminating double quote\n     character is anything else, it is regarded as the beginning of the next,\n     unquoted argument."

    HISTORY
         The RUNOFF typesetting system, whose input forms the basis for roff, was
         written in MAD and FAP for the CTSS operating system by Jerome E.
         Saltzer in 1964.  Doug McIlroy rewrote it in BCPL in 1969, renaming it
         roff.  Dennis M. Ritchie rewrote McIlroy's roff in PDP-11 assembly for
         Version 1 AT&T UNIX, Joseph F. Ossanna improved roff and renamed it nroff
         for Version 2 AT&T UNIX, then ported nroff to C as troff, which Brian W.
         Kernighan released with Version 7 AT&T UNIX.  In 1989, James Clark re-
         implemented troff in C++, naming it groff.
