A header is printed once. The row items are separated\n     by spaces.\n     Address to hostname lookups are not performed. The -Z option allows flows\n     that do not send or receive any data to not be listed.\n     An experimental nettop style display may be requested via use of the -N\n     option as the first option on the command line.\n\nOPTIONS\n     A list of flags and their descriptions:\n\n     -v       Verbose output\n\n     -h       Print command line usage information and exit.\n\n     -i interval\n\t      Report socket statistics periodically.\n\n     -I iterations\n\t      Used in combination with -i, will make netlog exit after the\n\t      specified number of iterations."
