The\n     new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80\n     terminal.\tIf arguments are not specified, the current month is\n     displayed.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -h      Turns off highlighting of today.\n\n     -J      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the -e option, display\n\t     date of Easter according to the Julian Calendar.\n\n     -e      Display date of Easter (for western churches)."

    Manpage text:

    Not all options can be used together.  For example “-3 -A 2 -B 3 -y -m 7”
         would mean: show me the three months around the seventh month, three
         before that, two after that and the whole year.  ncal will warn about
         these combinations.

         A year starts on January 1.

         Highlighting of dates is disabled if stdout is not a tty.

    SEE ALSO
         calendar(3), strftime(3)

    STANDARDS
         The cal utility is compliant with the X/Open System Interfaces option of
         the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”) specification.

         The flags [-3hyJeopw], as well as the ability to specify a month name as
         a single argument, are extensions to that specification.

         The week number computed by -w is compliant with the ISO 8601
         specification.

    HISTORY
         A cal command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.  The ncal command appeared
         in FreeBSD 2.2.6.

    AUTHORS
         The ncal command and manual were written by Wolfgang Helbig
         <helbig@FreeBSD.org>.

    BUGS
         The assignment of Julian–Gregorian switching dates to country codes is
         historically naive for many countries.
