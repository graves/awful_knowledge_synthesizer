(NOTE: to\n       view and adjust the Proxy Server settings on Windows systems, use the\n       LAN Client/Gateway tab in the Client Configuration tool instead.)\n\nSYNTAX\n       The -e option is used to edit the default dpserver configuration file.\n       If no default dpserver file exists, a template file will be generated.\n       The template file contains commented-out entries for each of the\n       network interfaces on the system, and commented-out entries for each of\n       the tunable parameters, specifying default values.\n\n       The -E VolName option is used to edit the file-system-specific dpserver\n       configuration file for the specified file system.  As with -e, a\n       template file will be generated if no file-system-specific dpserver\n       file exists."
