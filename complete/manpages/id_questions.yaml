If the real and effective IDs\n     are different, both are displayed, otherwise only the real ID is\n     displayed.\n\n     If a user (login name or user ID) is specified, the user and group IDs of\n     that user are displayed.  In this case, the real and effective IDs are\n     assumed to be the same.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -A      Display the process audit user ID and other process audit\n\t     properties, which requires privilege.\n\n     -F      Display the full name of the user.\n\n     -G      Display the different group IDs (effective, real and\n\t     supplementary) as white-space separated numbers, in no particular\n\t     order."
