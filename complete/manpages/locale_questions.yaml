For each keyword it is given, the\n     current value is displayed.\n\nOPTIONS\n     -a       Lists all public locales.\n\n     -c name ...\n\t      Lists the category name before each keyword, unless it is the\n\t      same category as the previously displayed keyword.\n\n     -k name ...\n\t      Displays the name of each keyword prior to its value.\n\n     -m       Lists all available public charmaps.  Darwin locales do not\n\t      support charmaps, so list all CODESETs instead.\n\nOPERANDS\n     The following operand is supported:"
