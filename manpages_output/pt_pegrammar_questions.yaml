Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This package provides commands to work with the serializations of\n       parsing expression grammars as managed by the Parser Tools, and\n       specified in section PEG serialization format.\n\n       This is a supporting package in the Core Layer of Parser Tools.\n\n       IMAGE: arch_core_support\n\nAPI\n       ::pt::peg verify serial ?canonvar?\n\t      This command verifies that the content of serial is a valid\n\t      serialization of a parsing expression and will throw an error if\n\t      that is not the case. The result of the command is the empty\n\t      string.\n\n\t      If the argument canonvar is specified it is interpreted as the\n\t      name of a variable in the calling context. This variable will be\n\t      written to if and only if serial is a valid regular\n\t      serialization. Its value will be a boolean, with True indicating\n\t      that the serialization is not only valid, but also canonical.\n\t      False will be written for a valid, but non-canonical\n\t      serialization.\n\n\t      For the specification of serializations see the section PE\n\t      serialization format.\n\n       ::pt::peg verify-as-canonical serial\n\t      This command verifies that the content of serial is a valid\n\t      canonical serialization of a PEG and will throw an error if that\n\t      is not the case. The result of the command is the empty string.\n\n\t      For the specification of canonical serializations see the\n\t      section PEG serialization format.\n\n       ::pt::peg canonicalize serial\n\t      This command assumes that the content of serial is a valid\n\t      regular serialization of a PEG and will throw an error if that\n\t      is not the case.\n\n\t      It will then convert the input into the canonical serialization\n\t      of the contained PEG and return it as its result. If the input\n\t      is already canonical it will be returned unchanged.\n\n\t      For the specification of regular and canonical serializations\n\t      see the section PEG serialization format.\n\n       ::pt::peg print serial\n\t      This command assumes that the argument serial contains a valid\n\t      serialization of a parsing expression and returns a string\n\t      containing that PE in a human readable form.\n\n\t      The exact format of this form is not specified and cannot be\n\t      relied on for parsing or other machine-based activities.\n\n\t      For the specification of serializations see the section PEG\n\t      serialization format.\n\n       ::pt::peg merge seriala serialb\n\t      This command accepts the regular serializations of two grammars\n\t      and uses them to create their union.  The result of the command\n\t      is the canonical serialization of this unified grammar.\n\n\t      A merge errors occurs if for any nonterminal symbol S occuring\n\t      in both input grammars the two input grammars specify different\n\t      semantic modes.\n\n\t      The semantic mode of each nonterminal symbol S is the semantic\n\t      mode of S in any of its input grammars. The previous rule made\n\t      sure that for symbols occuring in both grammars these values are\n\t      identical.\n\n\t      The right-hand side of each nonterminal symbol S occuring in\n\t      both input grammars is the choice between the right-hand sides\n\t      of S in the input grammars, with the parsing expression of S in\n\t      seriala coming first, except if both expressions are identical.\n\t      In that case the first expression is taken.\n\n\t      The right-hand side of each nonterminal symbol S occuring in\n\t      only one of the input grammars is the right-hand side of S in\n\t      its input grammar.\n\n\t      The start expression of the unified grammar is the choice\n\t      between the start expressions of the input grammars, with the\n\t      start expression of seriala coming first, except if both\n\t      expressions are identical.  In that case the first expression is\n\t      taken\n\n       ::pt::peg equal seriala serialb\n\t      This command tests the two grammars seriala and serialb for\n\t      structural equality. The result of the command is a boolean\n\t      value. It will be set to true if the expressions are identical,\n\t      and false otherwise.\n\n\t      String equality is usable only if we can assume that the two\n\t      grammars are pure Tcl lists and dictionaries.\n\nPEG SERIALIZATION FORMAT\n       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize\n       Parsing Expression Grammars as immutable values for transport,\n       comparison, etc.\n\n       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a\n       PEG may have more than one regular serialization only exactly one of\n       them will be canonical.\n\n       regular serialization\n\n\t      [1]    The serialization of any PEG is a nested Tcl dictionary.\n\n\t      [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, pt::grammar::peg, and\n\t\t     its value. This value holds the contents of the grammar.\n\n\t      [3]    The contents of the grammar are a Tcl dictionary holding\n\t\t     the set of nonterminal symbols and the starting\n\t\t     expression. The relevant keys and their values are\n\n\t\t     rules  The value is a Tcl dictionary whose keys are the\n\t\t\t    names of the nonterminal symbols known to the\n\t\t\t    grammar.\n\n\t\t\t    [1]    Each nonterminal symbol may occur only\n\t\t\t\t   once.\n\n\t\t\t    [2]    The empty string is not a legal nonterminal\n\t\t\t\t   symbol.\n\n\t\t\t    [3]    The value for each symbol is a Tcl\n\t\t\t\t   dictionary itself.
