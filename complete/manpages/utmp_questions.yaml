The time stamps of date changes, shutdowns\n     and reboots are also logged in the wtmp file.\n\n     These files can grow rapidly on busy systems, daily or weekly rotation is\n     recommended.  If any of these files do not exist, it is not created.\n     These files must be created manually and are normally maintained in\n     either the script /etc/daily or the script /etc/weekly.
