Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In\n       that case please read the overview provided by the Introduction to\n       Parser Tools. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the\n       current package is a part of.\n\n       This package provides a manager for parsing expression grammars, with\n       each instance handling a set of plugins for the import of them from\n       other formats, i.e. their conversion from, for example peg, container,\n       json, etc.\n\n       It resides in the Import section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools, and\n       is one of the three pillars the management of parsing expression\n       grammars resides on.\n\n       IMAGE: arch_core_import\n\n       The other two pillars are, as shown above\n\n       [1]    PEG Export, and\n\n       [2]    PEG Storage\n\n       For information about the data structure which is the major output of\n       the manager objects provided by this package see the section PEG\n       serialization format.\n\n       The plugin system of our class is based on the package pluginmgr, and\n       configured to look for plugins using\n\n       [1]    the environment variable GRAMMAR_PEG_IMPORT_PLUGINS,\n\n       [2]    the environment variable GRAMMAR_PEG_PLUGINS,\n\n       [3]    the environment variable GRAMMAR_PLUGINS,\n\n       [4]    the path \"~/.grammar/peg/import/plugin\"\n\n       [5]    the path \"~/.grammar/peg/plugin\"\n\n       [6]    the path \"~/.grammar/plugin\"\n\n       [7]    the path \"~/.grammar/peg/import/plugins\"\n\n       [8]    the path \"~/.grammar/peg/plugins\"\n\n       [9]    the path \"~/.grammar/plugins\"\n\n       [10]   the registry entry\n\t      \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\GRAMMAR\\PEG\\IMPORT\\PLUGINS\"\n\n       [11]   the registry entry\n\t      \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\GRAMMAR\\PEG\\PLUGINS\"\n\n       [12]   the registry entry \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\GRAMMAR\\PLUGINS\"\n\n       The last three are used only when the package is run on a machine using\n       the Windows(tm) operating system.\n\n       The whole system is delivered with three predefined import plugins,\n       namely\n\n       container\n\t      See PEG Import Plugin. From CONTAINER format for details.\n\n       json   See PEG Import Plugin. From JSON format for details.\n\n       peg    See PEG Import Plugin. From PEG format for details.\n\n       For readers wishing to write their own import plugin for some format,\n       i.e. plugin writers, reading and understanding the Parser Tools Impport\n       API specification is an absolute necessity, as it documents the\n       interaction between this package and its plugins in detail.\n\nAPI\n   PACKAGE COMMANDS\n       ::pt::peg::import objectName\n\t      This command creates a new import manager object with an\n\t      associated Tcl command whose name is objectName. This object\n\t      command is explained in full detail in the sections Object\n\t      command and Object methods. The object command will be created\n\t      under the current namespace if the objectName is not fully\n\t      qualified, and in the specified namespace otherwise.\n\n   OBJECT COMMAND\n       All objects created by the ::pt::peg::import command have the following\n       general form:\n\n       objectName method ?arg arg ...?\n\t      The method method and its arg'uments determine the exact\n\t      behavior of the command.\tSee section Object methods for the\n\t      detailed specifications.\n\n   OBJECT METHODS\n       objectName destroy\n\t      This method destroys the object it is invoked for.\n\n       objectName import text text ?format?\n\t      This method takes the text and converts it from the specified\n\t      format to the canonical serialization of a parsing expression\n\t      grammar using the import plugin for the format. An error is\n\t      thrown if no plugin could be found for the format.  The\n\t      serialization generated by the conversion process is returned as\n\t      the result of this method.\n\n\t      If no format is specified the method defaults to text.\n\n\t      The specification of what a canonical serialization is can be\n\t      found in the section PEG serialization format.\n\n\t      The plugin has to conform to the interface documented in the\n\t      Parser Tools Import API specification.\n\n       objectName import file path ?format?\n\t      This method is a convenient wrapper around the import text\n\t      method described by the previous item.  It reads the contents of\n\t      the specified file into memory, feeds the result into import\n\t      text and returns the resulting serialization as its own result.\n\n       objectName import object text object text ?format?\n\t      This method is a convenient wrapper around the import text\n\t      method described by the previous item.  It expects that object\n\t      is an object command supporting a deserialize method expecting\n\t      the canonical serialization of a parsing expression grammar.  It\n\t      imports the text using import text and then feeds the resulting\n\t      serialization into the object via deserialize.  This method\n\t      returns the empty string as it result.\n\n       objectName import object file object path ?format?\n\t      This method behaves like import object text, except that it\n\t      reads the text to convert from the specified file instead of\n\t      being given it as argument.\n\n       objectName includes\n\t      This method returns a list containing the currently specified\n\t      paths to use to search for include files when processing input.\n\t      The order of paths in the list corresponds to the order in which\n\t      they are used, from first to last, and also corresponds to the\n\t      order in which they were added to the object.\n\n       objectName include add path\n\t      This methods adds the specified path to the list of paths to use\n\t      to search for include files when processing input. The path is\n\t      added to the end of the list, causing it to be searched after\n\t      all previously added paths. The result of the command is the\n\t      empty string.\n\n\t      The method does nothing if the path is already known.\n\n       objectName include remove path\n\t      This methods removes the specified path from the list of paths\n\t      to use to search for include files when processing input. The\n\t      result of the command is the empty string.\n\n\t      The method does nothing if the path is not known.\n\n       objectName include clear\n\t      This method clears the list of paths to use to search for\n\t      include files when processing input. The result of the command\n\t      is the empty string.\n\nPEG SERIALIZATION FORMAT\n       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize\n       Parsing Expression Grammars as immutable values for transport,\n       comparison, etc.\n\n       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.  While a\n       PEG may have more than one regular serialization only exactly one of\n       them will be canonical.\n\n       regular serialization\n\n\t      [1]    The serialization of any PEG is a nested Tcl dictionary.\n\n\t      [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, pt::grammar::peg, and\n\t\t     its value. This value holds the contents of the grammar.\n\n\t      [3]    The contents of the grammar are a Tcl dictionary holding\n\t\t     the set of nonterminal symbols and the starting\n\t\t     expression. The relevant keys and their values are\n\n\t\t     rules  The value is a Tcl dictionary whose keys are the\n\t\t\t    names of the nonterminal symbols known to the\n\t\t\t    grammar.\n\n\t\t\t    [1]    Each nonterminal symbol may occur only\n\t\t\t\t   once.\n\n\t\t\t    [2]    The empty string is not a legal nonterminal\n\t\t\t\t   symbol.\n\n\t\t\t    [3]    The value for each symbol is a Tcl\n\t\t\t\t   dictionary itself. The relevant keys and\n\t\t\t\t   their values in this dictionary are\n\n\t\t\t\t   is\t  The value is the serialization of\n\t\t\t\t\t  the parsing expression describing\n\t\t\t\t\t  the symbols sentennial structure, as\n\t\t\t\t\t  specified in the section PE\n\t\t\t\t\t  serialization format.\n\n\t\t\t\t   mode   The value can be one of three values\n\t\t\t\t\t  specifying how a parser should\n\t\t\t\t\t  handle the semantic value produced\n\t\t\t\t\t  by the symbol.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  value  The semantic value of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t nonterminal symbol is an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t abstract syntax tree\n\t\t\t\t\t\t consisting of a single node\n\t\t\t\t\t\t node for the nonterminal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t itself, which has the ASTs of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t the symbol's right hand side\n\t\t\t\t\t\t as its children.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  leaf\t The semantic value of the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t nonterminal symbol is an\n\t\t\t\t\t\t abstract syntax tree\n\t\t\t\t\t\t consisting of a single node\n\t\t\t\t\t\t node for the nonterminal,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t without any children. Any\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ASTs generated by the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t symbol's right hand side are\n\t\t\t\t\t\t discarded.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  void\t The nonterminal has no\n\t\t\t\t\t\t semantic value. Any ASTs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t generated by the symbol's\n\t\t\t\t\t\t right hand side are discarded\n\t\t\t\t\t\t (as well).\n\n\t\t     start  The value is the serialization of the start\n\t\t\t    parsing expression of the grammar, as specified in\n\t\t\t    the section PE serialization format.\n\n\t      [4]    The terminal symbols of the grammar are specified\n\t\t     implicitly as the set of all terminal symbols used in the\n\t\t     start expression and on the RHS of the grammar rules.\n\n       canonical serialization\n\t      The canonical serialization of a grammar has the format as\n\t      specified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies\n\t      the constraints below, which make it unique among all the\n\t      possible serializations of this grammar.\n\n\t      [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are\n\t\t     sorted in ascending dictionary order, as generated by\n\t\t     Tcl's builtin command lsort -increasing -dict.\n\n\t      [2]    The string representation of the value is the canonical\n\t\t     representation of a Tcl dictionary. I.e. it does not\n\t\t     contain superfluous whitespace.\n\n   EXAMPLE\n       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions"
