This backend is provided for\n       demonstration purposes only.  The DN of each entry is\n       \"uid=<username>,<suffix>\".  Note that non-base searches scan the the\n       entire passwd file, and are best suited for hosts with small passwd\n       files.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       This slapd.conf option applies to the PASSWD backend database.  That\n       is, it must follow a \"database passwd\" line and come before any\n       subsequent \"backend\" or \"database\" lines.  Other database options are\n       described in the slapd.conf(5) manual page.\n\n       file <filename>\n\t      Specifies an alternate passwd file to use.  The default is\n\t      /etc/passwd.\n\nACCESS CONTROL\n       The passwd backend does not honor any of the access control semantics\n       described in slapd.access(5).  Only read (=r) access to the entry\n       pseudo-attribute and to the other attribute values of the entries\n       returned by the search operation is honored, which is performed by the\n       frontend."
