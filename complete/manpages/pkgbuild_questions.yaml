Although a component package can be installed on its own, it\n     is typically incorporated into a product archive, along with a\n     “distribution” and localized resources, using productbuild(1).\n\n     To create a product archive for submission to the Mac App Store, do not\n     use pkgbuild.  Instead, use productbuild(1) directly.\n\n     pkgbuild has three different modes, as shown in the SYNOPSIS above:\n\n     1.   Package a complete destination root. When you use xcodebuild(1) with\n\t  the install action, the result is a destination root, either under\n\t  /tmp, or in whatever location you specify with the Xcode DSTROOT\n\t  setting. Use the --root option to specify that destination root\n\t  directory to pkgbuild, and the entire contents of the directory tree\n\t  will be included in the output package."

By editing this property list and specifying it\n\t  with --component-plist when you subsequently build the package, you\n\t  can control bundle-specific Installer behavior.\n\n     3.   Package one or more individual bundles. If you don't have a\n\t  destination root, you can use the --component option to specify one\n\t  or more bundles that should be incorporated into the package.  Note\n\t  that only bundles can be specified with --component.\n\nARGUMENTS AND OPTIONS\n     --root root-path\n\t     Package the entire contents of the directory tree at root-path,\n\t     typically a destination root created by xcodebuild(1).\n\n     --component component-path\n\t     The bundle at component-path is added to the package.

    Manpage text:

    BundleOverwriteAction specifies how an existing version of the bundle on
         disk should be handled if the version in the package is installed.
         Despite the name, both upgrade and update do no version checking.
         Conditionally installing based on version is controlled entirely by
         BundleIsVersionChecked. If you specify upgrade, the bundle in the package
         atomically replaces any version on disk; this has the effect of deleting
         old paths that no longer exist in the new version of the bundle.  If you
         specify update, the bundle in the package overwrites the version on disk,
         and any files not contained in the package will be left intact; this is
         appropriate when you are delivering an update-only package.  Another
         effect of update is that the package bundle will not be installed at all
         if there is not already a version on disk; this allows a package to
         deliver an update for an app that the user might have deleted.

         BundlePreInstallScriptPath and BundlePostInstallScriptPath are meaningful
         only if --scripts was used to specify a scripts directory. The paths
         given by these keys must be relative to the scripts directory.

    Manpage text:

    BundleInstallScriptTimeout defines how long the script is able to run
         before the operating system terminates it with SIGKILL.  If this key is
         not specified, the operating system default timeout is chosen, which is
         currently 10 minutes but is also subject to change. This key is only
         respected on versions of macOS newer than macOS 15.0.

         ChildBundles can be used to represent nesting of bundles, but it does not
         change the meaning of RootRelativeBundlePath within lower-level
         dictionaries (i.e. it is always relative to the destination root).  If
         you write a component property list manually, you do not need to use
         ChildBundles at all; you can simply put all bundle dictionaries in the
         top-level array.

    SIGNED PACKAGES
         When creating a package, you can optionally add a digital signature to
         the package.  You will need to have a certificate and corresponding
         private key -- together called an “identity” -- in one of your accessible
         keychains. To add a signature, specify the name of the identity using the
         --sign option. The identity's name is the same as the “Common Name” of
         the certificate.

    Manpage text:

    If you want to search for the identity in a specific keychain, specify
         the path to the keychain file using the --keychain option. Otherwise, the
         default keychain search path is used.

         pkgbuild will embed the signing certificate in the product archive, as
         well as any intermediate certificates that are found in the keychain. If
         you need to embed additional certificates to form a chain of trust
         between the signing certificate and a trusted root certificate on the
         system, use the --cert option to give the Common Name of the intermediate
         certificate. Multiple --cert options may be used to embed multiple
         intermediate certificates.

         The signature can optionally include a trusted timestamp. This is enabled
         by default when signing with a Developer ID identity, but it can be
         enabled explicitly using the --timestamp option. A timestamp server must
         be contacted to embed a trusted timestamp. If you aren't connected to the
         Internet, you can use --timestamp=none to disable timestamps, even for a
         Developer ID identity.
