When used for\n       discovery through the scheduler, the backend will list all printers\n       that respond to a broadcast SNMPv1 query with the \"public\" community\n       name.  Additional queries are then sent to printers that respond in\n       order to determine the correct device URI, make and model, and other\n       information needed for printing.\n\n       In the first form, the SNMP backend is run directly by the user to look\n       up the device URI and other information when you have an IP address or\n       hostname.  This can be used for programs that need to configure print\n       queues where the user has supplied an address but nothing else."

    Manpage text:

    In the second form, the SNMP backend is run indirectly using the
           lpinfo(8) command.  The output provides all printers detected via SNMP
           on the configured broadcast addresses.  Note: no broadcast addresses
           are configured by default.

    ENVIRONMENT
           The DebugLevel value can be overridden using the CUPS_DEBUG_LEVEL
           environment variable.  The MaxRunTime value can be overridden using the
           CUPS_MAX_RUN_TIME environment variable.

    FILES
           The SNMP backend reads the /etc/cups/snmp.conf configuration file, if
           present, to set the default broadcast address, community name, and
           logging level.

    NOTES
           The CUPS SNMP backend is deprecated and will no longer be supported in
           a future version of CUPS.

    CONFORMING TO
           The CUPS SNMP backend uses the information from the Host, Printer, and
           Port Monitor MIBs along with some vendor private MIBs and intelligent
           port probes to determine the correct device URI and make and model for
           each printer.
