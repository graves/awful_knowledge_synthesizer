    NAME
           perlop - Perl operators and precedence

    DESCRIPTION
           In Perl, the operator determines what operation is performed,
           independent of the type of the operands.  For example "$x + $y" is
           always a numeric addition, and if $x or $y do not contain numbers, an
           attempt is made to convert them to numbers first.

           This is in contrast to many other dynamic languages, where the
           operation is determined by the type of the first argument.  It also
           means that Perl has two versions of some operators, one for numeric and
           one for string comparison.  For example "$x == $y" compares two numbers
           for equality, and "$x eq $y" compares two strings.

           There are a few exceptions though: "x" can be either string repetition
           or list repetition, depending on the type of the left operand, and "&",
           "|", "^" and "~" can be either string or numeric bit operations.

       Operator Precedence and Associativity
           Operator precedence and associativity work in Perl more or less like
           they do in mathematics.

It is as if the expression were\n       written \"2 + (4 * 5)\", not \"(2 + 4) * 5\". So the expression yields \"2 +\n       20 == 22\", rather than \"6 * 5 == 30\".\n\n       Operator associativity defines what happens if a sequence of the same\n       operators is used one after another: usually that they will be grouped\n       at the left or the right. For example, in \"9 - 3 - 2\", subtraction is\n       left associative, so \"9 - 3\" is grouped together as the left-hand\n       operand of the second subtraction, rather than \"3 - 2\" being grouped\n       together as the right-hand operand of the first subtraction.

    Manpage text:

    For simple operators that evaluate all their operands and then combine
           the values in some way, precedence and associativity (and parentheses)
           imply some ordering requirements on those combining operations. For
           example, in "2 + 4 * 5", the grouping implied by precedence means that
           the multiplication of 4 and 5 must be performed before the addition of
           2 and 20, simply because the result of that multiplication is required
           as one of the operands of the addition. But the order of operations is
           not fully determined by this: in "2 * 2 + 4 * 5" both multiplications
           must be performed before the addition, but the grouping does not say
           anything about the order in which the two multiplications are
           performed. In fact Perl has a general rule that the operands of an
           operator are evaluated in left-to-right order. A few operators such as
           "&&=" have special evaluation rules that can result in an operand not
           being evaluated at all; in general, the top-level operator in an
           expression has control of operand evaluation.

    Manpage text:

    Some comparison operators, as their associativity, chain with some
           operators of the same precedence (but never with operators of different
           precedence).  This chaining means that each comparison is performed on
           the two arguments surrounding it, with each interior argument taking
           part in two comparisons, and the comparison results are implicitly
           ANDed.  Thus "$x < $y <= $z" behaves exactly like
           "$x < $y && $y <= $z", assuming that "$y" is as simple a scalar as it
           looks.  The ANDing short-circuits just like "&&" does, stopping the
           sequence of comparisons as soon as one yields false.

           In a chained comparison, each argument expression is evaluated at most
           once, even if it takes part in two comparisons, but the result of the
           evaluation is fetched for each comparison.  (It is not evaluated at all
           if the short-circuiting means that it's not required for any
           comparisons.)  This matters if the computation of an interior argument
           is expensive or non-deterministic.  For example,

    '\\' =~ q'\\';

           is not ok, as the regex engine will end up trying to compile the
           pattern "\", which it will consider a syntax error.

           Binary "!~" is just like "=~" except the return value is negated in the
           logical sense.

           Binary "!~" with a non-destructive substitution ("s///r") or
           transliteration ("y///r") is a syntax error.

       Multiplicative Operators
           Binary "*" multiplies two numbers.

           Binary "/" divides two numbers.

           Binary "%" is the modulo operator, which computes the division
           remainder of its first argument with respect to its second argument.
           Given integer operands $m and $n: If $n is positive, then "$m % $n" is
           $m minus the largest multiple of $n less than or equal to $m.  If $n is
           negative, then "$m % $n" is $m minus the smallest multiple of $n that
           is not less than $m (that is, the result will be less than or equal to
           zero).  If the operands $m and $n are floating point values and the
           absolute value of $n (that is "abs($n)") is less than "(UV_MAX + 1)",
           only the integer portion of $m and $n will be used in the operation
           (Note: here "UV_MAX" means the maximum of the unsigned integer type).
           If the absolute value of the right operand ("abs($n)") is greater than
           or equal to "(UV_MAX + 1)", "%" computes the floating-point remainder
           $r in the equation "($r = $m - $i*$n)" where $i is a certain integer
           that makes $r have the same sign as the right operand $n (not as the
           left operand $m like C function "fmod()") and the absolute value less
           than that of $n.  Note that when "use integer" is in scope, "%" gives
           you direct access to the modulo operator as implemented by your C
           compiler.  This operator is not as well defined for negative operands,
           but it will execute faster.

    Regarding precedence, the filetest operators, like "-f", "-M", etc. are
           treated like named unary operators, but they don't follow this

       Relational Operators
           Perl operators that return true or false generally return values that
           can be safely used as numbers.  For example, the relational operators
           in this section and the equality operators in the next one return 1 for
           true and a special version of the defined empty string, "", which
           counts as a zero but is exempt from warnings about improper numeric
           conversions, just as "0 but true" is.

           Binary "<" returns true if the left argument is numerically less than
           the right argument.

           Binary ">" returns true if the left argument is numerically greater

    It is also unique in that all other Perl operators impose a context
           (usually string or numeric context) on their operands, autoconverting
           those operands to those imposed contexts.  In contrast, smartmatch
           infers contexts from the actual types of its operands and uses that
           type information to select a suitable comparison mechanism.

           The "~~" operator compares its operands "polymorphically", determining
           how to compare them according to their actual types (numeric, string,
           array, hash, etc.).  Like the equality operators with which it shares
           the same precedence, "~~" returns 1 for true and "" for false.  It is
           often best read aloud as "in", "inside of", or "is contained in",
           because the left operand is often looked for inside the right operand.
           That makes the order of the operands to the smartmatch operand often
           opposite that of the regular match operator.  In other words, the
           "smaller" thing is usually placed in the left operand and the larger
           one in the right.

    Manpage text:

    C-style Logical Or
           Binary "||" performs a short-circuit logical OR operation.  That is, if
           the left operand is true, the right operand is not even evaluated.
           Scalar or list context propagates down to the right operand if it is
           evaluated.

       Logical Defined-Or
           Although it has no direct equivalent in C, Perl's "//" operator is
           related to its C-style "or".  In fact, it's exactly the same as "||",
           except that it tests the left hand side's definedness instead of its
           truth.  Thus, "EXPR1 // EXPR2" returns the value of "EXPR1" if it's
           defined, otherwise, the value of "EXPR2" is returned.  ("EXPR1" is
           evaluated in scalar context, "EXPR2" in the context of "//" itself).
           Usually, this is the same result as "defined(EXPR1) ? EXPR1 : EXPR2"
           (except that the ternary-operator form can be used as a lvalue, while
           "EXPR1 // EXPR2" cannot).  This is very useful for providing default
           values for variables.  If you actually want to test if at least one of
           $x and $y is defined, use "defined($x // $y)".

(For example, in a regular expression it may be confused\n\t   with a backreference; see \"Octal escapes\" in perlrebackslash.)\n\t   Starting in Perl 5.14, you may use \"\\o{}\" instead, which avoids all\n\t   these problems.  Otherwise, it is best to use this construct only\n\t   for ordinals \"\\077\" and below, remembering to pad to the left with\n\t   zeros to make three digits.\tFor larger ordinals, either use\n\t   \"\\o{}\", or convert to something else, such as to hex and use\n\t   \"\\N{U+}\" (which is portable between platforms with different\n\t   character sets) or \"\\x{}\" instead.\n\n       [8] Several constructs above specify a character by a number.  That\n\t   number gives the character's position in the character set encoding\n\t   (indexed from 0).  This is called synonymously its ordinal, code\n\t   position, or code point.  Perl works on platforms that have a\n\t   native encoding currently of either ASCII/Latin1 or EBCDIC, each of\n\t   which allow specification of 256 characters.  In general, if the\n\t   number is 255 (0xFF, 0377) or below, Perl interprets this in the\n\t   platform's native encoding.\tIf the number is 256 (0x100, 0400) or\n\t   above, Perl interprets it as a Unicode code point and the result is\n\t   the corresponding Unicode character.  For example \"\\x{50}\" and\n\t   \"\\o{120}\" both are the number 80 in decimal, which is less than\n\t   256, so the number is interpreted in the native character set\n\t   encoding.  In ASCII the character in the 80th position (indexed\n\t   from 0) is the letter \"P\", and in EBCDIC it is the ampersand symbol\n\t   \"&\".  \"\\x{100}\" and \"\\o{400}\" are both 256 in decimal, so the\n\t   number is interpreted as a Unicode code point no matter what the\n\t   native encoding is.\tThe name of the character in the 256th\n\t   position (indexed by 0) in Unicode is \"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH\n\t   MACRON\"."

You can force Perl to skip the test\n\t       and never recompile by adding a \"/o\" (which stands for \"once\")\n\t       after the trailing delimiter.  Once upon a time, Perl would\n\t       recompile regular expressions unnecessarily, and this modifier\n\t       was useful to tell it not to do so, in the interests of speed.\n\t       But now, the only reasons to use \"/o\" are one of:"

    Manpage text:

    This section hopes to clarify how Perl handles quoted constructs.
           Although the most common reason to learn this is to unravel
           labyrinthine regular expressions, because the initial steps of parsing
           are the same for all quoting operators, they are all discussed
           together.

           The most important Perl parsing rule is the first one discussed below:
           when processing a quoted construct, Perl first finds the end of that
           construct, then interprets its contents.  If you understand this rule,
           you may skip the rest of this section on the first reading.  The other
           rules are likely to contradict the user's expectations much less
           frequently than this first one.

           Some passes discussed below are performed concurrently, but because
           their results are the same, we consider them individually.  For
           different quoting constructs, Perl performs different numbers of
           passes, from one to four, but these passes are always performed in the
           same order.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlop`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nFinding the end\n\t   The first pass is finding the end of the quoted construct.  This\n\t   results in saving to a safe location a copy of the text (between\n\t   the starting and ending delimiters), normalized as necessary to\n\t   avoid needing to know what the original delimiters were.\n\n\t   If the construct is a here-doc, the ending delimiter is a line that\n\t   has a terminating string as the content.  Therefore \"<<EOF\" is\n\t   terminated by \"EOF\" immediately followed by \"\\n\" and starting from\n\t   the first column of the terminating line.  When searching for the\n\t   terminating line of a here-doc, nothing is skipped.\tIn other\n\t   words, lines after the here-doc syntax are compared with the\n\t   terminating string line by line.\n\n\t   For the constructs except here-docs, single characters are used as\n\t   starting and ending delimiters.  If the starting delimiter is an\n\t   opening punctuation (that is \"(\", \"[\", \"{\", or \"<\"), the ending\n\t   delimiter is the corresponding closing punctuation (that is \")\",\n\t   \"]\", \"}\", or \">\").  If the starting delimiter is an unpaired\n\t   character like \"/\" or a closing punctuation, the ending delimiter\n\t   is the same as the starting delimiter.  Therefore a \"/\" terminates\n\t   a \"qq//\" construct, while a \"]\" terminates both \"qq[]\" and \"qq]]\"\n\t   constructs."

For example, while\n\t   searching for a closing \"]\" paired with the opening \"[\",\n\t   combinations of \"\\\\\", \"\\]\", and \"\\[\" are all skipped, and nested\n\t   \"[\" and \"]\" are skipped as well.  However, when backslashes are\n\t   used as the delimiters (like \"qq\\\\\" and \"tr\\\\\\\"), nothing is\n\t   skipped.  During the search for the end, backslashes that escape\n\t   delimiters or other backslashes are removed (exactly speaking, they\n\t   are not copied to the safe location).\n\n\t   For constructs with three-part delimiters (\"s///\", \"y///\", and\n\t   \"tr///\"), the search is repeated once more.\tIf the first delimiter\n\t   is not an opening punctuation, the three delimiters must be the\n\t   same, such as \"s!!!\" and \"tr)))\", in which case the second\n\t   delimiter terminates the left part and starts the right part at\n\t   once.  If the left part is delimited by bracketing punctuation\n\t   (that is \"()\", \"[]\", \"{}\", or \"<>\"), the right part needs another\n\t   pair of delimiters such as \"s(){}\" and \"tr[]//\".  In these cases,\n\t   whitespace and comments are allowed between the two parts, although\n\t   the comment must follow at least one whitespace character;\n\t   otherwise a character expected as the start of the comment may be\n\t   regarded as the starting delimiter of the right part."

    Manpage text:

    The filehandles STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR are predefined.  (The
           filehandles "stdin", "stdout", and "stderr" will also work except in
           packages, where they would be interpreted as local identifiers rather
           than global.)  Additional filehandles may be created with the "open()"
           function, amongst others.  See perlopentut and "open" in perlfunc for
           details on this.

           If a "<FILEHANDLE>" is used in a context that is looking for a list, a
           list comprising all input lines is returned, one line per list element.
           It's easy to grow to a rather large data space this way, so use with
           care.

           "<FILEHANDLE>"  may also be spelled "readline(*FILEHANDLE)".  See
           "readline" in perlfunc.

           The null filehandle "<>" (sometimes called the diamond operator) is
           special: it can be used to emulate the behavior of sed and awk, and any
           other Unix filter program that takes a list of filenames, doing the
           same to each line of input from all of them.  Input from "<>" comes
           either from standard input, or from each file listed on the command
           line.  Here's how it works: the first time "<>" is evaluated, the @ARGV
           array is checked, and if it is empty, $ARGV[0] is set to "-", which
           when opened gives you standard input.  The @ARGV array is then
           processed as a list of filenames.  The loop

An\n       inner BLOCK may countermand this by saying\n\n\t   no integer;\n\n       which lasts until the end of that BLOCK.  Note that this doesn't mean\n       everything is an integer, merely that Perl will use integer operations\n       for arithmetic, comparison, and bitwise operators.  For example, even\n       under \"use integer\", if you take the sqrt(2), you'll still get\n       1.4142135623731 or so.\n\n       Used on numbers, the bitwise operators (\"&\" \"|\" \"^\" \"~\" \"<<\" \">>\")\n       always produce integral results.  (But see also \"Bitwise String\n       Operators\".)  However, \"use integer\" still has meaning for them.  By\n       default, their results are interpreted as unsigned integers, but if\n       \"use integer\" is in effect, their results are interpreted as signed\n       integers.  For example, \"~0\" usually evaluates to a large integral\n       value.  However, \"use integer; ~0\" is \"-1\" on two's-complement\n       machines."

For rounding to a certain number of\n       digits, \"sprintf()\" or \"printf()\" is usually the easiest route.\tSee\n       perlfaq4.\n\n       Floating-point numbers are only approximations to what a mathematician\n       would call real numbers.  There are infinitely more reals than floats,\n       so some corners must be cut.  For example:\n\n\t   printf \"%.20g\\n\", 123456789123456789;\n\t   #\t    produces 123456789123456784\n\n       Testing for exact floating-point equality or inequality is not a good\n       idea.  Here's a (relatively expensive) work-around to compare whether\n       two floating-point numbers are equal to a particular number of decimal\n       places.\tSee Knuth, volume II, for a more robust treatment of this\n       topic.\n\n\t   sub fp_equal {\n\t       my ($X, $Y, $POINTS) = @_;\n\t       my ($tX, $tY);\n\t       $tX = sprintf(\"%.${POINTS}g\", $X);\n\t       $tY = sprintf(\"%.${POINTS}g\", $Y);\n\t       return $tX eq $tY;\n\t   }"
