It\n     can be used to get or set a variable.  It can also be used to print all\n     of the variables or set a list of variables from a file.  Changes to\n     NVRAM variables are only saved by clean restart or shutdown.\n\n     In principle, name can be any string.  In practice, not all strings will\n     be accepted.  Some variables require administrator privilege to get or\n     set.\n\n     The given value must match the data type required for name.  Binary data\n     can be set using the %xx notation, where xx is the hex value of the byte.\n     The type for new variables is always binary data.\n\nOPTIONS\n     -d name\t\tDeletes the named firmware variable.\n\n     -r name\t\tDeletes the named firmware variable and returns error\n\t\t\tcode if any."
