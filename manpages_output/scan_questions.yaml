Each varName gives the name of a\n       variable; when a substring is scanned from string that matches a\n       conversion specifier, the substring is assigned to the corresponding\n       variable.  If no varName variables are specified, then scan works in an\n       inline manner, returning the data that would otherwise be stored in the\n       variables as a list.

    Manpage text:

    DETAILS ON SCANNING
           Scan operates by scanning string and format together.  If the next
           character in format is a blank or tab then it matches any number of
           white space characters in string (including zero).  Otherwise, if it is
           not a % character then it must match the next character of string.
           When a % is encountered in format, it indicates the start of a
           conversion specifier.  A conversion specifier contains up to four
           fields after the %: a XPG3 position specifier (or a * to indicate the
           converted value is to be discarded instead of assigned to any
           variable); a number indicating a maximum substring width; a size
           modifier; and a conversion character.  All of these fields are optional
           except for the conversion character.  The fields that are present must
           appear in the order given above.

           When scan finds a conversion specifier in format, it first skips any
           white-space characters in string (unless the conversion character is [
           or c).  Then it converts the next input characters according to the
           conversion specifier and stores the result in the variable given by the
           next argument to scan.
