It consists of an empty line, then\n     a line “TZ=string” where string is a double-quoted string giving the\n     timezone, a second line “\tinterval” describing the time interval before\n     the first transition if any, and zero or more following lines “date time\n     interval”, one line for each transition time and following interval.\n     Fields are separated by single tabs.\n\n     Dates are in ‘yyyy - mm - dd’ format and times are in 24-hour ‘hh : mm :\n     ss’ format where ‘hh <24’.  Times are in local time immediately after the\n     transition.  A time interval description consists of a UT offset in\n     signed ‘± hhmmss’ format, a time zone abbreviation, and an isdst flag.\n     An abbreviation that equals the UT offset is omitted; other abbreviations\n     are double-quoted strings unless they consist of one or more alphabetic\n     characters.  An isdst flag is omitted for standard time, and otherwise is\n     a decimal integer that is unsigned and positive (typically 1) for\n     daylight saving time and negative for unknown."
