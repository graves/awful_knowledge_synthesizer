It provides fault tolerance with extreme\n       scalability, along with a degree of SQL compatibility.\n\n       This backend is designed to store LDAP information using tables that\n       are also visible from SQL. It uses a higher level SQL API for creating\n       these tables, while using the low level NDB API for storing and\n       retrieving the data within these tables. The NDB Cluster engine allows\n       data to be partitioned across multiple data nodes, and this backend\n       allows multiple slapd instances to operate against a given database\n       concurrently.\n\n       The general approach is to use distinct tables for each LDAP object\n       class.  Entries comprised of multiple object classes will have their\n       data spread across multiple tables. The data tables use a 64 bit\n       entryID as their primary key. The DIT hierarchy is maintained in a\n       separate table, which maps DNs to entryIDs.\n\n       This backend is experimental. While intended to be a general-purpose\n       backend, it is currently missing a number of common LDAP features.  See\n       the TODO file in the source directory for details.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       These slapd.conf options apply to the ndb backend database.  That is,\n       they must follow a \"database ndb\" line and come before any subsequent\n       \"backend\" or \"database\" lines.  Other database options are described in\n       the slapd.conf(5) manual page."

If a length constraint was\n\t      specified in the attribute's LDAP schema definition, that value\n\t      will be used by default. If the schema didn't specify a\n\t      constraint, the default is 128 bytes.

Attribute sets should be defined for any\n\t      attributes that are used in multiple unrelated object classes,\n\t      i.e., classes that are not connected by a simple inheritance\n\t      chain."
