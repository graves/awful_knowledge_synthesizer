For each network a single line should be\n     present with the following information:\n\n\t   official network name\n\t   network number\n\t   aliases\n\n     Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.  A\n     ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of\n     the line are not interpreted by routines which search the file.  This\n     file is normally created from the official network data base maintained\n     at the Network Information Control Center (NIC), though local changes may\n     be required to bring it up to date regarding unofficial aliases and/or\n     unknown networks.\n\n     Network number may be specified in the conventional ``.''\t(dot) notation\n     using the inet_network(3) routine from the Internet address manipulation\n     library, inet(3).\tNetwork names may contain any printable character\n     other than a field delimiter, newline, or comment character."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the networks file?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you format a line in the networks file to specify the network name 'example-net', with network number 128.4.0, and an alias 'exnet'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain how the networks file is typically updated with official network data from the NIC?
