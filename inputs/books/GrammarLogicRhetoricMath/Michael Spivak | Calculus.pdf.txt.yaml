    PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
    
    Every aspect of this book was influenced by the desire to present calculus not
    merely as a prelude to but as the first real encounter with mathematics. Since
    the foundations of analysis provided the arena in which modern modes of math-
    ematical thinking developed, calculus ought to be the place in which to expect,
    rather than avoid, the strengthening of insight with logic. In addition to devel-
    oping the students' intuition about the beautiful concepts of analysis, it is surely
    equally important to persuade them that precision and rigor are neither deterrents
    to intuition, nor ends in themselves, but the natural medium in which to formulate
    and think about mathematical questions.
    
    This goal implies a view of mathematics which, in a sense, the entire book
    attempts to defend. No matter how well particular topics may be developed, the
    goals of this book will be realized only if it succeeds as a whole. For this reason, it
    would be of little value merely to list the topics covered, or to mention pedagogical
    practices and other innovations. Even the cursory glance customarily bestowed on
    new calculus texts will probably tell more than any such extended advertisement,
    and teachers with strong feelings about particular aspects of calculus will know just
    where to look to see if this book fulfills their requirements.
  - |-
    A few features do require explicit comment, however. Of the twenty-nine chapters in the book, two (starred) chapters are optional, and the three chapters comprising Part V have been included only for the benefit of those students who might want to examine on their own a construction of the real numbers. Moreover, the appendices to Chapters 3 and 11 also contain optional material.
    
    The order of the remaining chapters is intentionally quite inflexible, since the purpose of the book is to present calculus as the evolution of one idea, not as a collection of "topics." Since the most exciting concepts of calculus do not appear until Part III, it should be pointed out that Parts I and II will probably require less time than their length suggests—although the entire book covers a one-year course, the chapters are not meant to be covered at any uniform rate. A rather natural dividing point does occur between Parts II and III, so it is possible to reach differentiation and integration even more quickly by treating Part II very briefly, perhaps returning later for a more detailed treatment. This arrangement corresponds to the traditional organization of most calculus courses, but I feel that it will only diminish the value of the book for students who have seen a small amount of calculus previously, and for bright students with a reasonable background.
    
    The problems have been designed with this particular audience in mind. They range from straightforward, but not overly simple, exercises which develop basic techniques and test understanding of concepts, to problems of considerable difficulty and, I hope, of comparable interest. There are about 625 problems in all. Those which emphasize manipulations usually contain many examples, numbered

    With small Roman numerals, while small letters are used to label interrelated parts
    in other problems. Some indication of relative difficulty is provided by a system of
    starring and double starring, but there are so many criteria for judging difficulty,
    and so many hints have been provided, especially for harder problems, that this
    guide is not completely reliable. Many problems are so difficult, especially if the
    hints are not consulted, that the best of students will probably have to attempt only
    those which especially interest them; from the less difficult problems it should be
    easy to select a portion which will keep a good class busy, but not frustrated. The
    answer section contains solutions to about half the examples from an assortment
    of problems that should provide a good test of technical competence. A separate
    answer book contains the solutions of the other parts of these problems, and of all
    the other problems as well. Finally, there is a Suggested Reading list, to which the
    problems often refer, and a glossary of symbols.
    
    I am grateful for the opportunity to mention the many people to whom I owe my
    thanks. Jane Bjorkgren performed prodigious feats of typing that compensated for
    my fitful production of the manuscript. Richard Serkey helped collect the material
    which provides historical sidelights in the problems, and Richard Weiss supplied
    the answers appearing in the back of the book. I am especially grateful to my
    friends Michael Freeman, Jay Goldman, Anthony Philips, and Robert Wells for
    the care with which they read, and the relentlessness with which they criticized, a
    preliminary version of the book. Needles to say, they are not responsible for the
    deficiencies which remain, especially since I sometimes rejected suggestions which
    would have made the book appear suitable for a larger group of students. I must
    express my admiration for the editors and staff of W. A. Benjamin, Inc., who were
    always eager to increase the appeal of the book, while recognizing the audience
    for which it was intended.
  - |-
    The inadequacies which preliminary editions always involve were gallantly endured by a rugged group of freshmen in the honors mathematics course at Brandeis University during the academic year 1965-1966. About half of this course was devoted to algebra and topology, while the other half covered calculus, with the preliminary edition as the text. It is almost obligatory in such circumstances to report that the preliminary version was a gratifying success. This is always safe—after all, the class is unlikely to rise up in a body and protest publicly—but the students themselves, it seems to me, deserve the right to assign credit for the thoroughness with which they absorbed an impressive amount of mathematics. I am content to hope that some other students will be able to use the book to such good purpose, and with such enthusiasm.

    PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
    
    I have often been told that the title of this book should really be something like "An Introduction to Analysis," because the book is usually used in courses where the students have already learned the mechanical aspects of calculus—such courses are standard in Europe, and they are becoming more common in the United States. After thirteen years it seems too late to change the title, but other changes, in addition to the correction of numerous misprints and mistakes, seemed called for. There are now separate Appendices for many topics that were previously shghted: polar coordinates, uniform continuity, parameterized curves, Riemann sums, and the use of integrals for evaluating lengths, volumes and surface areas. A few topics, like manipulations with power series, have been discussed more thoroughly in the text, and there are also more problems on these topics, while other topics, like Newton's method and the trapezoid rule and Simpson's rule, have been developed in the problems. There are in all about 160 new problems, many of which are intermediate in difficulty between the few routine problems at the beginning of each chapter and the more difficult ones that occur later.
  - |-
    Most of the new problems are the work of Ted Shifrm. Frederick Gordon
    pointed out several serious mistakes in the original problems, and supplied some
    non-trivial corrections, as well as the neat proof of Theorem 12-2, which took
    two Lemmas and two pages in the first edition. Joseph Lipman also told me
    of this proof, together with the similar trick for the proof of the last theorem in
    the Appendix to Chapter 11, which went unproved in the first edition. Roy O.
    Davies told me the trick for Problem 11-66, which previously was proved only in
    Problem 20-8 [21-8 in the third edition], and Marina Ratner suggested several
    interesting problems, especially ones on uniform continuity and infinite series. ‘To
    all these people go my thanks, and the hope that in the process of fashioning the
    new edition their contributions weren't too badly botched.

    PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION
    
    The most significant change in this third edition is the inclusion of a new (starred)
    Chapter 7 on planetary motion, in which calculus is employed for a substantial
    physics problem.
    
    In preparation for this, the old Appendix to Chapter 4 has been replaced by
    three Appendices: the first two cover vectors and conic sections, while polar coor-
    dinates are now deferred until the third Appendix, which also discusses the polar
    coordinate equations of the conic sections. Moreover, the Appendix to Chapter 12
    has been extended to treat vector operations on vector-valued curves.
    
    Another large change is merely a rearrangement of old material: "The Cos-
    mopolitan Integral," previously a second Appendix to Chapter 13, is now an
    Appendix to the chapter on "Integration in Elementary Terms" (previously Chap-
    ter 18, now Chapter 19); moreover, those problems from that chapter which used
    the material from that Appendix now appear as problems in the newly placed
    Appendix.
    
    A few other changes and renumbering of Problems result from corrections, and
    elimination of incorrect problems.
  - |-
    I was both startled and somewhat dismayed when I realized that after allowing 13 years to elapse between the first and second editions of the book, I have allowed another 14 years to elapse before this third edition. During this time, it seems to have accumulated a not-so-short list of corrections, but no longer have the original communications, and therefore cannot properly thank the various individuals involved (who by now have probably lost interest anyway). I have had time to make only a few changes to the Suggested Reading, which after all these years probably requires a complete revision; this will have to wait until the next edition, which I hope to make in a more timely fashion.
    
    MICHAEL SPIVAK
    
    PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION
    
    Promises, promises! In the preface to the third edition I noted that it was 13 years between the first and second editions, and then another 14 years before the third, expressing the hope that the next edition would appear sooner. Well, here it is another 14 years later before the fourth, and presumably final, edition.
    
    Although small changes have been made to some material, especially in Chapters 5 and 20, this edition differs mainly in the introduction of additional problems, a complete update of the Suggested Reading, and the correction of numerous errors. These have been brought to my attention over the years by, among others, Nils von Barth; Philip Loewen; Fernando Mejias; Lance Muler, who provided a long list, particularly for the answer book; and Michael Maltenfort, who provided an amazingly extensive list of misprints, errors, and criticisms.
  - |-
    Most of all, however, I am indebted to my friend ‘Ted Shifrin, who has been
    using the book for the text in his renowned course at the University of Georgia
    for all these years, and who prodded and helped me to finally make this needed
    revision. I must also thank the students in his course this last academic year, who
    served as guinea pigs for the new edition, resulting, in particular, in the current
    proof in Problem 8-20 for the Rising Sun Lemma, far simpler than Reisz's original
    proof, or even the proof in [38] of the Suggested Reading, which itself has now
    been updated considerably, again with great help from Ted.

    CHAPTER
    
    BASIC PROPERTIES OF NUMBERS
    
    The title of this chapter expresses in a few words the mathematical knowledge
    required to read this book. In fact, this short chapter is simply an explanation of
    what is meant by the "basic properties of numbers," all of which—addition and
    multiplication, subtraction and division, solutions of equations and inequalities,
    factoring and other algebraic manipulations—are already familiar to us. Nevertheless, this chapter is not a review. Despite the familiarity of the subject, the
    survey we are about to undertake will probably seem quite novel; it does not aim
    to present an extended review of old material, but to condense this knowledge
    into a few simple and obvious properties of numbers. Some may even seem too
    obvious to mention, but a surprising number of diverse and important facts turn
    out to be consequences of the ones we shall emphasize.
  - |-
    Of the twelve properties which we shall study in this chapter, the first nine are
    concerned with the fundamental operations of addition and multiplication. For
    the moment we consider only addition: this operation is performed on a pair
    of numbers—the sum a + 5b exists for any two given numbers a and b (which
    may possibly be the same number, of course). It might seem reasonable to regard
    addition as an operation which can be performed on several numbers at once, and
    consider the sum a; + --- +a, of nm numbers aj,..., a, as a basic concept. It 1s
    more convenient, however, to consider addition of pairs of numbers only, and to
    define other sums in terms of sums of this type. For the sum of three numbers
    a, b, and c, this may be done in two different ways. One can first add b and c,
    obtaining b+ c, and then add a to this number, obtaining a + (b+); or one can
    first add a and 5b, and then add the sum a + b to c, obtaining (a+ b)+c. Of
    course, the two compound sums obtained are equal, and this fact is the very first
    
    property we shall list:
    
    (Pl) If a,b, and c are any numbers, then
    
    a+(b+c)=(at+b)+c.
    
    The statement of this property clearly renders a separate concept of the sum of
    three numbers superfluous; we simply agree that a + b+ c denotes the number
    a+(b+c) = (a+b)+c. Addition of four numbers requires similar, though slightly
    more involved, considerations. ‘The symbol a + b + c + d is defined to mean
    
    (1) ((a+b)+c)+d,
    or (2) (a+(b+c))+d,
    or (3) a+((b+c)+ 4),
    or (4) a+(b4+(c+d)),
    or (5) (a+b)+(c+ 4).
    
    4 Prologue
    
    This definition 1s unambiguous since these numbers are all equal. Fortunately, this
    fact need not be listed separately, since it follows from the property P1 already
    listed. For example, we know from PI that
    
    (a+b)+c=a+(b+ 0),

    and it follows immediately that (1) and (2) are equal. The equality of (2) and (3)
    is a direct consequence of Pl, although this may not be apparent at first sight
    (one must let b+ c play the role of b in PI, and d the role of c). The equalities
    (3) = (4) = (5) are also simple to prove.
    
    It is probably obvious that an appeal to P! will also suffice to prove the equality
    of the 14 possible ways of summing five numbers, but it may not be so clear how we
    can reasonably arrange a proof that this is so without actually listing these 14 sums.
    Such a procedure is feasible, but would soon cease to be if we considered collections
    of six, seven, or more numbers; it would be totally inadequate to prove the equality
    of all possible sums of an arbitrary finite collection of numbers aj,...,a,. ‘This
    fact may be taken for granted, but for those who would like to worry about the
    proof (and it is worth worrying about once) a reasonable approach is outlined in
    Problem 24. Henceforth, we shall usually make a tacit appeal to the results of this
    problem and write sums a; +---+ a, with a blithe disregard for the arrangement
    of parentheses.
    
    The number 0 has one property so important that we list it next:
    
    (P2) If ais any number, then
    a+O0=O0+a=a.
    
    An important role is also played by O in the third property of our list:
    
    (P3) For every number a, there 1s a number —a such that
    
    a+(—a) =(-a)+a=0.
    
    Property P2 ought to represent a distinguishing characteristic of the number 0,
    and it is comforting to note that we are already in a position to prove this. Indeed,
    if a number x satisfies
    
    atx=a
    
    for any one number a, then x = 0 (and consequently this equation also holds for all
    numbers a). The proof of this assertion involves nothing more than subtracting a
    from both sides of the equation, in other words, adding —a to both sides; as the
    following detailed proof shows, all three properties P!1—P3 must be used to justify
    this operation.
  - |-
    If a + x = a,
    then (-a) + (a + x) = (-a) + a = 0;
    hence ((-a) + a) + x = 0;
    hence 0 + x = 0;
    hence x = 0.
    
    1. Basic Properties of Numbers 5
    
    As we have just hinted, it is convenient to regard subtraction as an operation
    derived from addition: we consider a - b to be an abbreviation for a + (-b). It
    is then possible to find the solution of certain simple equations by a series of steps
    (each justified by P1, P2, or P3) similar to the ones just presented for the equation
    a + x = a. For example:
    
    If x + 3 = 5,
    then (x + 3) + (-3) = 5 + (-3);
    hence x + (3 + (-3)) = 5 - 3 = 2;
    hence x + 0 = 2;
    hence x = 2.
    
    Naturally, such elaborate solutions are of interest only until you become convinced
    that they can always be supplied. In practice, it is usually just a waste of time to
    solve an equation by indicating so explicitly the reliance on properties P1, P2, and
    P3 (or any of the further properties we shall list).
    
    Only one other property of addition remains to be listed. When considering the
    sums of three numbers a, b, and c, only two sums were mentioned: (a + b) + c
    and a + (b + c). Actually, several other arrangements are obtained if the order of
    a, b, and c is changed. That these sums are all equal depends on
    
    (P4) If a and b are any numbers, then
    a + b = b + a.
  - |-
    The statement of P4 is meant to emphasize that although the operation of ad-
    dition of pairs of numbers might conceivably depend on the order of the two
    numbers, in fact it does not. It is helpful to remember that not all operations are
    so well behaved. For example, subtraction does not have this property: usually
    a—b+#b—a. In passing we might ask just when a — b does equal b — a, and it
    is amusing to discover how powerless we are if we rely only on properties P1—P4
    to justify our manipulations. Algebra of the most elementary variety shows that
    a — b = b—a only when a = b. Nevertheless, it 1s impossible to derive this fact
    from properties P1—P4; it 1s instructive to examine the elementary algebra care-
    fully and determine which step(s) cannot be justified by PI—P4. We will indeed
    be able to justify all steps in detail when a few more properties are listed. Oddly
    enough, however, the crucial property involves multiplication.
    
    The basic properties of multiplication are fortunately so similar to those for ad-
    dition that little comment will be needed; both the meaning and the consequences
    should be clear. (As in elementary algebra, the product of a and b will be denoted
    by a-b, or simply ab.)
    
    (P5) If a,b, and c are any numbers, then
    
    a-(b-c)=(a-b)-c.
    
    (P6) If ais any number, then
    
    6 Prologue
    
    Moreover, | 4 0.
    
    (The assertion that | #4 O may seem a strange fact to list, but we have to
    list it, because there is no way it could possibly be proved on the basis of the
    other properties listed—these properties would all hold if there were only one
    number, namely, 0.)
    
    (P7) For every number a ¥ 0, there is a number a™! such that
    
    (P8) If a and Db are any numbers, then
    
    a-b=b.-a.
  - |-
    One detail which deserves emphasis is the appearance of the condition a 4 0 in P7. ‘This condition is quite necessary; since 0-b = 0 for all numbers b, there is no number 07! satisfying 0-07! = 1. This restriction has an important consequence for division. Just as subtraction was defined in terms of addition, so division is defined in terms of multiplication: The symbol a/b means a- b~!. Since 07! is meaningless, a/0 is also meaningless—division by O is always undefined.
    
    Property P7 has two important consequences. If a-b = a-c, it does not necessarily follow that b = c; for if a = 0, then both a-b and a.-c are 0, no matter what b and c are. However, if a ≠ 0, then b = c; this can be deduced from P7 as follows:
    
    If a-b=a-c and a ≠ 0,
    then a~!.(a-b)=a™!-(a-c):
    hence (a~!-a)-b= (aq! -a)-Cc;
    hence 1-b=1-c;
    
    hence b=c.
    
    It is also a consequence of P7 that if a-b = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0. In fact,
    
    if a-b=O and a ≠ 0,
    then a !-(a-b)=0:
    hence (a7!-a)-b=0:
    hence 1-b=0;
    hence b= 0.
    
    (It may happen that a = 0 and b = O are both true; this possibility is not excluded when we say "either a = 0 or b = 0"; in mathematics "or" is always used in the sense of "one or the other, or both.")
    
    ‘This latter consequence of P7 is constantly used in the solution of equations.
    Suppose, for example, that a number x is known to satisfy
    
    (x — 11)\(x — 2) = 0.
    
    Then it follows that either x — 1 = 0 or x — 2 = 0; hence x = 1 or x = 2.
  - |-
    On the basis of the eight properties listed so far it is still possible to prove very  
    little. Listing the next property, which combines the operations of addition and  
    multiplication, will alter this situation drastically.  
    
    (P9) If a,b, and c are any numbers, then  
    a − (b + c) = a − b + a − c.  
    (Notice that the equation (b + c) − a = b − a + c − a is also true, by P8.)  
    
    As an example of the usefulness of P9 we will now determine just when a − b =  
    b − a:  
    If a − b = b − a,  
    then (a − b) + b = (b − a) + b = b + b − a;  
    hence a = b + b − a,  
    hence a + a = (b + b − a) + a = b + b.  
    Consequently a − (1 + 1) = 5b − (1 + 1),  
    and therefore a = b.  
    
    A second use of P9 is the justification of the assertion a − 0 = 0 which we have  
    already made, and even used in a proof on page 6 (can you find where?). This  
    fact was not listed as one of the basic properties, even though no proof was offered  
    when it was first mentioned. With P1—P8 alone a proof was not possible, since the  
    number 0 appears only in P2 and P3, which concern addition, while the assertion  
    in question involves multiplication. With P9 the proof is simple, though perhaps  
    not obvious: We have  
    
    a − 0 + a − 0 = a − (0 + 0)  
    = a − 0;  
    
    as we have already noted, this immediately implies (by adding −(a − 0) to both  
    sides) that a − 0 = 0.  
    
    A series of further consequences of P9 may help explain the somewhat mysterious  
    rule that the product of two negative numbers is positive. ‘To begin with, we wil  
    establish the more easily acceptable assertion that (−a) − b = −(a − b). To  
    prove this, note that  
    
    (−a) − b + a − b = (−a + a) − b  
    = 0 − b  
    = −b.  
    
    It follows immediately (by adding −(a − b) to both sides) that (−a) − b = −(a − b).  
    Now note that
  - |-
    (a) - (b) + |[−(a − 5)] = (−a) − (−b) + (−a) − b  
    = (−a) - |(−b) + 5]  
    = (−a) - 0  
    = 0.  
    
    8 Prologue  
    
    Consequently, adding (a − b) to both sides, we obtain  
    (−a) − (−b) = a − b.  
    
    The fact that the product of two negative numbers is positive is thus a consequence  
    of P1—P9. In other words, if we want P1 to P9 to be true, the rule for the product of two  
    negative numbers is forced upon us.  
    
    The various consequences of P9 examined so far, although interesting and im-  
    portant, do not really indicate the significance of P9; after all, we could have listed  
    each of these properties separately. Actually, P9 is the justification for almost all  
    algebraic manipulations. For example, although we have shown how to solve the  
    equation  
    
    (x − I) − (−2) = 0,  
    
    we can hardly expect to be presented with an equation in this form. We are more  
    likely to be confronted with the equation  
    
    x² − 3x + 2 = 0.  
    The "factorization" x² − 3x + 2 = (x − 1)(x − 2) is really a triple use of P9:  
    
    (x − 1) − (−2) = x − (x − 2) + (−1) − (x − 2)  
    = x − x + x − (−2) + (−1) − x + (−1) − (−2)  
    = x² + x[(−2) + (−1)] + 2  
    = x² − 3x + 2.  
    
    A final illustration of the importance of P9 is the fact that this property is actually  
    used every time one multiplies arabic numerals. For example, the calculation  
    
    13  
    x24  
    52  
    26  
    312  
    
    is a concise arrangement for the following equations:  
    
    13 × 24 = 13 − (2 − 10 + 4)  
    = 13 − 2 − 10 + 13 − 4  
    = 26 − 10 + 52.  
    
    (Note that moving 26 to the left in the above calculation is the same as writing  
    26 − 10.) The multiplication 13 × 4 = 52 uses P9 also:
  - |-
    13-4=(1-10+3)-4  
    =1-10-44+3.4  
    = 4.104 12  
    =4-104+1-10+2  
    =(44+ 1)-10+2  
    =5-10+4+2  
    = 52.

    The properties P1—P9 have descriptive names which are not essential to remem-  
    ber, but which are often convenient for reference. We will take this opportunity to  
    list properties P1—P9 together and indicate the names by which they are commonly  
    designated.

    The three basic properties of numbers which remain to be listed are concerned with inequalities. Although inequalities occur rarely in elementary mathematics, they play a prominent role in calculus. The two notions of inequality, a < b (a is less than b) and a > b (a is greater than b), are intimately related: a < b means the same as b > a (thus a < 3 and 3 > a are merely two ways of writing the same assertion). The numbers a satisfying a > 0 are called positive, while those numbers a satisfying a < 0 are called negative. While positivity can thus be defined in terms of <, it is possible to reverse the procedure: a < b can be defined to mean that b - a is positive. In fact, it is convenient to consider the collection of all positive numbers, denoted by P, as the basic concept, and state all properties in terms of P:
    
    (P10) (Irishotomy law) For every number a, one and only one of the following holds:
    
    i) a = 0,
    
    (1) a is in the collection P,
    (1) —a is in the collection P.
    
    (P11) (Closure under addition) If a and b are in P, then a + b is in P.
    
    (P12) (Closure under multiplication) If a and b are in P, then a · b is in P.
    
    These three properties should be complemented with the following definitions:
    
    a > b if a - b is in P:
    a < b if b > a;
    
    a ≥ b if a > b or a = b;
    a ≤ b if a < b or a = b.
    
    Note, in particular, that a > 0 if and only if a is in P.
    
    All the familiar facts about inequalities, however elementary they may seem, are consequences of P10-P12. For example, if a and b are any two numbers, then precisely one of the following holds:
    
    a) a - b = 0,
    (1) a - b is in the collection P,
    (3) -(a - b) = b - a is in the collection P.
    
    Using the definitions just made, it follows that precisely one of the following holds:
    
    (i) a = b,
    (ii) a > b,
    (iii) b > a.

    A slightly more interesting fact results from the following manipulations. If
    a < b, so that b — a is in P, then surely (b + c) — (a + c) is in P; thus, if a < b,
    then a + c < b + c. Similarly, suppose a < b and b < c. Then
    
    b — a is in P,
    and c — b is in P,
    so c — a = (c — b) + (b — a) is in P.
    
    This shows that if a < b and b < c, then a < c. (The two inequalities a < b and
    b < c are usually written in the abbreviated form a < b < c, which has the third
    inequality a < c almost built in.)
    
    The following assertion is somewhat less obvious: If a < 0 and b < 0, then
    ab > 0. The only difficulty presented by the proof is the unraveling of definitions.
    The symbol a < 0 means, by definition, 0 > a, which means 0 — a = —a is in P.
    Similarly —b is in P, and consequently, by P12, (—a)(—b) = ab is in P. Thus
    ab > 0.
    
    The fact that ab > 0 if a > 0, b > 0 and also if a < 0, b < 0 has one
    special consequence: a² > 0 if a ≠ 0. Thus squares of nonzero numbers are
    always positive, and in particular we have proved a result which might have seemed
    
    sufficiently elementary to be included in our list of properties: 1 > 0 (since 1 = 1²).
    
    There is one slightly perplexing feature of the symbols > and <. The statements
    
    1 + 1 < 3
    1 + 1 < 2
    
    are both true, even though we know that < could be replaced by < in the first, and by = in the
    second. This sort of thing is bound to occur when < is used with specific numbers; the usefulness
    of the symbol is revealed by a statement like Theorem I- here equality holds for some values of a
    and b, while inequality holds for other values.
    
    THEOREM 1
    
    PROOF
    
    I. Basic Properties of Numbers 11
  - |-
    The fact that -—a > 0 if a < OQ 1s the basis of a concept which will play an  
    extremely important role in this book. For any number a, we define the absolute  
    value |a| of a as follows:
    
    a, a>0O  
    al={  
    
    —a, a<QO.  
    
    Note that |a| is always positive, except when a = 0. For example, we have | — 3| =  
    3,17, =7, 1+ V2— V3) = 14 V2— V3, and |1 + V2 — V10| = V10— V2 1.  
    
    In general, the most straightforward approach to any problem involving absolute  
    values requires treating several cases separately, since absolute values are defined  
    by cases to begin with. This approach may be used to prove the following very  
    important fact about absolute values.  
    
    For all numbers a and b, we have  
    
    la + b| < |a| + |B].  
    
    We will consider 4 cases:  
    
    (1) a>0, b>=0;  
    (2) a>0, b<0O;  
    (3) a<0O, b>0O:  
    (4) a<Q0, b<0.  
    
    In case (1) we also have a + b > O, and the theorem is obvious; in fact,  
    la+b|=a+b= |a|+ |b],  
    
    so that in this case equality holds.  
    In case (4) we have a + b < O, and again equality holds:  
    
    la+ b| = —(a+b) = —a+ (—b) = |a| + |b].  
    In case (2), when a > O and b < O, we must prove that  
    la+b|<a-—Db.  
    
    This case may therefore be divided into two subcases. If a+b > 0, then we must  
    prove that  
    
    atb<a-—pb,  
    1.€., b < —b,  
    
    which 1s certainly true since b < 0 and hence —b > 0. On the other hand, if  
    a+b <0, we must prove that  
    
    —a—b<a-—b,  
    1.€., —a <a,

    which 1s certainly true since a > O and hence —a < 0.
    Finally, note that case (3) may be disposed of with no additional work, by apply-
    ing case (2) with a and b interchanged. J
    12 Prologue
    
    Although this method of treating absolute values (separate consideration of var-
    ious Cases) 1s sometimes the only approach available, there are often simpler meth-
    ods which may be used. In fact, it is possible to give a much shorter proof of
    Theorem 1; this proof is motivated by the observation that
    
    |a| = √a².
    
    (Here, and throughout the book, |x| denotes the positive square root of x; this
    symbol is defined only when x > 0.) We may now observe that
    
    (|a + b|)² = (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²
    < a² + 2|a||b| + b²
    = |a|² + 2|a||b| + |b|²
    = (|a| + |b|)².
    
    From this we can conclude that |a + b| < |a| + |b| because x² < y² implies x < y,
    provided that x and y are both nonnegative; a proof of this fact is left to the reader
    (Problem 5).
    
    One final observation may be made about the theorem we have just proved: a
    close examination of either proof offered shows that
    
    |a + b| = |a| + |b|
    
    if a and b have the same sign (i.e., are both positive or both negative), or if one of
    the two is 0, while
    |a + b| < |a| + |b|
    
    if a and b are of opposite signs.
    
    We will conclude this chapter with a subtle point, neglected until now, whose
    inclusion is required in a conscientious survey of the properties of numbers. After
    stating property P9, we proved that a − b = b − a implies a = b. The proof began
    by establishing that
    
    a − (1 + 1) = b − (1 + 1),
  - |-
    From which we concluded that a = b. This result is obtained from the equation
    a-(1+1) = b-(1 +1) by dividing both sides by 1+ 1. Division by 0 should
    be avoided scrupulously, and it must therefore be admitted that the validity of the
    argument depends on knowing that 1+ 1 ≠ 0. Problem 25 is designed to convince
    you that this fact cannot possibly be proved from properties P1—P9 alone! Once
    P10, P11, and P12 are available, however, the proof is very simple: We have
    already seen that 1 > 0; it follows that 1 + 1 > 0, and in particular 1+ 1 ≠ 0.
    This last demonstration has perhaps only strengthened your feeling that it is
    absurd to bother proving such obvious facts, but an honest assessment of our
    present situation will help justify serious consideration of such details. In this
    chapter we have assumed that numbers are familiar objects, and that P1—P12 are
    merely explicit statements of obvious, well-known properties of numbers. It would
    be difficult, however, to justify this assumption. Although one learns how to "work
    with" numbers in school, just what numbers are, remains rather vague. A great
    deal of this book is devoted to elucidating the concept of numbers, and by the end
    of the book we will have become quite well acquainted with them. But it will be
    necessary to work with numbers throughout the book. It is therefore reasonable
    to admit frankly that we do not yet thoroughly understand numbers; we may still
    say that, in whatever way numbers are finally defined, they should certainly have
    properties P1—P12.

    Most of this chapter has been an attempt to present convincing evidence that
    P1—P12 are indeed basic properties which we should assume in order to deduce
    other familiar properties of numbers. Some of the problems (which indicate the
    derivation of other facts about numbers from P1—P12) are offered as further evi-
    dence. It is still a crucial question whether P1—P12 actually account for all prop-
    erties of numbers. As a matter of fact, we shall soon see that they do not. In the
    next chapter the deficiencies of properties P1—P12 will become quite clear, but
    the proper means for correcting these deficiencies is not so easily discovered. The
    crucial additional basic property of numbers which we are seeking is profound and
    subtle, quite unlike P1—P12. The discovery of this crucial property will require all
    the work of Part II of this book. In the remainder of Part I we will begin to see
    why some additional property is required; in order to investigate this we will have
    to consider a little more carefully what we mean by "numbers."

    (x₁y₁ + x₂y₂)² = (x₁y₁)² + (x₂y₂)² + 2x₁x₂y₁y₂

    **NUMBERS OF VARIOUS SORTS**
    
    In Chapter | we used the word "number" very loosely, despite our concern with
    the basic properties of numbers. It will now be necessary to distinguish carefully
    various kinds of numbers.
    
    The simplest numbers are the "counting numbers"
    
    $$
    \mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}
    $$
    
    The fundamental significance of this collection of numbers is emphasized by its
    symbol $ \mathbb{N} $ (for natural numbers). A brief glance at P1—P12 will show that our
    basic properties of "numbers" do not apply to $ \mathbb{N} $—for example, P2 and P3 do not
    make sense for $ \mathbb{N} $. From this point of view the system $ \mathbb{N} $ has many deficiencies.
    Nevertheless, $ \mathbb{N} $ is sufficiently important to deserve several comments before we
    consider larger collections of numbers.
    
    The most basic property of $ \mathbb{N} $ is the principle of "mathematical induction."
    Suppose $ P(x) $ means that the property $ P $ holds for the number $ x $. Then the prin-
    ciple of mathematical induction states that $ P(x) $ is true for all natural numbers $ x $
    
    provided that
    
    (1) $ P(1) $ is true.  
    (2) Whenever $ P(k) $ is true, $ P(k + 1) $ is true.
  - |-
    Note that condition (2) merely asserts the truth of P(k+1) under the assumption
    that P(k) is true; this suffices to ensure the truth of P(x) for all x, if condition
    (1) also holds. In fact, if P(1) is true, then it follows that P(2) is true (by using
    (2) in the special case k = 1). Now, since P(2) is true it follows that P(3) is true
    (using (2) in the special case k = 2). It is clear that each number will eventually be
    reached by a series of steps of this sort, so that P(k) is true for all numbers k.
    
    A favorite illustration of the reasoning behind mathematical induction envisions
    an infinite line of people,
    
    person number 1, person number 2, person number 3, ... .
    
    If each person has been instructed to tell any secret he hears to the person behind
    him (the one with the next largest number) and a secret is told to person number 1,
    then clearly every person will eventually learn the secret. If P(x) is the assertion
    that person number x will learn the secret, then the instructions given (to tell all
    secrets learned to the next person) assures that condition (2) is true, and telling
    the secret to person number 1 makes (1) true. The following example is a less
    facetious use of mathematical induction. There is a useful and striking formula
    which expresses the sum of the first n numbers in a simple way:
    
    n(n + 1)
    I+... =
    2
    
    To prove this formula, note first that it is clearly true for n = 1. Now assume that
    for some natural number k we have
    
    k(k + 1)
    1+2+...+k =
    2
    
    Then
    
    1+2+...+k + (k + 1) = k(k + 1)/2 + (k + 1)
    
    = [k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1)] / 2
    
    = (k^2 + k + 2k + 2) / 2
    
    = (k^2 + 3k + 2) / 2
    
    = (k + 1)(k + 2) / 2
    
    Thus, the formula holds for n = k + 1. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the
    formula is true for all natural numbers n.

    so the formula is also true for k + 1. By the principle of induction this proves
    the formula for all natural numbers n. This particular example illustrates a phe-
    nomenon that frequently occurs, especially in connection with formulas like the
    one just proved. Although the proof by induction 1s often quite straightforward,
    the method by which the formula was discovered remains a mystery. Problems 5
    and 6 indicate how some formulas of this type may be derived.
    
    The principle of mathematical induction may be formulated in an equivalent
    way without speaking of "properties" of a number, a term which 1s sufficiently
    vague to be eschewed in a mathematical discussion. A more precise formulation
    states that if A is any collection (or "set"—a synonymous mathematical term) of
    natural numbers and
    
    (1) 1 is in A,
    (2) k+1 is in A whenever k is in A,
    
    then A is the set of all natural numbers. It should be clear that this formulation
    adequately replaces the less formal one given previously—we just consider the
    set A of natural numbers x which satisfy P(x). For example, suppose A is the set
    of natural numbers n for which it is true that
    
    n(n + 1)
    5 ;
    
    l+---+tn=
    
    Our previous proof of this formula showed that A contains 1, and that k + 1 is
    in A, if k is. It follows that A is the set of all natural numbers, i.e., that the formula
    holds for all natural numbers n.
    
    There is yet another rigorous formulation of the principle of mathematical in-
    duction, which looks quite different. If A is any collection of natural numbers, it
    "2. Numbers of Various Sorts 23
  - |-
    It is tempting to say that A must have a smallest member. Actually, this statement  
    can fail to be true in a rather subtle way. A particularly important set of natural  
    numbers is the collection A that contains no natural numbers at all, the "empty  
    collection" or "null set,"'* denoted by @. The null set @ is a collection of natural  
    numbers that has no smallest member—in fact, it has no members at all. This  
    is the only possible exception, however; if A is a nonnull set of natural numbers,  
    then A has a least member. This "intuitively obvious" statement, known as the  
    "well-ordering principle," can be proved from the principle of induction as follows.  
    Suppose that the set A has no least member. Let B be the set of natural numbers  
    n such that 1,..., are all not in A. Clearly | 1s in B (because if 1 were in A, then  
    A would have | as smallest member). Moreover, if 1,...,k are not in A, surely  
    k + 1 is not in A (otherwise k + 1 would be the smallest member of A), so l,... ,  
    k +1 are all not in A. This shows that if k is in B, then k + 1 1s in B. It follows  
    that every number n is in B, 1.e., the numbers 1, ... , m are not in A for any natural  
    number n. Thus A = 9, which completes the proof.
    
    It is also possible to prove the principle of induction from the well-ordering  
    principle (Problem 10). Either principle may be considered as a basic assumption  
    about the natural numbers.
    
    There is still another form of induction which should be mentioned. It some-  
    times happens that in order to prove P(k + 1) we must assume not only P(k), but  
    also P(/) for all natural numbers / < k. In this case we rely on the "principle of  
    complete induction": If A is a set of natural numbers and
    
    (1) 1 is in A,  
    (2) k + 1 is in A if 1,...,k are in A,  
    
    then A is the set of all natural numbers.
  - |-
    Although the principle of complete induction may appear much stronger than  
    the ordinary principle of induction, it is actually a consequence of that principle.  
    The proof of this fact is left to the reader, with a hint (Problem 11). Applications  
    will be found in Problems 7, 17, 20 and 22.  
    
    Closely related to proofs by induction are "recursive definitions." For example,  
    the number n! (read "n factorial") is defined as the product of all the natural  
    numbers less than or equal to n:  
    
    n! = 1 · 2 · ... · (n − 1) · n.  
    This can be expressed more precisely as follows:  
    (1) 0! = 1  
    (2) n! = n · (n − 1)!  
    
    This form of the definition exhibits the relationship between n! and (n − 1)! in an  
    explicit way that is ideally suited for proofs by induction. Problem 23 reviews a  
    definition already familiar to you, which may be expressed more succinctly as a re-  
    cursive definition; as this problem shows, the recursive definition is really necessary  
    for a rigorous proof of some of the basic properties of the definition.  
    
    One definition which may not be familiar involves some convenient notation  
    which we will constantly be using. Instead of writing  
    
    we will usually employ the Greek letter Σ (capital sigma, for "sum") and write  
    
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{n}
    $$  
    In other words, $\sum_{i=1}^{n}$ denotes the sum of the numbers obtained by letting  
    $$
    i = 1, 2, \ldots, n.
    $$  
    Thus  
    
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
    $$  
    Notice that the letter $i$ really has nothing to do with the number denoted by $3 i$,  
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{n}
    $$  
    and can be replaced by any convenient symbol (except $n$, of course!):  
    
    $$
    \sum_{j=1}^{n} j = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
    $$  
    $$
    \sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
    $$  
    $$
    \sum_{y=1}^{n} y = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
    $$  
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
    $$  
    
    * Although it may not strike you as a collection, in the ordinary sense of the word, the null set arises  
    quite naturally in many contexts. We frequently consider the set $A$, consisting of all $x$ satisfying some  
    property $P$; often we have no guarantee that $P$ is satisfied by any number, so that $A$ might be $\emptyset$—in  
    fact often one proves that $P$ is always false by showing that $A = \emptyset$.
  - |-
    To define $ a_n $ precisely really requires a recursive definition:
    
    $$
    (1) \quad S_0 = a_0,
    $$
    
    $$
    (2) \quad S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n.
    $$
    
    But only purveyors of mathematical austerity would insist too strongly on such precision. In practice, all sorts of modifications of this symbolism are used, and no one ever considers it necessary to add any words of explanation. 'The symbol
    
    $$
    a_i,
    $$
    for example, is an obvious way of writing
    
    $$
    a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + \cdots + a_n,
    $$
    
    or more precisely,
    
    $$
    \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i.
    $$
    
    The deficiencies of the natural numbers which we discovered at the beginning of this chapter may be partially remedied by extending this system to the set of integers
    
    $$
    \ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots
    $$
    
    This set is denoted by $ \mathbb{Z} $ (from German "Zahl," number). Of properties P1-P12, only P7 fails for $ \mathbb{Z} $.
  - |-
    A still larger system of numbers 1s obtained by taking quotients m/n of integers (with n ≠ 0). These numbers are called rational numbers, and the set of all rational numbers is denoted by Q (for "quotients"). In this system of numbers all of P1–P12 are true. It is tempting to conclude that the "properties of numbers," which we studied in some detail in Chapter 1, refer to just one set of numbers, namely, Q. There is, however, a still larger collection of numbers to which properties P1–P12 apply—the set of all real numbers, denoted by R. The real numbers include not only the rational numbers, but other numbers as well (the irrational numbers) which can be represented by infinite decimals; a and √2 are both examples of irrational numbers. The proof that √2 is irrational is not easy—we shall devote all of Chapter 16 of Part III to a proof of this fact. The irrationality of √2, on the other hand, is quite simple, and was known to the Greeks. (Since the Pythagorean theorem shows that an isosceles right triangle, with sides of length 1, has a hypotenuse of length √2, it is not surprising that the Greeks should have investigated this question.) The proof depends on a few observations about the natural numbers. Every natural number n can be written either in the form 2k for some integer k, or else in the form 2k + 1 for some integer k (this "obvious" fact has a simple proof by induction (Problem 8)). Those natural numbers of the form 2k are called even; those of the form 2k + 1 are called odd. Note that even numbers have even squares, and odd numbers have odd squares:
    
    (2k)² = 4k² = 2·(2k²),
    (2k + 1)² = 4k² + 4k + 1 = 2·(2k² + 2k) + 1.
  - |-
    In particular it follows that the converse must also hold: if n* is even, then n is even;
    if n* is odd, then n is odd. The proof that J2 is irrational is now quite simple.
    Suppose that V2 were rational; that is, suppose there were natural numbers p
    and q such that
    
    We can assume that p and q have no common divisor (since all common divisors
    could be divided out to begin with). Now we have
    
    This shows that p is even, and consequently p must be even; that is, p = 2k for
    some natural number k. Then
    
    p^2 = 2q^2,
    
    SO
    (2k)^2 = 2q^2,
    
    This shows that q^2 is even, and consequently that q is even. Thus both p and q
    are even, contradicting the fact that p and q have no common divisor. This
    contradiction completes the proof.
    
    It is important to understand precisely what this proof shows. We have demon-
    strated that there is no rational number x such that x^2 = 2. This assertion is often
    expressed more briefly by saying that √2 is irrational. Note, however, that the
    
    use of the symbol √2 implies the existence of some number (necessarily irrational)
    whose square is 2. We have not proved that such a number exists and we can as-
    sert confidently that, at present, a proof is impossible for us. Any proof at this stage
    would have to be based on P1–P12 (the only properties of R we have mentioned);
    since P1–P12 are also true for Q, the exact same argument would show that there
    is a rational number whose square is 2, and this we know is false. (Note that the
    reverse argument will not work—our proof that there is no rational number whose
    square is 2 cannot be used to show that there is no real number whose square is 2,
    because our proof used not only P1–P12 but also a special property of Q, the fact
    that every number in Q can be written p/q for integers p and q.)
  - |-
    This particular deficiency in our list of properties of the real numbers could,
    of course, be corrected by adding a new property which asserts the existence of
    square roots of positive numbers. Resorting to such a measure is, however, neither
    aesthetically pleasing nor mathematically satisfactory; we would still not know that
    every number has an nth root if n is odd, and that every positive number has an
    nth root if n is even. Even if we assumed this, we could not prove the existence of
    a number x satisfying x² + x + 1 = 0 (even though there does happen to be one),
    since we do not know how to write the solution of the equation in terms of nth
    roots (in fact, it is known that the solution cannot be written in this form). And,
    of course, we certainly do not wish to assume that all equations have solutions,
    since this is false (no real number x satisfies x7 + 1 = 0, for example). In fact,
    this direction of investigation is not a fruitful one. ‘The most useful hints about the
    property distinguishing R from Q, the most compelling evidence for the necessity
    of elucidating this property, do not come from the study of numbers alone. In
    order to study the properties of the real numbers in a more profound way, we
    must study more than the real numbers. At this point we must begin with the
    foundations of calculus, in particular the fundamental concept on which calculus
    is based—functions.

    It seems likely that $ \sqrt{n} $ is irrational whenever the natural number $ n $ is not the square of another natural number. Although the method of Problem 13 may actually be used to treat any particular case, it is not clear in advance that it will always work, and a proof for the general case requires some extra information.
    
    A natural number $ p $ is called a prime number if it is impossible to write $ p = ab $ for natural numbers $ a $ and $ b $ unless one of these is $ p $, and the other is 1; for convenience we also agree that 1 is not a prime number. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19. If $ n > 1 $ is not a prime, then $ n = ab $, with $ a $ and $ b $ both < $ n $; if either $ a $ or $ b $ is not a prime it can be factored similarly; continuing in this way proves that we can write $ n $ as a product of primes. For example, 28 = 4 × 7 = 2 × 2 × 7.

    A fundamental theorem about integers, which we will not prove here, states that this factorization is unique, except for the order of the factors. Thus, for example, 28 can never be written as a product of primes one of which is 3, nor can it be written in a way that involves 2 only once (now you should appreciate why | is not allowed as a prime).

    Suppose we know properties Pl and P4 for the natural numbers, but that
    multiplication has never been mentioned. Then the following can be used
    as a recursive definition of multiplication:
    
    1-b = b,
    (a+1)-b = a-b + b.
    
    Prove the following (in the order suggested!):

    In this chapter we began with the natural numbers and gradually built up to
    the real numbers. A completely rigorous discussion of this process requires
    a little book in itself (see Part V). No one has ever figured out how to get to
    the real numbers without going through this process, but if we do accept the
    real numbers as given, then the natural numbers can be defined as the real
    numbers of the form 1, 1 +1, 1+1+1, etc. 'The whole point of this problem

    University B. once boasted 17 tenured professors of mathematics. "Radiation prescribed that at their weekly luncheon meeting, faithfully attended by
    all 17, any members who had discovered an error in their published work
    should make an announcement of this fact, and promptly resign. Such an an-
    nouncement had never actually been made, because no professor was aware
    of any errors in her or his work. This is not to say that no errors existed,
    however. In fact, over the years, in the work of every member of the de-
    partment at least one error had been found, by some other member of the
    department. This error had been mentioned to all other members of the
    department, but the actual author of the error had been kept ignorant of the
    fact, to forestall any resignations.
  - |-
    One fateful year, the department was augmented by a visitor from another university, one Prof. X, who had come with hopes of being offered a permanent position at the end of the academic year. Naturally, he was apprised, by various members of the department, of the published errors which had been discovered. When the hoped-for appointment failed to materialize, Prof. X obtained his revenge at the last luncheon of the year. "I have enjoyed my visit here very much," he said, "but I feel that there is one thing that I have to tell you. At least one of you has published an incorrect result, which has been discovered by others in the department." What happened the next year?
    
    After figuring out, or looking up, the answer to Problem 27, consider the following: Each member of the department already knew what Prof. X asserted, so how could his saying it change anything?
    
    FOUNDATIONS
    
    The statement is so frequently made that the differential calculus deals with continuous magnitude, and yet
    
    an explanation of this continuity is nowhere given;
    
    even the most rigorous expositions
    
    of the differential calculus do not base their proofs upon continuity but,
    
    with more or less consciousness of the fact,
    
    they either appeal to geometric notions
    
    or those suggested by geometry,
    
    or depend upon theorems which are never
    
    established in a purely arithmetic manner.
    Among these, for example,
    
    belongs the above-mentioned theorem,
    
    and a more careful investigation
    
    convinced me that this theorem, or
    
    any one equivalent to it, can be regarded
    
    in some way as a Sufficient basis
    
    for infinitesimal analysis.
    
    It then only remained to discover its true
    
    origin in the elements of arithmetic
    
    and thus at the same time
    
    to secure a real definition of
    
    the essence of continuity.

    CHAPTER
    
    PROVISIONAL DEFINITION
    
    FUNCTIONS
  - |-
    Undoubtedly the most important concept in all of mathematics is that of a
    function—in almost every branch of modern mathematics functions turn out to
    be the central objects of investigation. It will therefore probably not surprise you
    to learn that the concept of a function is one of great generality. Perhaps it will
    be a relief to learn that, for the present, we will be able to restrict our attention to
    functions of a very special kind; even this small class of functions will exhibit sufficient variety to engage our attention for quite some time. We will not even begin
    with a proper definition. For the moment a provisional definition will enable us to
    discuss functions at length, and will illustrate the intuitive notion of functions, as
    understood by mathematicians. Later, we will consider and discuss the advantages
    of the modern mathematical definition. Let us therefore begin with the following:
    
    A function is a rule which assigns, to each of certain real numbers, some other real
    number.
    
    The following examples of functions are meant to illustrate and amplify this defi-
    nition, which, admittedly, requires some such clarification.
    
    Example 1: The rule which assigns to each number the square of that number.
    Example 2: The rule which assigns to each number y the number
    
    y^2 + 3y + 4 + 5
    yet] —
    
    Example 3: The rule which assigns to each number c ≠ 1, —1 the number
    
    Ce+3c+5
    ce—-1l
    
    Example 4: The rule which assigns to each number x satisfying —17 < x < 2/3
    
    the number x'.
    
    Example 5: The rule which assigns to each number a the number 0 if a is
    irrational, and the number | if a is rational.
    
    Example 6: The rule which assigns
    
    to 2 the number 5,
    36
    
    to 17 the number —,

    to = the number 28,
    
    to — the number 28,
    1
    
    and to any y ≠ 2, 17, */17, or 36/2, the number 16 if y is of the form a +bV/2
    for a, b in Q.
  - |-
    Example 7 The rule which assigns to each number t the number t? + x. (This  
    rule depends, of course, on what the number x 1s, so we are really describing  
    infinitely many different functions, one for each number x.)
    
    Example 86 ‘The rule which assigns to each number z the number of 7's in the  
    decimal expansion of z, if this number 1s finite, and —z if there are infinitely many  
    7's in the decimal expansion of z.
    
    One thing should be abundantly clear from these examples—a function 1s any  
    rule that assigns numbers to certain other numbers, not just a rule which can  
    be expressed by an algebraic formula, or even by one uniform condition which  
    applies to every number; nor is it necessarily a rule which you, or anybody else,  
    can actually apply in practice (no one knows, for example, what rule 8 associates  
    to x). Moreover, the rule may neglect some numbers and it may not even be clear  
    to which numbers the function applies (try to determine, for example, whether the  
    function in Example 6 applies to zr). ‘The set of numbers to which a function does  
    apply is called the domain of the function.
    
    Before saying anything else about functions we badly need some notation. Since  
    throughout this book we shall frequently be talking about functions (indeed we shall  
    hardly ever talk about anything else) we need a convenient way of naming func-  
    tions, and of referring to functions in general. The standard practice is to denote  
    a function by a letter. For obvious reasons the letter "f" is a favorite, thereby

    making "g" and "h" other obvious candidates, but any letter (or any reasonable
    symbol, for that matter) will do, not excluding "x" and "y", although these letters
    are usually reserved for indicating numbers. If f is a function, then the number
    which f associates to a number x is denoted by f(x)—this symbol is read "f of
    x" and is often called the value of f at x. Naturally, if we denote a function by x,
    some other letter must be chosen to denote the number (a perfectly legitimate,
    though perverse, choice would be "f," leading to the symbol x(f)). Note that the
    symbol f(x) makes sense only for x in the domain of f; for other x the symbol
    f (x) is not defined.
    
    If the functions defined in Examples 1-8 are denoted by f, g, h, r, 5, 0, ax,
    
    and y, then we can rewrite their definitions as follows:
    (1) f(x) =x? — for all x.

    These definitions illustrate the common procedure adopted for defining a function f—indicating what f(x) is for every number x in the domain of f. (Notice that this is exactly the same as indicating f(a) for every number a, or f(b) for every number b, etc.) In practice, certain abbreviations are tolerated. Definition (1) could be written simply
    
    (1) f(x) = x?
    
    the qualifying phrase "for all x" being understood. Of course, for definition (4) the only possible abbreviation is
    
    (4) r(x) = x', -17 <x <2/3.
    
    It is usually understood that a definition such as
    
    l l
    k(x) = -—- + —, x ∈ (0,1)
    
    can be shortened to
    
    |
    
    x - 1
    
    |
    k(x) = —+
    x
    
    in other words, unless the domain is explicitly restricted further, it is understood to consist of all numbers for which the definition makes any sense at all.
    
    You should have little difficulty checking the following assertions about the functions defined above:
    
    f(x) = f(x) + 2x + 4 + 1;
    g(x) = h(x) if x + 3x + 5 = 0;

    a(x) =x - [ f(x) + 1];
    
    If the expression f(s(a)) looks unreasonable to you, then you are forgetting that s(a) is a number like any other number, so that f(s(a)) makes sense. As a matter of fact, f(s(a)) = s(a) for all a. Why? Even more complicated expressions than f (s(a)) are, after a first exposure, no more difficult to unravel. The expression
    
    f(r(s(0(a3(yG)))))),
    
    formidable as it appears, may be evaluated quite easily with a little patience:
    
    f(r(s(0(a3(y())))))
    = f(r(s(6(a3(0)))))
    = f(r(s(8(3))))
    = f(r(s(16)))
    = f(r())
    = f(l)
    = |.
  - |-
    The first few problems at the end of this chapter give further practice manipulating  
    this symbolism.
    
    The function defined in (1) is a rather special example of an extremely impor-  
    tant class of functions, the polynomial functions. A function f is a polynomial  
    function if there are real numbers a₀, ..., aₙ, such that
    
    f(x) = aₙxⁿ + aₙ₋₁xⁿ⁻¹ + ... + a₂x² + a₁x + a₀, for all x
    
    (when f(x) is written in this form it is usually tacitly assumed that aₙ ≠ 0). The  
    highest power of x with a nonzero coefficient is called the degree of f; for  
    example, the polynomial function f defined by f(x) = 5x⁶ + 137x⁴ − m has  
    degree 6.
    
    The functions defined in (2) and (3) belong to a somewhat larger class of func-  
    tions, the rational functions; these are the functions of the form p/q where p  
    and q are polynomial functions (and q is not the function which is always 0). The  
    rational functions are themselves quite special examples of an even larger class of  
    functions, very thoroughly studied in calculus, which are simpler than many of the  
    functions first mentioned in this chapter. The following are examples of this kind  
    of function:
    
    (9) f(x)=
    
    x + x⁷ + 4x sin² x  
    x sin x + x sin² x
    
    (10) f(x) = sin(x²).  
    (11) f(x)= sin(sin(x)).  
    (12) f(x)= sin² (sin(sin² (x sin³ x))) − sin(½ sin ( ̃ sin ( ̃ ))),  
    
    x + sin x
  - |-
    By what criterion, you may feel impelled to ask, can such functions, especially a
    monstrosity like (12), be considered simple? ‘The answer is that they can be built
    up from a few simple functions using a few simple means of combining functions.
    In order to construct the functions (9)-(12) we need to start with the "identity
    function" J, for which (x) = x, and the "sine function" sin, whose value sin(x) at
    x is often written simple sinx. The following are some of the important ways in
    which functions may be combined to produce new functions.
    
    If f and g are any two functions, we can define a new function f + g, called
    the sum of f and g, by the equation
    
    (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x).
    
    Note that according to the conventions we have adopted, the domain of f + g
    consists of all x for which " f(x) + g(x)" makes sense, 1.e., the set of all x in both
    domain f and domain g. If A and B are any two sets, then A ∩ B (read "A
    intersect B" or "the intersection of A and B") denotes the set of x in both A
    and B; this notation allows us to write domain( f + g) = domain f ∩ domain g.
    
    In a similar vein, we define the product f - g and the quotient f / g of
    f and g by
    (f - g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)
    
    (f / g)(x) = f(x)/g(x)
    
    Moreover, if g is a function and c is a number, we define a new function c · g by
    
    and
    
    (c · g)(x) = c · g(x).
    
    This becomes a special case of the notation f - g if we agree that the symbol c
    should also represent the function f defined by f(x) = c; such a function, which
    has the same value for all numbers x, is called a constant function.
  - |-
    The domain of $ f - g $ is $ \text{domain } f \cap \text{domain } g $, and the domain of $ c - g $ is simply the domain of $ g $. On the other hand, the domain of $ \frac{f}{g} $ is rather complicated—it may be written $ \text{domain } f \cap \text{domain } g \setminus \{x : g(x) = 0\} $, the symbol $ \{x : g(x) = 0\} $ denoting the set of numbers $ x $ such that $ g(x) = 0 $. In general, $ \{x : ...\} $ denotes the set of all $ x $ such that "..." is true. Thus $ \{x : x^2 + 3 < 11\} $ denotes the set of all numbers $ x $ such that $ x^2 < 8 $, and consequently $ \{x : x^3 < 11\} = \{x : x < 2\} $. Either of these symbols could just as well have been written using $ y $ everywhere instead of $ x $. Variations of this notation are common, but hardly require any discussion. Any one can guess that $ \{x > 0 : x^3 < 8\} $ denotes the set of positive numbers whose cube is less than 8; it could be expressed more formally as $ \{x : x > 0 \text{ and } x^3 < 8\} $. Incidentally, this set is equal to the set $ \{x : 0 < x < 2\} $.
    
    A variation is slightly less transparent, but very standard. The set $ \{1, 3, 2, 4\} $, for example, contains just the four numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4; it can also be denoted by $ \{x : x = 1 \text{ or } x = 3 \text{ or } x = 2 \text{ or } x = 4\} $.
    
    Certain facts about the sum, product, and quotient of functions are obvious consequences of facts about sums, products, and quotients of numbers. For example, it is very easy to prove that
    
    $$
    (f + g) \circ h = f \circ h + g \circ h.
    $$
    
    The proof is characteristic of almost every proof which demonstrates that two functions are equal—the two functions must be shown to have the same domain, and the same value at any number in the domain. For example, to prove that $ (f + g) + h = f + (g + h) $, note that unraveling the definition of the two sides gives
    
    $$
    [(f + g) + h](x) = (f + g)(x) + h(x)
    = [f(x) + g(x)] + h(x)
    $$
  - |-
    and
    
    [ft(g th)](x) = f(x) + (g thx)
    = f(x) + [g(x) +h(x)],
    
    and the equality of [f(x)+ g9(x)] +h(x) and f(x) + [g(x) +A(x)] 1s a fact about
    numbers. In this proof the equality of the two domains was not explicitly men-
    tioned because this is obvious, as soon as we begin to write down these equations;
    the domain of (f + g) +h and of f + (g +A) 1s clearly domain f 1 domain gM
    domainh. We naturally write f +g +h for (f +g) +h= f4+(g +h), precisely
    as we did for numbers.
    
    It is just as easy to prove that (f-g)-h = f -(g-h), and this function is denoted
    by f-g-h. The equations f+ ¢g=g+f and f-g =g- f should also present
    no difficulty.
    
    Using the operations +, -, / we can now express the function f defined in (9)
    by
    
    I+/-I+/]-sin-sin
    
    [-sm-+/-sin-sin
    
    It should be clear, however, that we cannot express function (10) this way. We re-
    quire yet another way of combining functions. ‘This combination, the composition
    of two functions, is by far the most important.
    
    If f and g are any two functions, we define a new function f og, the compo-
    sition of f and g, by
    
    (fo g)(x) = f(g(x));
    
    the domain of fog is {x : x is in domain g and g(x) 1s in domain f}. The symbol
    "fog" is often read "f circle g." Compared to the phrase "the composition of f
    and g" this has the advantage of brevity, of course, but there is another advantage
    of far greater import: there is much less chance of confusing fo g with go f, and

    These must not be confused, since they are not usually equal; in fact, almost any f and g chosen at random will illustrate this point (try f = /-J and g = sin, for example). Lest you become too apprehensive about the operation of composition, let us hasten to point out that composition is associative:
    
    (fog)oh = fo(goh)
    
    (and the proof is a triviality); this function is denoted by fo goh. We can now write the functions (10), (11), (12) as
    
    (10) f = sin o (/ - J),
    (11) f = sin o (sin o (/ - J)),
    (12) f = (sin - sin) o sin o (sin - sin) o (J - [(sin - sin) o (J - J)]) -
    
    . (ae)
    sin o : ,
    !+sm
    
    One fact has probably already become clear. Although this method of writing functions reveals their "structure" very clearly, it is hardly short or convenient. The shortest name for the function f such that f(x) = sin(x') for all x unfortunately seems to be "the function f such that f(x) = sin(x') for all x." The need for abbreviating this clumsy description has been clear for two hundred years, but no reasonable abbreviation has received universal acclaim. At present the strongest contender for this honor is something like
    
    x > sin(x')
    
    (read "x goes to sin(x)") or just "x arrow sin(x7)"), but it is hardly popular among writers of calculus textbooks. In this book we will tolerate a certain amount of ellipsis, and speak of "the function f(x) = sin(x')." Even more popular is the quite drastic abbreviation: "the function sin(x*)." For the sake of precision we will never use this description, which, strictly speaking, confuses a number and a function, but it is so convenient that you will probably end up adopting it for personal use. As with any convention, utility is the motivating factor, and this criterion is reasonable so long as the slight logical deficiencies cause no confusion.

    x —> x + t, ie, the function f such that f(x) = x + 2? for all x
    
    Or
    
    t —> x + t, ie., the function f such that f(t) = x + t? for all t.
    
    As we shall see, however, for many important concepts associated with functions,
    calculus has a notation which contains the "x —" built in.
    
    By now we have made a sufficiently extensive investigation of functions to war-
    rant reconsidering our definition. We have defined a function as a "rule," but it is
    hardly clear what this means. If we ask "What happens if you break this rule?" it
    is not easy to say whether this question is merely facetious or actually profound.
    
    46 foundations
    
    A more substantial objection to the use of the word "rule" is that
    
    f(x) = x^2?
    and
    
    f(x) = x^7 + 3x^4 + 3 - 3(x + 1)
    
    are certainly different rules, if by a rule we mean the actual instructions given for
    determining f(x); nevertheless, we want
    
    f(x) = x^2?
    and
    
    f(x) = x^7 + 3x^4 + 3 - 3(x + 1)
    
    to define the same function. For this reason, a function is sometimes defined as an
    "association" between numbers; unfortunately the word "association" escapes the
    objections raised against "rule" only because it is even more vague.
    
    There is, of course, a satisfactory way of defining functions, or we should never
    have gone to the trouble of criticizing our original definition. But a satisfactory
    definition can never be constructed by finding synonyms for English words which
    are troublesome. The definition which mathematicians have finally accepted for
    "function" is a beautiful example of the means by which intuitive ideas have been
    incorporated into rigorous mathematics. The correct question to ask about a
    function is not "What is a rule?" or "What is an association?" but "What does
    one have to know about a function in order to know all about it?" The answer to
    the last question is easy—for each number x one needs to know the number f(x);
    we can imagine a table which would display all the information one could desire
    about the function f(x) = x^2:
    
    x   f(x)
    -2  4

    It is not even necessary to arrange the numbers in a table (which would actually
    be impossible if we wanted to list all of them). Instead of a two column array we
    can consider various pairs of numbers
    
    (1.1). (-1,1), (2.4), (—2.4), (7, 27), (V2,2),...

    simply collected together into a set.* ‘Io find f(1) we simply take the second
    number of the pair whose first member is 1; to find f(z) we take the second
    number of the pair whose first member 1s 7. We seem to be saying that a function
    might as well be defined as a collection of pairs of numbers. For example, if we
    were given the following collection (which contains just 5 pairs):
    
    f ={(1,7), (3,7), (5,3), (4,8), (8, 4)},
    then f(1) = 7, f(3) =7, f(5) = 3, f(4) = 8, f(8) = 4 and 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 are the
    
    only numbers in the domain of f. If we consider the collection
    
    f ={(1,7), (3,7), (2,5), (4, 8), (8,4) },
    then f(3) = 7, f(2) =5, f(8) = 4; but it is impossible to decide whether f(1) = 7
    
    or f(1) = 8. In other words, a function cannot be defined to be any old collection
    of pairs of numbers; we must rule out the possibility which arose in this case. We
    are therefore led to the following definition.
    
    A function is a collection of pairs of numbers with the following property: if
    (a,b) and (a,c) are both in the collection, then b = c; in other words, the
    collection must not contain two different pairs with the same first element.
  - |-
    This is our first full-fledged definition, and illustrates the format we shall always use to define significant new concepts. These definitions are so important (at least as important as theorems) that it is essential to know when one is actually at hand, and to distinguish them from comments, motivating remarks, and casual explanations. They will be preceded by the word DEFINITION, contain the term being defined in boldface letters, and constitute a paragraph unto themselves.
    
    There is one more definition (actually defining two things at once) which can now be made rigorously:
    
    If f is a function, the domain of f is the set of all a for which there is some b such that (a, b) is in f. If a is in the domain of f, it follows from the definition of a function that there is, in fact, a unique number b such that (a, b) is in f. This unique b is denoted by f(a).
    
    With this definition we have reached our goal: the important thing about a function f is that a number f(x) is determined for each number x in its domain. You may feel that we have also reached the point where an intuitive definition has been replaced by an abstraction with which the mind can hardly grapple. Two consolations may be offered. First, although a function has been defined as a collection of pairs, there is nothing to stop you from thinking of a function as a rule. Second, neither the intuitive nor the formal definition indicates the best way of thinking about functions. The best way is to draw pictures; but this requires a chapter all by itself.

    Polynomial functions, because they are simple, yet flexible, occupy a favored  
    role in most investigations of functions. 'The following two problems illustrate their  
    flexibility, and guide you through a derivation of their most important elementary  
    properties.

    (a) If $ x_1, \ldots, x_n $ are distinct numbers, find a polynomial function $ f_j $ of  
    degree $ n - 1 $ which is 1 at $ x_i $ and 0 at $ x_j $ for $ j \neq i $. Hint: the product of  
    all $ (x - x_j) $ for $ j \neq i $, is 0 at $ x_i $ if $ j \neq i $. (This product is usually denoted  
    by

    \prod_{j=1, j \neq i}^n (x - x_j)

    for sums.)
    
    (b) Now find a polynomial function $ f $ of degree $ n - 1 $ such that $ f(x_i) = a_i $,  
    where $ a_1, \ldots, a_n $ are given numbers. (You should use the functions  
    $ f_j $ from part (a). The formula you will obtain is called the "Lagrange  
    interpolation formula.")
    
    (a) Prove that for any polynomial function $ f $, and any number $ a $, there is a  
    polynomial function $ g $, and a number $ b $, such that $ f(x) = (x - a)g(x) + b $ for all $ x $.  
    (The idea is simply to divide $ (x - a) $ into $ f(x) $ by long division, until a constant remainder is left. For example, the calculation  
    
    $$
    \frac{x^3 - 3x + 1}{x - 1} = x^2 - x - 2
    $$
    
    shows that $ x^3 - 3x + 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 - x - 2) + 1 $. A formal proof is  
    possible by induction on the degree of $ f $.)

    (d) Show that for each n there is a polynomial function of degree n with n roots. If n is even, find a polynomial function of degree n with no roots, and if n is odd, find one with only one root.

    Find expressions for $ C_{A \cup B} $ and $ C_{A \cap B} $, in terms of $ C_A $ and $ C_B $. (The symbol $ A \cup B $ was defined in this chapter, but the other two may be new to you. They can be defined as follows:
    
    $$
    A \cup B = \{x: x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}, \\
    A - B = \{x: x \in A \text{ but } x \notin B\}

    (b) Suppose f is a function such that f(x) = 0 or 1 for each x. Prove that there is a set A such that f = $ C_A $.
    
    (c) Show that f = f° if and only if f = $ C_A $ for some set A.

    A function f is even if f(x) = f(−x) and odd if f(x) = −f(−x). For

    THEOREM 1
    
    PROOF
    
    APPENDIX. ORDERED PAIRS
    
    Not only in the definition of a function, but in other parts of the book as well, it is necessary to use the notion of an ordered pair of objects. A definition has not yet been given, and we have never even stated explicitly what properties an ordered pair is supposed to have. The one property which we will require states formally that the ordered pair (a,b) should be determined by a and b, and the order in which they are given:
    
    if (a,b) = (c,d), then a = c and b = d.
    
    Ordered pairs may be treated most conveniently by simply introducing (a, b) as an undefined term and adopting the basic property as an axiom—since this property is the only significant fact about ordered pairs, there is not much point worrying about what an ordered pair "really" is. Those who find this treatment satisfactory need read no further.
  - |-
    The rest of this short appendix is for the benefit of those readers who will feel uncomfortable unless ordered pairs are somehow defined so that this basic property becomes a theorem. There is no point in restricting our attention to ordered pairs of numbers; it is just as reasonable, and just as important, to have available the notion of an ordered pair of any two mathematical objects. 'This means that our definition ought to involve only concepts common to all branches of mathematics. The one common concept which pervades all areas of mathematics is that of a set, and ordered pairs (like everything else in mathematics) can be defined in this context; an ordered pair will turn out to be a set of a rather special sort.
    
    The set {a, b}, containing the two elements a and b, is an obvious first choice, but will not do as a definition for (a, b), because there is no way of determining from {a,b} which of a or b is meant to be the first element. A more promising candidate is the rather startling set:
    
    { {a}, {a, b} }.
    
    This set has two members, both of which are themselves sets; one member is the set {a}, containing the single member a, the other is the set {a, b}. Shocking as it may seem, we are going to define (a, b) to be this set. The justification for this choice is given by the theorem immediately following the definition—the definition works, and there really isn't anything else worth saying.
    
    (a, b) = { {a}, {a, b} }.
    
    If (a,b) = (c,d), then a = c and b = d.
    
    The hypothesis means that
    {{a}, {a,b}} = {{c}, {c,d}}.
    
    Now { {a}, {a, b} } contains just two members, {a} and {a,b}; and a is the only common element of these two members of { {a}, {a,b} }. Similarly, c is the unique common member of both members of { {c}, {c,d} }. Therefore a = c. We therefore have
    
    {{a}, {a,b}} = {{c}, {c,d}}.

    and only the proof that b = d remains. It is convenient to distinguish 2 cases.
    
    Case 1. b = a. In this case, {a, b} = {a}, so the set { {a}, {a, b}} really has only one
    member, namely, {a}. The same must be true of { {a}, {a, d}}, so {a, d} = {a},
    which implies that d = a = b.
    
    Case 2. b ≤ a. In this case, b is in one member of { {a}, {a, b} } but not in the
    other. It must therefore be true that b is in one member of { {a}, {a, d}} but not
    in the other. This can happen only if b is in {a, d}, but b is not in {a}; thus b = a
    or b = d, but b ≠ a; hence b = d. ✅

    Mention the real numbers to a mathematician and the image of a straight line will
    probably form in her mind, quite involuntarily. And most likely she will neither
    banish nor too eagerly embrace this mental picture of the real numbers. "Geometric
    intuition" will allow her to interpret statements about numbers in terms of this
    picture, and may even suggest methods of proving them. Although the properties
    of the real numbers which were studied in Part I are not greatly illuminated by a
    geometric picture, such an interpretation will be a great aid in Part II.

    You are probably already familiar with the conventional method of considering
    the straight line as a picture of the real numbers, i.e., of associating to each real
    number a point on a line. 'To do this (Figure 1) we pick, arbitrarily, a point which
    we label 0, and a point to the right, which we label 1. The point twice as far to
    the right is labeled 2, the point the same distance from 0 to 1, but to the left of 0,
    is labeled -1, etc. With this arrangement, if a < b, then the point corresponding
    to a lies to the left of the point corresponding to b. We can also draw rational
    numbers, such as 7 in the obvious way. It is usually taken for granted that the
    irrational numbers also somehow fit into this scheme, so that every real number
    can be drawn as a point on the line. We will not make too much fuss about
    justifying this assumption, since this method of "drawing" numbers is intended
    solely as a method of picturing certain abstract ideas, and our proofs will never
    rely on these pictures (although we will frequently use a picture to suggest or help
    explain a proof). Because this geometric picture plays such a prominent, albeit
    inessential role, geometric terminology is frequently employed when speaking of
    numbers—thus a number is sometimes called a point, and R is often called the
    real line.
    
    The number |a—b| has a simple interpretation in terms of this geometric picture:
    it is the distance between a and b, the length of the line segment which has a as one
    end point and b as the other. This means, to choose an example whose frequent
    occurrence justifies special consideration, that the set of numbers x which satisfy
    |x — a| < ε may be pictured as the collection of points whose distance from a is
    less than ε. 'This set of points is the "interval" from a — ε to a+ε, which may also
    be described as the points corresponding to numbers x with a — ε < x < a+ε (Figure 2).

    Sets of numbers which correspond to intervals arise so frequently that it is desirable to have special names for them. The set {x : a < x < b} is denoted by (a, b) and called the open interval from a to b. This notation naturally creates some ambiguity, since (a, b) is also used to denote a pair of numbers, but in context it is always clear (or can easily be made clear) whether one is talking about a pair or an interval. Note that if a > b, then (a, b) = ∅, the set with no elements; in practice, however, it is almost always assumed (explicitly if one has been careful, and implicitly otherwise), that whenever an interval (a, b) is mentioned, the number a is less than b.

    The set {x : a < x < b} is denoted by [a, b] and is called the closed interval from a to b. This symbol is usually reserved for the case a < b, but it is sometimes used for a = b, also. The usual pictures for the intervals (a, b) and [a, b] are shown in Figure 3; since no reasonably accurate picture could ever indicate the difference between the two intervals, various conventions have been adopted. Figure 3 also shows certain "infinite" intervals. The set {x : x > a} is denoted by (a, ∞), while the set {x : x ≥ a} is denoted by [a, ∞); the sets (−∞, a) and (−∞, a] are defined similarly. At this point a standard warning must be issued: the symbols ∞ and −∞, though usually read "infinity" and "minus infinity," are purely suggestive; there is no number "∞" which satisfies ∞ > a for all numbers a. While the symbols ∞ and −∞ will appear in many contexts, it is always necessary to define these uses in ways that refer only to numbers. The set R of all real numbers is also considered to be an "interval," and is sometimes denoted by (−∞, ∞).

    Of even greater interest to us than the method of drawing numbers is a method  
    of drawing pairs of numbers. This procedure, probably also familiar to you, re-  
    quires a "coordinate system," two straight lines intersecting at right angles. To  
    distinguish these straight lines, we call one the horizontal axis, and one the vertical  
    axis. (More prosaic terminology, such as the "first" and "second" axes, is probably  
    preferable from a logical point of view, but most people hold their books, or at  
    least their blackboards, in the same way, so that "horizontal" and "vertical" are  
    more descriptive.) Each of the two axes could be labeled with real numbers, but  
    we can also label points on the horizontal axis with pairs (a, 0) and points on the  
    vertical axis with pairs (0, b), so that the intersection of the two axes, the "origin"  
    of the coordinate system, is labeled (0,0). Any pair (a, b) can now be drawn as  
    in Figure 4, lying at the vertex of the rectangle whose other three vertices are la-  
    beled (0, 0), (a, 0), and (0, b). ‘The numbers a and b are called the first and second  
    coordinates, respectively, of the point determined in this way.
    
    Our real concern, let us recall, is a method of drawing functions. Since a func-  
    tion is just a collection of pairs of numbers, we can draw a function by drawing  
    each of the pairs in the function. ‘The drawing obtained in this way is called the  
    graph of the function. In other words, the graph of f contains all the points cor-  
    responding to pairs (x, f(x)). Since most functions contain infinitely many pairs,  
    drawing the graph promises to be a laborious undertaking, but, in fact, many  
    functions have graphs which are quite easy to draw.
    
    Not surprisingly, the simplest functions of all, the constant functions f(x) = c,  
    have the simplest graphs. It is easy to see that the graph of the function f(x) =c  
    is a straight line parallel to the horizontal axis, at distance c from it (Figure 5).
  - |-
    The functions f(x) = cx also have particularly simple graphs—straight lines through (0,0), as in Figure 6. A proof of this fact is indicated in Figure 7:

    Let x be some number not equal to 0, and let L be the straight line which passes
    through the origin O, corresponding to (0,0), and through the point A, corre-
    sponding to (x,cx). A point A', with first coordinate y, will lie on L when the
    triangle A'B'O is similar to the triangle ABO, thus when

    this is precisely the condition that A' corresponds to the pair (y, cy), i.e., that A'
    lies on the graph of f. The argument has implicitly assumed that c > 0, but the
    other cases are treated easily enough. The number c, which measures the ratio of
    the sides of the triangles appearing in the proof, is called the slope of the straight
    line, and a line parallel to this line is also said to have slope c.
  - |-
    This demonstration has neither been labeled nor treated as a formal proof. Indeed, a rigorous demonstration would necessitate a digression which we are not at all prepared to follow. 'The rigorous proof of any statement connecting geometric and algebraic concepts would first require a real proof (or a precisely stated assumption) that the points on a straight line correspond in an exact way to the real numbers. Aside from this, it would be necessary to develop plane geometry as precisely as we intend to develop the properties of real numbers. Now the detailed development of plane geometry is a beautiful subject, but it is by no means a prerequisite for the study of calculus. We shall use geometric pictures only as an aid to intuition; for our purposes (and for most of mathematics) it is perfectly satisfactory to define the plane to be the set of all pairs of real numbers, and to define straight lines as certain collections of pairs, including, among others, the collections {(x, cx) : x a real number}. 'To provide this artificially constructed geometry with all the structure of geometry studied in high school, one more definition is required. If (a,b) and (c,d) are two points in the plane, that is, pairs of real numbers, we define the distance between (a, b) and (c, d) to be
    
    √[(a−c)² + (b−d)²].
    
    If the motivation for this definition is not clear, Figure 8 should serve as adequate explanation—with this definition the Pythagorean theorem has been built into our geometry.*
    
    Reverting once more to our informal geometric picture, it is not hard to see (Figure 9) that the graph of the function f(x) = cx + d is a straight line with slope c, passing through the point (0,d). For this reason, the functions f(x) = cx +d are called linear functions. Simple as they are, linear functions occur frequently, and you should feel comfortable working with them. The following is a typical problem whose solution should not cause any trouble. Given two distinct points (a, b) and (c,d), find the linear function f whose graph goes through (a, b) and (c,d). This amounts to saying that f(a) = b and f(c) =d. If

    * The fastidious reader might object to this definition on the grounds that nonnegative numbers are not yet known to have square roots. This objection is really unanswerable at the moment-~ the definition will just have to be accepted with reservations, until this little pot is settled.

    f is to be of the form f(x) = ax + B, then we must have
    
    aa+ B=b,
    ac+ BpB=d;
    therefore a = (d — b)/(c — a) and B = b — |(d — b)/(c — a) |a, so
    fe) = en pt rg a ue) +,
    c—a c—a c—a
    
    a formula most easily remembered by using the "point-slope form" (see Problem 6).
    
    Of course, this solution is possible only if a 4 c; the graphs of linear functions account only for the straight lines which are not parallel to the vertical axis. The vertical straight lines are not the graph of any function at all; in fact, the graph of a function can never contain even two distinct points on the same vertical line. ‘This conclusion 1s immediate from the definition of a function—two points on the same vertical line correspond to pairs of the form (a, b) and (a,c) and, by definition, a function cannot contain (a, b) and (a,c) if b # c. Conversely, if a set of points in the plane has the property that no two points lie on the same vertical line, then it is surely the graph of a function. Thus, the first two sets in Figure 10 are not graphs of functions and the last two are; notice that the fourth is the graph of a function whose domain 1s not all of R, since some vertical lines have no poits on them at all.
    
    After the linear functions the simplest is perhaps the function f(x) = x*. If we draw some of the pairs in f, 1.e., some of the pairs of the form (x, x7), we obtain a picture hike Figure 11.

    It is not hard to convince yourself that all the pairs (x, x') lie along a curve like
    the one shown in Figure 12; this curve is known as a parabola.
    
    Since a graph is just a drawing on paper, made (in this case) with printer's ink,
    the question "Is this what the graph really looks like?" is hard to phrase in any
    sensible manner. No drawing is ever really correct since the line has thickness.
    Nevertheless, there are some questions which one can ask: for example, how can
    you be sure that the graph does not look like one of the drawings in Figure 13?
    It is easy to see, and even to prove, that the graph cannot look like (a); for if
    0 <x < y, then x* < y', so the graph should be higher at y than at x, which is
    not the case in (a) . It is also easy to see, simply by drawing a very accurate graph,
    first plotting many pairs (x, x*), that the graph cannot have a large "jump" as in (b)
    or a "corner" as in (c). In order to prove these assertions, however, we first need
    to say, in a mathematical way, what it means for a function not to have a "jump"
    or "corner"; these ideas already involve some of the fundamental concepts of
    calculus. Eventually we will be able to define them rigorously, but meanwhile you
    may amuse yourself by attempting to define these concepts, and then examining
    your definitions critically. Later these definitions may be compared with the ones
    mathematicians have agreed upon. If they compare favorably, you are certainly
    to be congratulated!
    
    The functions f(x) = x^n, for various natural numbers n, are sometimes called
    power functions. Their graphs are most easily compared as in Figure 14, by
    drawing several at once.
    
    The power functions are only special cases of polynomial functions, introduced
    in the previous chapter. Two particular polynomial functions are graphed in

    In general, the graph of f will have at most n — 1 "peaks" or "valleys" (a "peak"
    is a point like (x, f(x)) in Figure 16, while a "valley" is a point like (y, f(y)). The
    number of peaks and valleys may actually be much smaller (the power functions,
    for example, have at most one valley). Although these assertions are easy to make,
    we will not even contemplate giving proofs until Part III (once the powerful meth-
    ods of Part III are available, the proofs will be very easy).
    
    Figure 17 illustrates the graphs of several rational functions. ‘The rational func-
    tions exhibit even greater variety than the polynomial functions, but their behavior
    will also be easy to analyze once we can use the derivative, the basic tool of Part III.
    
    Many interesting graphs can be constructed by "piecing together" the graphs of
    functions already studied. The graph in Figure 18 is made up entirely of straight
    lines. The function f with this graph satisfies

    (The number 0 is not in the domain of f.) Of course, one can write out an explicit
    formula for f(x), when x is in [1/(n + 1), 1/n]; this is a good exercise in the use
    of linear functions, and will also convince you that a picture is worth a thousand
    words.

    It is actually possible to define, in a much simpler way, a function which exhibits  
    this same property of oscillating infinitely often near O, by using the sine function,  
    which we will discuss in detail in Chapter 15. As usual, we are using radian  
    measure, so an angle of 2π means an angle "all the way around" a circle, an  
    angle of π is an angle half way around (or 180° in layman's terms), an angle of π/2  
    a right angle, etc.

    An interesting modification of this function is f(x) = x sin(1/x). The graph of
    this function is sketched in Figure 21. Since sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely often near O
    between | and —1, the function f(x) = x sin(1/x) oscillates infinitely often between
    x and —x. The behavior of the graph for x large or large negative is harder to

    analyze. Since sin(1/x) is getting close to 0, while x is getting larger and larger, there
    seems to be no telling what the product will do. It is possible to decide, but this is
    another question that is best deferred to Part III. The graph of f(x) = x² sin(1/x)
    has also been illustrated (Figure 22).
    
    For these infinitely oscillating functions, it is clear that the graph cannot hope to
    be really "accurate." The best we can do is to show part of it, and leave out the
    part near 0 (which is the interesting part). Actually, it is easy to find much simpler
    functions whose graphs cannot be "accurately" drawn. The graphs of

    The graph of f must contain infinitely many points on the horizontal axis and  
    also infinitely many points on a line parallel to the horizontal axis, but it must not  
    contain either of these lines entirely. Figure 24 shows the usual textbook picture  
    of the graph. To distinguish the two parts of the graph, the dots are placed closer  
    together on the line corresponding to irrational x. (There is actually a mathemat-

    introduced in Problems 21-5 and 21-6.)
    
    The peculiarities exhibited by some functions are so engrossing that it is easy  
    to forget some of the simplest, and most important, subsets of the plane, which  
    are not the graphs of functions. The most important example of all is the circle.  
    A circle with center (a, b) and radius r > 0 contains, by definition, all the points  
    (x, y) whose distance from (a, b) is equal to r. The circle thus consists (Figure 25)  
    of all points (x, y) with
    
    $$
    \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2} = r
    $$
    
    or  
    $$
    (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2
    $$
    
    The circle with center (0,0) and radius 1, often regarded as a sort of standard copy,  
    is called the unit circle.
    
    A close relative of the circle is the ellipse. This is defined as the set of points,  
    the sum of whose distances from two "focus" points is a constant. (When the two  
    foci are the same, we obtain a circle.) If, for convenience, the focus points are  
    taken to be (−c, 0) and (c, 0), and the sum of the distances is taken to be 2a (the  
    factor 2 simplifies some algebra), then (x, y) is on the ellipse if and only if
    
    $$
    \sqrt{(x + c)^2 + y^2} + \sqrt{(x - c)^2 + y^2} = 2a

    and it intersects the vertical axis when x = Q, so that  
    y?  
    
    The hyperbola is defined analogously, except that we require the difference of  
    the two distances to be constant. Choosing the points (—c, 0) and (c,0) once  
    again, and the constant difference as 2a, we obtain, as the condition that (x, y)  
    be on the hyperbola,  
    Vix to +y2—V(x —c)? + y? = 42a,  
    which may be simplified to

    In this case, however, we must clearly choose c > a, so that a*—c? < 0. If  
    b= JV c* — a", then (x, y) is on the hyperbola if and only if
  - |-
    The picture is shown in Figure 27. It contains two pieces, because the difference between the distances of (x, y) from (—c, 0) and (c, 0) may be taken in two different orders. The hyperbola intersects the horizontal axis when y = 0, so that x = a, but it never intersects the vertical axis.
    
    It is interesting to compare (Figure 28) the hyperbola with a = b = √(1/2) and the graph of the function f(x) = 1/x. The drawings look quite similar, and the two sets are actually identical, except for a rotation through an angle of π/4 (Problem 23).
    
    Clearly no rotation of the plane will change circles or ellipses into the graphs of functions. Nevertheless, the study of these important geometric figures can often be reduced to the study of functions. Ellipses, for example, are made up of the
    
    f(x) = -b√(1 - (x²/a²)), -a < x < a
    
    and
    
    g(x) = b√(1 - (x²/a²)), -a < x < a.
    
    Of course, there are many other pairs of functions with this same property. For example, we can take
    
    f(x) = b√(1 - (x²/a²)), 0 < x < a
    g(x) = -b√(1 - (x²/a²)), -a < x < 0
    and
    f(x) = -b√(1 - (x²/a²)), 0 < x < a
    g(x) = b√(1 - (x²/a²)), -a < x < 0.
    
    We could also choose
    
    f(x) = b√(1 - (x²/a²)), x rational, -a < x < a
    g(x) = -b√(1 - (x²/a²)), x irrational, -a < x < a
    and
    f(x) = -b√(1 - (x²/a²)), x rational, -a < x < a
    g(x) = b√(1 - (x²/a²)), x irrational, -a < x < a.

    But all these other pairs necessarily involve unreasonable functions which jump
    around. A proof, or even a precise statement of this fact, is too difficult at present.
    Although you have probably already begun to make a distinction between those
    functions with reasonable graphs, and those with unreasonable graphs, you may
    find it very difficult to state a reasonable definition of reasonable functions. A
    mathematical definition of this concept is by no means easy, and a great deal of this
    book may be viewed as successive attempts to impose more and more conditions
    that a "reasonable" function must satisfy. As we define some of these conditions,
    we will take time out to ask if we have really succeeded in isolating the functions
    which deserve to be called reasonable. The answer, unfortunately, will always be
    "no," or at best, a qualified "yes."

    form" is far more convenient than the equivalent expression f(x) =

    slope is m, and that the value of f at a is b.
    
    For a ≠ c, show that the straight line through (a, b) and (c,d) is the

    you through the following problem, and others which occur before Chapter 23.

    decimal ending in a string of 9's is equal to another ending in a string of 0's (e.g.,

    APPENDIX 1. VECTORS
    
    Suppose that v is a point in the plane; in other words, v is a pair of numbers
  - |-
    Vv = (VJ, U2).
    
    For convenience, we will use this convention that subscripts indicate the first and
    second pairs of a point that has been described by a single letter. Thus, if we
    mention the points w and z, it will be understood that w is the pair (w1, w2),
    while z is the pair (z1, z2).
    
    Instead of the actual pair of numbers (v1, v2), we often picture v as an arrow
    from the origin O to this point (Figure 1), and we refer to these arrows as vectors
    in the plane. Of course, we've haven't really said anything new yet, we've simply
    introduced an alternate term for a point of the plane, and another mental picture.
    The real point of the new terminology is to emphasize that we are going to do
    some new things with points in the plane.
    
    For example, suppose that we have two vectors (i.e., points) in the plane,
    
    v = (v1, v2), w = (w1, w2).
    Then we can define a new vector (a new point of the plane) v + w by the equation
    (1) v + w = (v1 + w1, v2 + w2).
    
    Notice that all the letters on the right side of this equation are numbers, and the
    + sign is just our usual addition of numbers. On the other hand, the + sign on
    the left side is new: previously, the sum of two points in the plane wasn't defined,
    and we've simply used equation (1) as a definition.
    
    A very fussy mathematician might want to use some new symbol for this newly
    defined operation, like
    v ⊕ w or perhaps v @ w,
    
    but there's really no need to insist on this; since v + w hasn't been defined before,
    there's no possibility of confusion, so we might as well keep the notation simple.
    Of course, any one can make new notation; for example, since it's our definition,
    we could just as well have defined v + w as (v1 + w1, v2 + w2), or by some
    other equally weird formula. The real question is, does our new construction have
    any particular significance?
    Figure 2 shows two vectors v and w, as well as the point
  - |-
    (v1 + w1, v2 + w2),
    
    which, for the moment, we have simply indicated in the usual way, without drawing
    an arrow. Note that it is easy to compute the slope of the line L between v and
    our new point: as indicated in Figure 2, this slope is just
    
    (v2 + w2) − v2
    (w2) − v2
    
    and this, of course, is the slope of our vector w, from the origin O to (w1, w2). In
    other words, the line L is parallel to w.

    Similarly, the slope of the line M between (w1, w2) and our new point is
    
    (v2 + w2) − w2
    (v1 + w1) − w1
    
    which is the slope of the vector v; so M is parallel to v. In short, the new point
    v + w lies on the parallelogram having v and w as sides. When we draw v + w as
    an arrow (Figure 3), it points along the diagonal of this parallelogram. In physics,
    vectors are used to symbolize forces, and the sum of two vectors represents the
    resultant force when two different forces are applied simultaneously to the same
    object.
    
    Figure 4 shows another way of visualizing the sum v + w. If we use "w" to denote
    an arrow parallel to w, and having the same length, but starting at v instead of at
    the origin, then v + w is the vector from O to the final endpoint; thus we get to
    v + w by first following v, and then following w.
    
    Many of the properties of + for ordinary numbers also hold for this new + for
    vectors. For example, the "commutative law"
    
    v + w = w + v,
    
    is obvious from the geometric picture, since the parallelogram spanned by v and
    w is the same as the parallelogram spanned by w and v. It is also easily checked
    analytically, since it states that
  - |-
    (V] + W1, 02 + W2) = (W] + UV}, W2 + 2),
    and thus simply depends on the commutative law for numbers:
    
    vj + WwW, = w+ YY,
    v2 + W2 = W2 + U2.
    
    Similarly, unraveling definitions, we find the "associative law"
    [ut+w]t+z=v+[wtz|].
    
    Figure 5 indicates a method of finding v + w + z.
    The origin O = (0, 0) is an "additive identity,"
    
    O+v=vt+O =v,
    and if we define
    
    —-vU= (—v], —vU?2),
    
    then we also have
    v+(—v)=-vt+ve= 0.
    
    Naturally we can also define
    w—-v=w+(—-v),
    exactly as with numbers; equivalently,
    
    wW—v= (WwW) — UV], W2 — U2).

    Just as with numbers, our definition of w — v simply means that it satisfies
    v+(w—v)=w.
    
    Figure 6(a) shows v and an arrow "w — v" that is parallel to w — v but that starts
    at the endpoint of v. As we established with Figure 4, the vector from the origin
    to the endpoint of this arrow 1s just v + (w — v) = w (Figure 6(b)). In other words,
    we Can picture w — v geometrically as the arrow that goes from v to w (except that
    it must then be moved back to the origin).
    
    There is also a way of multiplying a number by a vector: For a number a and
    a vector v = (v], v2), we define
    
    a-v = (av), av)

    (We sometimes simply write av instead of a - vu; of course, it is then especially important to remember that v denotes a vector, rather than a number.) The vector a -v points in the same direction as v when a > O and in the opposite direction when a < O (Figure 7).
    
    The vector a -v points in the same direction as v when a > O and in the opposite direction when a < O (Figure 7).

    a-(b-v)=(ab)-v,
    
    l-v=v,
    QO-v=0O,
    —l-v=-—v.
    
    Notice that we have only defined a product of a number and a vector, we have not defined a way of ‘multiplying' two vectors, to get another vector.* However, there are various ways of ‘multiplying' vectors to get numbers, which are explored in the following problems.
    
    PROBLEMS
    
    1. Given a point v of the plane, let Rg(v) be the result of rotating v around the origin through an angle of 6 (Figure 8). ‘The aim of this problem is to obtain a formula for Rg, with minimal calculation.
    
    (a) Show that
    
    Re(1, 0) = (cos 8, sin 8), [we should really write Rg((1, 0)), etc.]
    Ro (0, 1) = (— sin 9, cos @).
    
    (b) Explain why we have
    
    Ro(vu + w) = Re(v) + Ro(w),
    Rg(a-w) =a: Ro(w).
    
    (c) Now show that for any point (x, y) we have
    
    Ro(x, y) = (x cos@ — ysin6@, x sin@ + ycos@).
    
    *If you jump to Chapter 25, you'll find that there is an important way of defining a product, but
    this is something very special for the plane—it doesn't work for vectors in 3-space, for example, even
    though the other constructions do.

    (d) Use this result to give another solution to Problem 4-23.
    
    Given v and w, we define the number
    VeW= VW, + 022;
    
    this is often called the ‘dot product' or ‘scalar product' of v and w (‘scalar'
    being a rather old-fashioned word for a number, as opposed to a vector).

    (a) Given $ v $, find a vector $ w $ such that $ v - w = 0 $. Now describe the set of all such vectors $ w $.

    $$
    v \cdot (w + z) = v \cdot w + v \cdot z

    and that

    a - (v - w) = (a - v) - w = a \cdot v - (a - w).
    $$
    Notice that the last of these equations involves three products: the dot product - of two vectors; the product - of a number and a vector; and the ordinary product - of two numbers.
    
    (c) Show that $ v \cdot v > 0 $, and that $ v \cdot v = 0 $ only when $ v = 0 $. Hence we can define the norm $ ||v|| $ as
    $$
    ||v|| = \sqrt{v \cdot v},
    $$
    which will be 0 only for $ v = 0 $. What is the geometric interpretation of the norm?

    ||v + w|| \leq ||v|| + ||w||
    $$
    and that equality holds if and only if $ v = 0 $ or $ w = 0 $ or $ w = a - v $ for some number $ a > 0 $.
    
    (e) Show that

    \frac{v \cdot w}{||v|| \cdot ||w||} = \cos \theta,

    where $ \theta $ is the angle between $ v $ and $ w $.
    
    (a) Let $ R_\theta $ be rotation by an angle of $ \theta $ (Problem 1). Show that
    $$
    R_\theta(v) + R_\theta(w) = R_\theta(v + w).
    $$
    
    (b) Let $ e = (1, 0) $ be the vector of length 1 pointing along the first axis, and let $ w = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta) $; this is a vector of length 1 that makes an angle of $ \theta $ with the first axis (compare Problem 1). Calculate that
    $$
    e \cdot w = \cos \theta.
    $$
    Conclude that in general
    $$
    v \cdot w = ||v|| \cdot ||w|| \cdot \cos \theta,

    where $ \theta $ is the angle between $ v $ and $ w $.

    Given two vectors v and w, we'd expect to have a simple formula, involving
    the coordinates v1, v2, w1, w2, for the area of the parallelogram they span.
    Figure 9 indicates a strategy for finding such a formula: since the triangle
    with vertices O, A, v + w is congruent to the triangle OBv, we can reduce
    the problem to an easier one where one side of the parallelogram lies along
    the horizontal axis:
    
    (a) The line L passes through v and is parallel to w, so has slope w2/w1.
    Conclude that the point B has coordinate
    
    B = (w1 - v1*w2/w1, w2)
    
    and that the parallelogram therefore has area
    
    det(v, w) = v1*w2 - v2*w1.
    
    This formula, which defines the determinant det, certainly seems to be simple
    enough, but it can't really be true that det(v, w) always gives the area. After
    all, we clearly have |
    
    det(w, v) = - det(v, w),
    
    so sometimes det will be negative! Indeed, it is easy to see that our "deriva-
    tion" made all sorts of assumptions (that w2 was positive, that B had a positive
    coordinate, etc.) Nevertheless, it seems likely that det(v, w) is + the area; the
    next problem gives an independent proof.
    
    (a) If v points along the positive horizontal axis, show that det(v, w) is the
    area of the parallelogram spanned by v and w for w above the horizontal
    axis (w2 > 0), and the negative of the area for w below this axis.
    
    (b) If R is rotation by an angle of θ (Problem 1), show that
    
    det(Rv, Rw) = det(v, w).
    
    Conclude that det(v, w) is the area of the parallelogram spanned by
    v and w when the rotation from v to w is counterclockwise, and the
    negative of the area when it is clockwise.
    
    Show that
    
    det(v, w + z) = det(v, w) + det(v, z)
    det(v + w, z) = det(v, z) + det(w, z)

    and that  
    a det(v, w) = det(a- v, w) = det(v,a- w).
    
    Using the method of Problem 3, show that  
    det(v, w) = |lull - ||] - sin 8,  
    
    which is also obvious from the geometric interpretation (Figure 10).

    APPENDIX 2. THE CONIC SECTIONS  
    
    Although we will be concerned almost exclusively with figures in the plane,  
    defined formally as the set of all pairs of real numbers, in this Appendix we want  
    to consider three-dimensional space, which we can describe in terms of triples of  
    real numbers, using a "three-dimensional coordinate system," consisting of three  
    straight lines intersecting at right angles (Figure 1). Our horizontal and vertical axes  
    
    (0, 1, 0) now mutate to two axes in a horizontal plane, with the third axis perpendicular to  
    ; both.  
    (1, 0, 0) One of the simplest subsets of this three-dimensional space is the (infinite) cone  
    illustrated in Figure 2; this cone may be produced by rotating a "generating line,"  
    FICURE 1 of slope C say, around the third axis.  
    
    (0,0, 1)¢

    For any given first two coordinates x and y, the point (x, y, 0) in the horizontal  
    
    plane has distance Vx? 4 y* from the origin, and thus  
    (1) (x, y, Zz) 1s on the cone if and only if z = +CVvx2 + y'.  
    
    We can descend from these three-dimensional vistas to the more familiar two-  
    dimensional one by asking what happens when we intersect this cone with some  
    plane P (Figure 3).  
    
    FIGURE 3  
    
    If the plane is parallel to the horizontal plane, there's certainly no mystery—the  
    intersection is just a circle. Otherwise, the plane P intersects the horizontal plane

    In a straight line. We can make things a lot simpler for ourselves if we rotate
    everything around the vertical axis so that this intersection line points straight out
    from the plane of the paper, while the first axis is in the usual position that we
    are familiar with. The plane P is thus viewed "straight on," so that all we see
    (Figure 4) is its intersection L with the plane of the first and third axes; from this
    view-point the cone itself simply appears as two straight lines.
    
    If this line L happens to be vertical, consisting of all points (a, z) for some a,
    then equation (1) says that the intersection of the cone and the plane consists of
    all points (a, y, z) with
    
    2 Cy? = C22,
    
    which is an hyperbola.
    Otherwise, in the plane of the first and third axes, the line L can be described
    as the collection of all points of the form
    
    (x, Mx+ B),
    where M is the slope of L. For an arbitrary point (x, y, z) it follows that
    (2) (x, y,z) is in the plane P if and only if z= Mx + B.
    
    Combining (1) and (2), we see that (x, y, z) is in the intersection of the cone and
    the plane if and only if
    
    (x) Mx +B =+Cv x2 + y?.
    
    Now we have to choose coordinate axes in the plane P. We can choose L as the
    first axis, measuring distances from the intersection Q with the horizontal plane
    (Figure 5); for the second axis we just choose the line through Q parallel to our
    original second axis. If the first coordinate of a point in P with respect to these
    axes is x, then the first coordinate of this point with respect to the original axes
    can be written in the form
    
    ax + B
    
    for some a and B. On the other hand, if the second coordinate of the point with
    respect to these axes is y, then y is also the second coordinate with respect to the
    original axes.
    
    Consequently, (*) says that the point lies on the intersection of the plane and the
    cone if and only if
  - |-
    M(x + B) + B=+CV(ax +B)? + y?.
    Although this looks fairly complicated, after squaring we can write this as
    Cy? —a*(M* —C')x? + Ex+F=0
    
    for some E and F that we won't bother writing out.
    Now Problem 4-16 indicates that this is either a parabola, an ellipse, or an
    hyperbola. In fact, looking a little more closely at the solution, we see that the

    values of E and F are irrelevant:
    
    (1) If M =+C we obtain a parabola;
    (2) If C* > M? we obtain an ellipse;
    (3) If C? < M? we obtain an hyperbola.
    
    These analytic conditions are easy to interpret geometrically (Figure 6):
    
    (1) If our plane is parallel to one of the generating lines of the cone we obtain
    a parabola;
    
    (2) If our plane slopes less than the generating line of the cone (so that our
    intersection omits one half of the cone) we obtain an ellipse;
    
    (3) If our plane slopes more than the generating line of the cone we obtain an
    
    hyperbola.

    In fact, the very names of these "conic sections" are related to this description.
    The word parabola comes from a Greek root meaning ‘alongside,' the same root
    that appears in parable, not to mention paradigm, paradox, paragon, paragraph,
    paralegal, parallax, parallel, and even parachute. Ellipse comes from a Greek root
    meaning ‘defect,' or omission, as in ellipsis (an omission, ... or the dots that in-
    dicate it). And hyperbola comes from a Greek root meaning ‘throwing beyond,' or
    excess. With the currency of words like hyperactive, hypersensitive, and hyperven-
    tilate, not to mention hype, one can probably say, without risk of hyperbole, that
    this root 1s familiar to almost everyone.*

    APPENDIX 3. POLAR COORDINATES
  - |-
    In this chapter we've been acting all along as if there's only one way to label
    points in the plane with pairs of numbers. Actually, there are many different
    ways, each giving rise to a different "coordinate system." The usual coordinates
    of a point are called its cartesian coordinates, after the French mathematician
    and philosopher René Descartes (1596-1650), who first introduced the idea of
    coordinate systems. In many situations it is more convenient to introduce polar
    coordinates, which are illustrated in Figure 1. To the point P we assign the polar
    coordinates (r,θ), where r is the distance from the origin O to P, and θ is the
    measure, in radians, of the angle between the horizontal axis and the line from
    O to P. This θ is not determined unambiguously. For example, points on the
    right side of the horizontal axis could have either θ = 0 or θ = 2π; moreover, θ
    is completely ambiguous at the origin O. So it is necessary to exclude some ray
    through the origin if we want to assign a unique pair (r,θ) to each point under
    consideration.
    
    On the other hand, there is no problem associating a unique point to any pair
    (r,θ). In fact, it is possible (though not approved of by all) to associate a point
    to (r,θ) when r < 0, according to the scheme indicated in Figure 2. Thus, it
    always makes sense to talk about "the point with polar coordinates (r, θ)," (with
    or without the possibility of r < 0), even though there is some ambiguity when we
    talk about "the polar coordinates" of a given point.

    It is clear from Figure 1 (and Figure 2) that the point with polar coordinates
    (r,θ) has cartesian coordinates (x, y) given by
    
    x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ.

    Conversely, if a point has Cartesian coordinates (x, y), then (any of) its polar coordinates (r, θ) satisfy
    
    r = √(x² + y²)
    
    tanθ = y/x if x ≠ 0.
    
    Now suppose that f is a function. Then by the graph of f in polar coordinates we mean the collection of all points P with polar coordinates (r, θ) satisfying r = f(θ). In other words, the graph of f in polar coordinates is the collection of all points with polar coordinates (f(θ), θ). No special significance should be attached to the fact that we are considering pairs (f(θ), θ), with f(θ) first, as opposed to pairs (x, f(x)) in the usual graph of f; it is purely a matter of convention that r is considered the first polar coordinate and θ is considered the second.
    
    The graph of f in polar coordinates is often described as "the graph of the equation r = f(θ)." For example, suppose that f is a constant function, f(θ) = a for all θ. The graph of the equation r = a is simply a circle with center O and radius a (Figure 3). This example illustrates, in a rather blatant way, that polar coordinates are likely to make things simpler in situations that involve symmetry with respect to the origin O.
    
    The graph of the equation r = θ is shown in Figure 4. "The solid line corresponds to all values of θ > 0, while the dashed line corresponds to values of θ < 0.

    As another example involving both positive and negative r, consider the graph of the equation r = cosθ. Figure 5(a) shows the part that corresponds to 0 < θ < π/2. Figure 5(b) shows the part corresponding to π/2 < θ < π; here r < 0. You can check that no new points are added for θ > π/2 or θ < 0. It is easy to describe this same graph in terms of the Cartesian coordinates of its points. Since the polar coordinates of any point on the graph satisfy
    
    r = cosθ,

    its cartesian coordinates satisfy the equation
    $ x^2 + y^2 = X $
    
    which describes a circle (Problem 4-16). [Conversely, it is clear that if the cartesian
    coordinates of a point satisfy $ x^2 + y^2 = X $, then it lies on the graph of the equation
    $ r = \cos 0 $.]
    
    Although we've now gotten a circle in two different ways, we might well be
    hesitant about trying to find the equation of an ellipse in polar coordinates. But
    it turns out that we can get a very nice equation if we choose one of the foci as
    the origin. Figure 6 shows an ellipse with one focus at O, with the sum of the
    distances of all points from O and the other focus f being 2a. We've chosen f to
    be the left of O, with coordinates written as
    
    $ (-2ea, 0) $.
    
    (We have $ 0 < e < 1 $, since we must have $ 2a > $ distance from f to O).
    
    $ (x, y) $
    $ 2a - F/r r $
    $ f = (-2ea, 0) $ O
    $ a $
    
    FIGURE 6
    
    The distance r from (x, y) to O is given by
    (1) $ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} $,
    By assumption, the distance from (x, y) to f is $ 2a - r $, hence
    (2a - r)^2 = (x - [ -2ea ])^2 + y^2,
    or
    (2) $ 4a^2 - 4ar + r^2 = x^2 + 4eax + 4e^2a^2 + y^2 $.
    Subtracting (1) from (2), and dividing by 4a, we get
    
    $ a - r = ex + t + e^2a $.
    Wait, I think there might be a typo in the original text here. Let me correct that.
    
    From subtracting (1) from (2), we get:
    
    $ 4a^2 - 4ar + r^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = x^2 + 4eax + 4e^2a^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) $
    
    Simplifying both sides:
    
    Left side: $ 4a^2 - 4ar + r^2 - (x^2 + y^2) $
    
    Right side: $ x^2 + 4eax + 4e^2a^2 + y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = 4eax + 4e^2a^2 $
    
    So:
    
    $ 4a^2 - 4ar + r^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 4eax + 4e^2a^2 $
    
    But from (1): $ r^2 = x^2 + y^2 $, so we can substitute that into the left side:
    
    $ 4a^2 - 4ar + (x^2 + y^2) - (x^2 + y^2) = 4eax + 4e^2a^2 $
    
    Simplify:
    
    $ 4a^2 - 4ar = 4eax + 4e^2a^2 $
    
    Divide both sides by 4a:
    
    $ a - r = ex + e^2a $
    
    Then solving for r:
    
    $ r = a - ex - e^2a $
    
    Which we can write as
    
    (3) $ r = (1 - e^2)a - ex $
    
    Substituting $ r \cos\theta $ for x, we have
    
    $ r = (1 - e^2)a - ex $
    
    $ r \cos\theta = (1 - e^2)a - e x $
    
    But $ x = r \cos\theta $, so:
    
    $ r \cos\theta = (1 - e^2)a - e r \cos\theta $
    
    Rearranging:
    
    $ r \cos\theta + e r \cos\theta = (1 - e^2)a $
    
    $ r \cos\theta (1 + e) = (1 - e^2)a $
    
    Note that $ 1 - e^2 = (1 - e)(1 + e) $, so:
    
    $ r \cos\theta (1 + e) = (1 - e)(1 + e)a $
    
    Divide both sides by $ 1 + e $:
    
    $ r \cos\theta = (1 - e)a $
    
    But this is not quite the form we want. Let me re-express the original equation again.
    
    From earlier:
    
    $ r = (1 - e^2)a - ex $
    
    Substituting $ x = r \cos\theta $, we have:
    
    $ r = (1 - e^2)a - e r \cos\theta $
    
    Rearranging:
    
    $ r + e r \cos\theta = (1 - e^2)a $
    
    Factor out r:
    
    $ r(1 + e \cos\theta) = (1 - e^2)a $
    
    Therefore:
    
    $ r = \frac{(1 - e^2)a}{1 + e \cos\theta} $
    
    Which we can write as
    
    (4) $ r = \frac{A}{1 + e \cos\theta} $, for $ A = (1 - e^2)a $
    
    In Chapter 4 we found that
    $ \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 $

    Since the distance between the foci is 2c, when this ellipse is moved left by c units, so that the focus (c, 0) is now at the origin, we get the ellipse (4) when we

    **PROVISIONAL DEFINITION**
    
    **LIMITS**
    
    The concept of a limit is surely the most important, and probably the most difficult  
    one in all of calculus. The goal of this chapter is the definition of limits, but we  
    are, once more, going to begin with a provisional definition; what we shall define  
    is not the word "limit" but the notion of a function approaching a limit.  
    
    The function f approaches the limit L near a, if we can make f(x) as close as we  
    like to L by requiring that x be sufficiently close to, but unequal to, a.  
    
    Of the six functions graphed in Figure 1, only the first three approach L at a.  
    Notice that although g(a) is not defined, and h(a) is defined "the wrong way," it  
    is still true that g and h approach L near a. This is because we explicitly ruled  
    out, in our definition, the necessity of ever considering the value of the function  
    at a— it is only necessary that f(x) should be close to L for x close to a, but unequal  
    to a. We are simply not interested in the value of f(a), or even in the question of  
    
    whether f(a) is defined.

    One convenient way of picturing the assertion that f approaches / near a is provided by a method of drawing functions that was not mentioned in Chapter 4.
    In this method, we draw two straight lines, each representing R, and arrows from a point x in one, to f(x) in the other. Figure 2 illustrates such a picture for two different functions.

    Now consider a function f whose drawing looks like Figure 3. Suppose we ask that f(x) be close to J, say within the open interval B which has been drawn in Figure 3. This can be guaranteed if we consider only the numbers x in the interval A of Figure 3. (In this diagram we have chosen the largest interval which will work; any smaller interval containing a could have been chosen instead.) If we
    
    FIGURE 3 FIGURE 4
    
    A'
    
    choose a smaller interval B' (Figure 4) we will, usually, have to choose a smaller A', but no matter how small we choose the open interval B, there is always supposed to be some open interval A which works.
    
    A similar pictorial interpretation is possible in terms of the graph of f, but in this case the interval B must be drawn on the vertical axis, and the set A on the horizontal axis. The fact that f(x) is in B when x is in A means that the part of the graph lying over A is contained in the region which is bounded by the horizontal lines through the end points of B; compare Figure 5(a), where a valid interval A has been chosen, with Figure 5(b), where A is too large.

    ‘To take a specific simple example, let's consider the function f(x) = 3x with
    a = 5 (Figure 6). Presumably f should approach the limit 15 near 5—we ought
    to be able to get f(x) as close to 15 as we like if we require that x be sufficiently
    close to 5. ‘Io be specific, suppose we want to make sure that 3x is within ε of
    15. This means that we want to have
    
    |3x - 15| < ε,
    
    which we can also write as
    |3x - 15| < ε,
    or
    -ε < 3x - 15 < ε.
    
    ‘To do this we just have to require that
    |x - 5| < ε/3;
    
    or simply |x —5| < ε/3; There is nothing special about the number in: It is just as
    easy to guarantee that |3x — 15| < ε; simply require that |x — 5| < ε/3. In fact,
    if we take any positive number ε we can make |3x — 15| < ε simply by requiring
    that |x —5| < ε/3.
    
    There's also nothing special about the choice a = 5. It's just as easy to see that
    f approaches the limit 3a at a for any a: ‘To ensure that
    
    |3x —3a| < ε
    
    we just have to require that
    
    |x - a| < ε/3.
    
    Naturally, the same sort of argument works for the function f(x) = 3,000,000x.
    We just have to be 1,000,000 times as careful, choosing |x — a| < ε/3,000,000 in
    order to ensure that | f(x) — 3,000,000a| < ε.
    
    The function f(x) = x² is a little more interesting. Presumably, we should be
    able to show that f(x) approaches 9 near 3. This means that we need to show
    how to ensure the inequality
    
    |x² - 9| < ε
    
    for any given positive number ε by requiring |x — 3| to be small enough. The
    obvious first step is to write
    
    |x² - 9| = |x - 3||x + 3|.

    which gives us the useful |x — 3| factor. Unlike the situation with the previous
    examples, however, the extra factor here is |x +3], which isn't a convenient constant
    like 3 or 3,000,000. But the only crucial thing is to make sure that we can say
    something about how big |x + 3| is. So the first thing we'll do is to require that
    |x — 3| < 1. Once we've specified that |x — 3| < 1, or 2 < x < 4, we have
    5 <x+3 <7 and we've guaranteed that |x + 3| < 7. So we now have
    
    |x² —9| = |x —3| · |x +3| < 7|x — 3|,
    
    5. Limits 93
    
    which shows that we have |x² — 9| < ε for |x — 3| < ε/7, provided that we've
    also required that |x — 3| < 1. Or, to make it look more official: we require that
    |x — 3| < min(ε/7, 1).
    
    The initial specification |x — 3| < 1 was simply made for convenience. We
    could just as well have specified that |x — 3| < ε or |x — 3| < 10 or any other
    convenient number. ‘To make sure you understand the reasoning in the previous
    paragraph, it is a good exercise to figure out how the argument would read if we
    chose |x — 3| < 10.
    
    Our argument to show that f approaches 9 near 3 will basically work to show
    that f approaches a' near a for any a, except that we need to worry a bit more
    about getting the proper inequality for |x + a|. We first require that |x — a| < 1,
    again with the expectation that this will ensure that |x + a| is not too large. In
    fact, Problem 1-12 shows that

    also have |x — a| < 1. Officially: we require that |x — a| < min(e/(2|a| + 1), 1).
    
    In contrast to this example, we'll now consider the function f(x) = I/x (for
    x #0), and try to show that f approaches 1/3 near 3. ‘This means that we need

    which shows that we have |1/x — 1/3| < ε for |x — 3| < 6ε, provided that we've  
    also required that |x — 3| < 1. Or, to make it look official again: we require that  
    |x — 3| < min(6ε, 1).  
    
    If we instead wanted to show that f approaches —1/3 near —3, we would begin  
    by stipulating that |x — (—3)| < 1, giving —4 < x < —2, once again implying that  
    |1/x| < 1/2, so that everything works as before.  
    
    To show in general that f approaches 1/a near a for any a we proceed in  
    basically the same way, except that, again, we have to be a little more careful  
    in formulating our initial stipulation. It's not good enough simply to require that  
    |x —a| should be less than 1, or any other particular number, because if a is close to  
    0 this would allow values of x that are negative (not to mention the embarrassing  
    possibility that x = 0, so that f(x) isn't even defined!).  
    
    The trick in this case is to first require that  
    
    |x —a| < |a|  
    in other words, we require that x be less than half as far from 0 as a (Figure 7).  
    You should be able to check first that x ≠ 0 and that 1/|x| < 2/|a|, and then work  
    out the rest of the argument.  
    
    With all the work required for these simple examples, you may have begun to  
    quail at the prospect of tackling even more complicated functions. But that won't  
    really be necessary, since we will eventually have some basic theorems that we can  
    rely on. Instead of worrying about the unpleasant algebra that might be involved  
    in functions like f(x) = x² or f(x) = 1/x², we'll turn our attention to some  
    examples that might appear to be even more frightening.

    Consider first the function f(x) = x sin(1/x) (Figure 8). Despite the erratic behavior of this function near 0 it is clear, at least intuitively, that f approaches 0 near a = 0 (remember that our provisional definition specifically exempts x = a from consideration, so it doesn't matter that this function isn't even defined at 0). We want to show that we can get f(x) = x sin(1/x) as close to 0 as desired if we require that x be sufficiently close to 0, but x ≠ 0. In other words, for any number ε > 0, we want to show that we can ensure that
    
    |f(x) − 0| = |x sin(1/x)| < ε
    
    by requiring that |x| = |x − 0| is sufficiently small (but x ≠ 0). But this is easy. Since
    
    |sin(1/x)| < 1 for all x ≠ 0,
    
    we have
    
    |x sin(1/x)| < |x|,
    
    for all x ≠ 0,
    
    so we can make |x sin(1/x)| < ε simply by requiring that |x| < ε and x ≠ 0.
    
    For the function f(x) = x^7 sin(1/x) (Figure 9) it seems even clearer that f approaches 0 near 0. If, for example, we want
    
    |x^7 sin(1/x)| < ε,
    
    then we certainly need only require that |x| < ε and x ≠ 0, since this implies that |x^7| < ε^7 and consequently
    
    |x^7 sin(1/x)| < |x^7| < ε^7.
    
    (We could do even better, and allow |x| < 1/10 and x ≠ 0, but there is no particular virtue in being as economical as possible.) In general, if ε > 0, to ensure that
    
    |x^7 sin(1/x)| < ε,
    
    we need only require that
    
    | x | < ε and x ≠ 0.

    As a third example, consider the function f(x) = /|x|sin1/x (Figure 10). In order to make |,/|x| sin 1/x| < € we can require that

    Finally, let us consider the function f(x) = sin 1/x (Figure 11). For this function it is false that f approaches 0 near 0. This amounts to saying that it is not true for every number e€ > O that we can get | f(x) — 0| < € by choosing x sufficiently small, and 4 0. ‘To show this we simply have to find one e¢ > O for which the condition | f(x) — O| < € cannot be guaranteed, no matter how small we require |x| to be.

    small we require |x| to be, we cannot ensure that | f(x) —_| < 7 The reason is,
    that for any interval A containing 0 we can find both x; and x2 in this interval
    with
    
    f(x) =1 and f(x2) =—-1,
    
    namely
    l l
    x=5 and x2 = 5
    5m + Qn 5 + 2mm
    
    for large enough n and m. But the interval from / — 5 to/ + 5 cannot contain
    both —1 and 1, since its total length is only |; so we cannot have
    
    || -I| <5 andalso |-1—1| < 5,
    
    no matter what / is.
    The phenomenon exhibited by f(x) = sin 1/x near 0 can occur in many ways.
    If we consider the function
    
    Q, x irrational
    1, x rational,
    
    f(x)=
    x irrational

    then, no matter what a is, f does not approach any number / near a. In fact, we
    
    cannot make | f(x) —/| < i no matter how close we bring x to a, because in any
    
    interval around a there are numbers x with f(x) = O, and also numbers x with
    f(x) = 1, so that we would need |O —/| < t and also |1 —/| < 7
    An amusing variation on this behavior is presented by the function shown in
    
    Figure 13:
    
    x, x rational
    
    roy= {4
    
    x irrational.
    
    The behavior of this function is "opposite" to that of g(x) = sin 1/x; it ap-
    proaches 0 at 0, but does not approach any number at a, if a # 0. By now you
    should have no difficulty convincing yourself that this is true.
    
    We conclude with a very simple example (Figure 14):
    
    —!1l, x<0O
    
    fO) = 1, x >0.

    If a > 0, then f approaches | near a: indeed, to ensure that | f(x) — I] < « it
    certainly suffices to require that |x — a| < a, since this implies
    
    —a<x-—a
    or O<x
    
    so that f(x) = Ll. Similarly, if b < 0, then f approaches —1 near b: to ensure
    that | f(x) — (—1)| < ¢ it suffices to require that |x — b| < —b. Finally, as you may
    easily check, f does not approach any number near 0.
    
    The time has now come to point out that of the many demonstrations about
    limits which we have given, not one has been a real proof. The fault hes not
    with our reasoning, but with our definition. If our provisional definition of a
    function was open to criticism, our provisional definition of approaching a limit
    is even more vulnerable. This definition is simply not sufficiently precise to be
    used in proofs. It is hardly clear how one "makes" f(x) close to / (whatever
    "close" means) by "requiring" x to be sufficiently close to a (however close "suff-
    ciently" close is supposed to be). Despite the criticisms of our definition you may
    feel (I certainly hope you do) that our arguments were nevertheless quite convinc-
    ing. In order to present any sort of argument at all, we have been practically forced
    to invent the real definition. It is possible to arrive at this definition in several steps,
    each one clarifying some obscure phrase which still remains. Let us begin, once
    again, with the provisional definition:
    
    The function f approaches the limit / near a, if we can make f(x) as close
    as we like to / by requiring that x be sufficiently close to, but unequal to, a.
    
    The very first change which we made in this definition was to note that making
    f(x) close to / meant making | f(x) —/| small, and similarly for x and a:
    
    98 Foundations
    
    DEFINITION
    
    The function f approaches the limit / near a, if we can make | f(x) —1| as
    small as we like by requiring that |x — a| be sufficiently small, and x # a.
  - |-
    The second, more crucial, change was to note that making | f(x) — | "as small as we like" means making | f(x) —1| < € for any ¢ > 0 that happens to be given us:
    
    The function f approaches the limit / near a, if for every number e€ > 0 we
    can make | f(x) —/| < e by requiring that |x — a| be sufficiently small, and
    
    xa.
    
    There is a common pattern to all the demonstrations about limits which we have
    given. For each number € > 0 we found some other positive number, 6 say, with
    the property that if x 4 a and |x —a| < 6, then | f(x) —1| < e. For the function
    f(x) = xsm1/x (with a = 0, 1 = O), the number 6 was just the number ¢;
    for f(x) = J |x| sin 1/x, it was e*; for f(x) = x? it was the minimum of | and
    €/(2\a| + 1). In general, it may not be at all clear how to find the number 4,
    given &€, but it is the condition |x — a| < 6 which expresses how small "sufficiently"
    small must be:
    
    The function f approaches the limit / near a, if for every € > O there is some
    6 > O such that, for all x, if |x —a| < 6 and x #a, then | f(x) -l| <e.
    
    This is practically the definition we will adopt. We will make only one trivial
    change, noting that "|x — a| < 6 and x # a" can just as well be expressed "O <
    Ix —a| <6."
    
    The function f approaches the limit / near a means: for every ¢ > O there
    is some 6 > O such that, for all x, if O < |x —a| < 4, then | f(x) —l| < e.
  - |-
    This definition is so important (everything we do from now on depends on it) that
    proceeding any further without knowing it is hopeless. If necessary memorize it,
    like a poem! That, at least, is better than stating it incorrectly; if you do this you
    are doomed to give incorrect proofs. A good exercise in giving correct proofs is to
    review every fact already demonstrated about functions approaching limits, giving
    formal proofs of each. In most cases, this will merely involve a bit of rewording
    to make the arguments conform to our formal definition—all the algebraic work
    has been done already. When proving that f does not approach / at a, be sure to
    negate the definition correctly:
    
    If it is not true that
    
    for every ε > 0 there is some δ > 0 such that, for all x, if 0 < |x —a| < δ,
    then | f(x) —L| < ε,
    
    then
    there is some ε > 0 such that for every δ > 0 there is some x which satisfies
    0 < |x —a| < δ but not |f(x) - L| < ε.
    
    Thus, to show that the function f(x) = sin(1/x) does not approach 0 near 0, we
    consider ε = 1/2 and note that for every δ > 0 there is some x with 0 < |x — 0| < δ
    but not |sin(1/x) - 0| < 1/2 —namely, an x of the form 1/(2nπ + 2nπ), where n is
    so large that 1/(2nπ + 2nπ) < δ.
    
    As a final illustration of the use of the definition of a function approaching a
    limit, we have reserved the function shown in Figure 15, a standard example, but
    one of the most complicated:
    
    f(x) = {
    0, x irrational, 0 < x < 1;
    1/q, x = p/q in lowest terms, 0 < x < 1.
    }
    
    (Recall that p/q is in lowest terms if p and q are integers with no common factor
    and q > 0.)

    these numbers. (If a happens to be one of these numbers, then consider only the  
    values |p/q —a| for p/q 4a.) This closest distance may be chosen as the 6. For

    description of the 6 which works for a given € is completely adequate—there is no  
    reason why we must give a formula for 6 in terms of €.  
    
    Armed with our definition, we are now prepared to prove our first theorem; you  
    have probably assumed the result all along, which is a very reasonable thing to do.  
    This theorem is really a test case for our definition: if the theorem could not be  
    proved, our definition would be useless.
  - |-
    A function cannot approach two different limits near a. In other words, if f approaches / near a, and f approaches m near a, then / = m.
    
    Since this is our first theorem about limits it will certainly be necessary to translate the hypotheses according to the definition.
    
    Since f approaches / near a, we know that for any ¢ > O there is some number 6, > 0 such that, for all x,
    
    if O < |x —a| < 6, then | f(x) —l| <e.
    
    We also know, since f approaches m near a, that there is some 52 > O such that,
    for all x,
    if O < |x —a| < 42, then | f(x) —m| <e.
    
    We have had to use two numbers, 6; and 42, since there is no guarantee that the 6
    which works in one definition will work in the other. But, in fact, it is now easy to
    conclude that for any ¢ > O there is some 6 > O such that, for all x,
    
    if O < |x —a| < 6, then | f(x) —l| < « and |f(x) —m| < ¢;
    
    we simply choose 6 = min(6, 62).
    To complete the proof we just have to pick a particular ¢ > O for which the two
    conditions
    
    If(x)-l<e and |f(x)-m|<e
    
    cannot both hold, if / # m. The proper choice is suggested by Figure 16. If
    1 £m, so that |l — m| > 0, we can choose |/ — m|/2 as our eé. It follows that there
    is a 6 > O such that, for all x,

    5. Limits 101
    
    The number / which f approaches near a is denoted by lim f(x) (read: the limit
    
    of f(x) as x approaches a). This definition is possible only because of Theorem 1,
    
    which ensures that lim f(x) never has to stand for two different numbers. The
    
    X—7a
    
    equation
    
    lim f(x) =1
    has exactly the same meaning as the phrase
    f approaches / near a.
    
    The possibility still remains that f does not approach / near a, for any /, so that
    lim f(x) =/ 1s false for every number /. This is usually expressed by saying that
    
    ‘lim f(x) does not exist."
    
    Xa
    
    Notice that our new notation introduces an extra, utterly irrelevant letter x,
    which could be replaced by ¢t, y, or any other letter which does not already
    appear—the symbols
    
    lim f(x), lim f(t), lim f(y),
    xa ta ya
    
    all denote precisely the same number, which depends on f and a, and has nothing
    to do with x, t, or y (these letters, in fact, do not denote anything at all). A more
    
    logical symbol would be something like lim f, but this notation, despite its brevity,
    
    is so infuriatingly rigid that almost no one has seriously tried to use it. ‘The notation
    lim f(x) 1s much more useful because a function f often has no simple name, even
    
    Xa
    
    though it might be possible to express f(x) by a simple formula involving x. ‘Thus,
    the short symbol
    lim (x? + sin x)
    
    Xa
    
    could be paraphrased only by the awkward expression
    
    lim f, where f(x) = x7 + sinx.
    
    Another advantage of the standard symbolism is ulustrated by the expressions
    
    lim x + r>.

    These examples illustrate the main advantage of our notation, which is its flexibility. In fact, the notation lim f(x) is so flexible that there is some danger of
    xa
    
    forgetting what it really means. Here is a simple exercise in the use of this no-
    tation, which will be important later: first interpret precisely, and then prove the
    equality of the expressions
    
    lim f(x) and lim f(a +h).
    
    An important part of this chapter is the proof of a theorem which will make
    it easy to find many limits, as we promised long ago. The proof depends upon
    certain properties of inequalities and absolute values, hardly surprising when one
    considers the definition of limit. Although these facts have already been stated in
    Problems 1-20, 1-21, and 1-22, because of their importance they will be presented
    once again, in the form of a lemma (a lemma is an auxiliary theorem, a result that
    justifies its existence only by virtue of its prominent role in the proof of another
    theorem). The lemma says, roughly, that if x is close to xo, and y is close to yo,
    then x + y will be close to xo + yo, and xy will be close to xoyo, and 1/y will be
    close to 1/yo. ‘This intuitive statement is much easier to remember than the precise
    estimates of the lemma, and it is not unreasonable to read the proof of Theorem 2
    first, in order to see just how these estimates are used.
    
    (1) If |x — xo| < 5 and |y — yo| < ε, then
    |x + y — (xo + yo)| < ε.
    (2) If |x — xo| < min(1, ε/(2(|yo| + 1))) and |y — yo| < ε/(2(|xo| + 1)),
    then
    |xy — xoyo| < ε.
    (3) If yo ≠ 0 and |y — yo| < min(ε/|yo|², 1), then y ≠ 0 and
    |1/y — 1/yo| < ε.

    Moreover, if m 4 O, then

    and if O < |x —a| < 42, then |g(x) —m| < «.
    
    This means (since, after all, ¢/2 1s also a positive number) that there are 6;, 62 > O

    If 0 < |x —a| <8), then |f(x) —I| < =

    Now let 6 = min(6;, 42). If O < |x —a| < 6, then O < |x —a| < 6, and
    O < |x —a| < 4) are both true, so both

    are true. But by part (1) of the lemma this implies that |(f + g)(x) —(/+m)| < e.
    This proves (1).
    
    To prove (2) we proceed similarly, after consulting part (2) of the lemma. If
    € > O there are 5), 59 > O such that, for all x,

    So, by the lemma, |(f - g)(x) —/-m| < ¢€, and this proves (2).
    Finally, if e¢ > 0 there 1s a 6 > O such that, for all x,
    
    2
    if O < |x —a| <6, then |g(x) —m| < in (1 — )
    
    But according to part (3) of the lemma this means, first, that g(x) 4 0, so (1/g)(x)

    Thus we can take
    
    6 = min  
    
    Naturally, these complicated expressions for 6 can be simplified considerably, after  
    they have been derived.
    
    One technical detail in the proof of Theorem 2 deserves some discussion. In  
    order for hm f (x) to be defined it 1s, as we know, not necessary for f to be defined  
    
    at a, nor is it necessary for f to be defined at all points x 4 a. However, there  
    must be some 6 > QO such that f(x) is defined for x satisfying 0 < |x —a| < 4;  
    otherwise the clause  
    
    "if O < |x —a| < 6, then | f(x) -—1| < &"  
    
    would make no sense at all, since the symbol f(x) would make no sense for  
    some x's. If f and g are two functions for which the definition makes sense, it is easy to see that the same is true for f + g and f-g. But this is not so  
    clear for 1/g, since 1/g is undefined for x with g(x) = 0. However, this fact gets  
    established in the proof of Theorem 2(3).

    There are trmes when we would like to speak of the limit which f approaches  
    at a, even though there 1s no 6 > O such that f(x) is defined for x satisfying  
    Q < |x —a| < 6. For example, we want to distinguish the behavior of the two  
    functions shown in Figure 17, even though they are not defined for numbers less  
    than a. kor the function of Figure 17(a) we write  
    
    lim f(x)=/ or im f(x) =1.  
    
    xat xia  
    
    (The symbols on the left are read: the limit of f(x) as x approaches a from above.)  
    These "limits from above" are obviously closely related to ordinary limits, and the
  - |-
    Definition 1 is very similar: lim, f(x) =/ means that for every ¢ > 0 there is a 6 > 0  
    Xa  
    
    such that, for all x,  
    if O<x—-—a <4, then | f(x) -—l1| < «.  
    
    (he condition "QO < x —a < 6" 1s equivalent to "O < |x —a| <6 and x > a.")
    
    "Limits from below" (Figure 18) are defined simuarly: lm f(x) = / (or  
    lim f(x) = 1) means that for every ¢€ > O there is a 6 > 0 such that, for  
    
    all x,  
    if O<a—x <6, then |f(x)—-—/| <€e.  
    
    It is quite possible to consider limits from above and below even if f is defined  
    for numbers both greater and less than a. ‘Thus, for the function f of Figure 14,  
    we have  
    
    lim f(x)=1 = and hm fx) =-l.  
    
    x— Ot  
    
    It is an easy exercise (Problem 29) to show that lim f(x) exists if and only if  
    
    lim f(x) and lm f(x) both exist and are equal.  
    
    Xa X2a7  
    
    Like the definitions of limits from above and below, which have been smuggled  
    into the text informally, there are other modifications of the limit concept which  
    will be found useful. In Chapter 4 it was claimed that if x is large, then sin |/x 1s  
    close to QO. ‘This assertion 1s usually written  
    
    lim sin 1/x = 0.  
    VO  
    
    The symbol lim f(x) is read "the limit of f(x) as x approaches 00," or "as x  
    
    becomes infinite," and a limit of the form lm f(x) 1s often called a limit at infinity.  
    A on ae, 2)  
    
    5. Limits 107  
    
    Figure 19 illustrates a general situation where lim f(x) =/. Formally, lim f(x) =  
    ! means that for every ¢ > O there is a number N such that, for all x,  
    if x > N, then | f(x) —1| <e.
  - |-
    The analogy with the definition of ordinary limits should be clear: whereas the  
    condition "OQ < |x — a| < 6" expresses the fact that x is close to a, the condition  
    "x > N" expresses the fact that x is large.  
    
    FIGURE 19  
    
    We have spent so little time on limits from above and below, and at infinity,  
    because the general philosophy behind the definitions should be clear if you un-  
    derstand the definition of ordinary limits (which are by far the most important).  
    Many exercises on these definitions are provided in the Problems, which also con-  
    tain several other types of limits which are occasionally useful.

    **Prove that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to a} |f(x) - f(a)| = 0$.** (This is mainly an exercise in understanding what the terms mean.)
    
    **(a)** Prove that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ if and only if $\lim_{x \to a} |f(x) - L| = 0$. (First see why the assertion is obvious; then provide a rigorous proof. In this chapter most problems which ask for proofs should be treated in the same way.)
    
    **(b)** Prove that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} f(x - a)$.
    
    **(c)** Prove that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} f(x)$.
    
    **(d)** Give an example where $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists, but $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ does not.
    
    Suppose there is an $\epsilon > 0$ such that $f(x) = g(x)$ when $0 < |x - a| < \epsilon$. Prove that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} g(x)$. In other words, $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ depends only on the values of $f(x)$ for $x$ near $a$—this fact is often expressed by saying that limits are a "local property." (It will clearly help to use $\epsilon'$, or some other letter, instead of $\epsilon$, in the definition of limits.)
    
    **(a)** Suppose that $f(x) < g(x)$ for all $x$. Prove that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) < \lim_{x \to a} g(x)$, provided that these limits exist.
    
    **(b)** How can the hypotheses be weakened?
    
    **(c)** If $f(x) < g(x)$ for all $x$, does it necessarily follow that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) < \lim_{x \to a} g(x)$?
    
    Suppose that $f(x) < g(x) < h(x)$ and that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} h(x)$. Prove that $\lim_{x \to a} g(x)$ exists, and that $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a} h(x)$. (Draw a picture!)

    Consider a function f with the following property: if g is any function for
    
    which lim g(x) does not exist, then lim [ f(x) + g(x)] also does not exist.
    
    Prove that this happens if and only if lim f(x) does exist. Hint: This is
    
    actually very easy: the assumption that lim f(x) does not exist leads to an
    
    immediate contradiction if you consider the right g.
    
    This problem is the analogue of Problem 22 when f + g is replaced by f - g.

    requires several steps (those in search of an especially challenging problem
    
    can attempt an independent solution).

    exist, then lim f (x)g(x) also does not exist.

    sort of limit is given in Problem 37.)

    After sending the manuscript for the first edition of this book off to the printer,  
    I thought of a much simpler way to prove that $ \lim_{x \to a} x^n = a^n $ and $ \lim_{x \to a} x^m = a^m $, without going through all the factoring tricks on page 92. Suppose, for  
    example, that we want to prove that $ \lim_{x \to a} x^n = a^n $, where $ a > 0 $. Given  
    $ \varepsilon > 0 $, we simply let $ \delta $ be the minimum of $ \sqrt[n]{a^n + \varepsilon} - a $ and $ a - \sqrt[n]{a^n - \varepsilon} $ (see Figure 19); then $ |x - a| < \delta $ implies that $ a^n - \varepsilon < x < \sqrt[n]{a^n + \varepsilon} $, so $ a^n - \varepsilon < x^n < a^n + \varepsilon $, or $ |x^n - a^n| < \varepsilon $. It is fortunate that these pages had  
    already been set, so that I couldn't make these changes, because this "proof" is completely fallacious. Wherein lies the fallacy?

    CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS
    
    If $ f $ is an arbitrary function, it is not necessarily true that  
    $ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a) $.
    
    In fact, there are many ways this can fail to be true. For example, $ f $ might not  
    even be defined at $ a $, in which case the equation makes no sense (Figure 1).
    
    Again, $ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) $ might not exist (Figure 2). Finally, as illustrated in Figure 3,
    
    even if $ f $ is defined at $ a $ and $ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) $ exists, the limit might not equal $ f(a) $.

    We would like to regard all behavior of this type as abnormal and honor, with
    some complimentary designation, functions which do not exhibit such peculiarities.
    The term which has been adopted is "continuous." Intuitively, a function f is
    continuous if the graph contains no breaks, jumps, or wild osculations. Although
    this description will usually enable you to decide whether a function is continuous
    simply by looking at its graph (a skill well worth cultivating) it is easy to be fooled,
    and the precise definition is very important.
    
    The function f is continuous at a if
    
    lim f(x) = f(a),
    
    We will have no difficulty finding many examples of functions which are, or are
    not, continuous at some number a—every example involving limits provides an
    example about continuity, and Chapter 5 certainly provides enough of these.
    
    The function f(x) = sin 1/x is not continuous at 0, because it is not even defined
    at 0, and the same is true of the function g(x) = x sin 1/x. On the other hand, if
    we are willing to extend the second of these functions, that is, if we wish to define

    x sin 1/x, x ≠ 0
    
    a, x = 0,
    
    G(x) = |
    
    then the choice of a = G(0) can be made in such a way that G will be continuous
    at 0—to do this we can (if fact, we must) define G(0) = 0 (Figure 4). This sort of
    extension is not possible for f; if we define
    
    sin 1/x, x ≠ 0
    
    a, x = 0,
    
    F(x) = |
    
    then F will not be continuous at 0, no matter what a is, because lim f(x) does
    
    x→0
    
    not exist.
    
    The function
    x, x rational
    
    f(x) = 0, x irrational
    
    is not continuous at a, if a ≠ 0, since lim f(x) does not exist. However, lim f(x) =
    x→a
    
    x→0 = f(0), so f is continuous at precisely one point, 0.

    The functions f(x) = c, g(x) = x, and h(x) = x² are continuous at all numbers a, since
    
    lim f(x) = lim c = c = f(a),
    
    lim g(x) = lim x = a = g(a),
    
    lim h(x) = lim x² = a² = h(a).
    
    Finally, consider the function
    
    $$
    f(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if } x \text{ is irrational} \\
    1/q & \text{if } x = p/q \text{ in lowest terms.}
    \end{cases}
    $$
    
    In Chapter 5 we showed that lim f(x) = 0 for all a (actually, only for 0 <a < 1,
    
    but you can easily see that this is true for all a). Since 0 = f(a) only when a is irrational, this function is continuous at a if a is irrational, but not if a is rational.
    
    It is even easier to give examples of continuity if we prove two simple theorems.
    
    If f and g are continuous at a, then
    
    (1) f + g is continuous at a,
    (2) f + g is continuous at a.
    
    Moreover, if g(a) ≠ 0, then
    
    (3) 1/g is continuous at a.

    THEOREM 2
    
    PROOF
    
    6. Continuous Functions 117
    
    Since f and g are continuous at a,
    
    lim f(x) = f(a) and lim g(x) = g(a).
    By Theorem 2(1) of Chapter 5 this implies that
    
    lim(f + g)(x) = f(a) + g(a) = (f + g)(a),
    
    which is just the assertion that f + g is continuous at a. The proofs of parts (2)
    and (3) are left to you. J
    
    Starting with the functions f(x) = c and f(x) = x, which are continuous at a,
    for every a, we can use Theorem 1 to conclude that a function
    
    $$
    f(x) = b_0x^n + b_1x^{n-1} + \cdots + b_n
    $$
    
    $$
    g(x) = c_0x^m + c_1x^{m-1} + \cdots + c_m
    $$
    
    is continuous at every point in its domain. But it is harder to get much further
    
    than that. When we discuss the sine function in detail it will be easy to prove that
    sin is continuous at a for all a; let us assume this fact meanwhile. A function like
    
    $$
    f(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if } x \text{ is irrational} \\
    1/q & \text{if } x = p/q \text{ in lowest terms.}

    can now be proved continuous at every point in its domain. But we are still  
    unable to prove the continuity of a function like f(x) = sin(x*); we obviously  
    need a theorem about the composition of continuous functions. Before stating this  
    theorem, the following point about the definition of continuity is worth noting. If  
    we translate the equation lim f(x) = f(a) according to the definition of limits,  
    
    we obtain  
    
    for every € > O there is 6 > O such that, for all x,  
    
    if O < |x —a| <4, then | f(x) — f(a)| < «.  
    But in this case, where the limit is f(a), the phrase  
    0 < |x -—a|l <6  
    may be changed to the simpler condition  
    Ix —a| <4,  
    
    since if x =a it 1s certainly true that | f(x) — f(a)| <e.  
    
    If g is continuous at a, and f 1s continuous at g(a), then f og is continuous at a.  
    (Notice that f 1s required to be continuous at g(a), not at a.)  
    
    Let ¢ > 0. We wish to find a 6 > O such that for all x,  
    
    if |x —a| <6, then |(f og)(x) — (fo g)(a)| < €,  
    le., |f(g(x)) — f(g(a))| < «.
  - |-
    We now use continuity of g to estimate how close x must be to a in order for the
    inequality |g(x) — g(a)| < 6' to hold. The number 6' is a positive number just like
    any other positive number; we can therefore take 6' as the ε in the definition of
    continuity of g at a. We conclude that there is a 6 > O such that, for all x,
    
    (3) if |x —a| < 6, then |g(x) — g(a)| < 8.
    Combining (2) and (3) we see that for all x,
    if |x —a| < 4, then | f(g(x)) — f(g(a))| < ε. 1
    
    We can now reconsider the function
    
    —Jxsmi/x, x #0
    roy =} 5, x=0.
    
    We have already noted that f is continuous at 0. A few applications of Theorems
    and 2, together with the continuity of sin, show that f is also continuous at a, for
    a #0. Functions like f(x) = sin(x? + sin(x + sin*(x3))) should be equally easy
    for you to analyze.
    
    The few theorems of this chapter have all been related to continuity of functions
    at a single point, but the concept of continuity doesn't begin to be really interesting
    until we focus our attention on functions which are continuous at all points of some
    interval. If f is continuous at x for all x in (a,b), then f is called continuous
    on (a,b); as a "special case", f is continuous on R = (—∞, ∞) [see page 57] if
    it is continuous at x for all x in R. Continuity on a closed interval must be defined
    a little differently; a function f is called continuous on [a, b] if
    
    (1) f is continuous at x for all x in (a, D),
    
    (2) lim f(x) = f(a) and lim f(x) = f(b).
    
    x→a+
    
    (We also often simply say that a function is continuous if it is continuous at x for
    all x in its domain.)

    Functions which are continuous on an interval are usually regarded as especially
    well behaved; indeed continuity might be specified as the first condition which a
    "reasonable" function ought to satisfy. A continuous function is sometimes de-
    scribed, intuitively, as one whose graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil
    from the paper. Consideration of the function

    PROOF
    
    FIGURE 5
    
    6. Continuous Functions 119
    
    shows that this description is a little too optimistic, but it is nevertheless true that
    there are many important results involving functions which are continuous on an
    interval. There theorems are generally much harder than the ones in this chapter,
    but there is a simple theorem which forms a bridge between the two kinds of results.
    The hypothesis of this theorem requires continuity at only a single point, but the
    conclusion describes the behavior of the function on some interval containing the
    point. Although this theorem is really a lemma for later arguments, it is included
    here as a preview of things to come.
    
    Suppose f is continuous at a, and f(a) > 0. Then f(x) > O for all x in some
    interval containing a; more precisely, there is a number 6 > O such that f(x) > O
    for all x satisfying |x —a| < 6. Similarly, if f(a) < 0, then there is a number 6 > 0
    such that f(x) < 0 for all x satisfying |x —a| < 6.
    
    Consider the case f(a) > 0. Since f is continuous at a, for every ε > O there is a
    6 > O such that, for all x,
    
    if |x —a| < 6, then | f(x) — f(a)| < ε,
    le., -ε < f(x) — f(a) < ε.
    
    In particular, this must hold for ε = f(a), since f(a) > O (Figure 5). Thus
    there is 6 > O so that for all x,

    if |x —a| < 6, then —5 f(a) < f(x) — f(a) < 3 f(a),
    
    and this implies that f(x) > 5 f (a) > Q. (We could even have picked € to be f(a)
    itself, leading to a proof that is more elegant, but more confusing to picture.)
    
    A similar proof can be given in the case f(a) < 0; take ¢ = —5f (a). Or one
    can apply the first case to the function —f. J

(It is worth thinking about this problem now, but mainly as a test of intuition; even if you suspect the correct answer, you will almost certainly be unable to prove it at the present time. See Problem 22-33.)

    THREE HARD THEOREMS
    
    This chapter is devoted to three theorems about continuous functions, and some of their consequences. The proofs of the three theorems themselves will not be given until the next chapter, for reasons which are explained at the end of this chapter.
    
    If f is continuous on [a,b] and f(a) < 0 < f(b), then there is some x in [a, b] such that f(x) = 0.
    
    (Geometrically, this means that the graph of a continuous function which starts below the horizontal axis and ends above it must cross this axis at some point, as in Figure 1.)

    If f is continuous on [a, b], then f is bounded above on [a, b], that is, there is
    some number M such that f(x) ≤ M for all x in [a, b].
    
    (Geometrically, this theorem means that the graph of f lies below some line par-
    allel to the horizontal axis, as in Figure 2.)
    
    If f is continuous on [a,b], then there is some number y in [a,b] such that
    
    f(y) = f(x) for all x in [a, b] (Figure 3).
    
    These three theorems differ markedly from the theorems of Chapter 6. The
    hypotheses of those theorems always involved continuity at a single point, while

    THEOREM 4
    
    7. Three Hard Theorems 123
    
    the hypotheses of the present theorems require continuity on a whole interval
    (a, b).—if continuity fails to hold at a single point, the conclusions may fail. For
    example, let f be the function shown in Figure 4,
    
    —], 0 < x < √2
    
    f(x) =
    1, √2 < x < 2.
    
    Then f is continuous at every point of [0,2] except √2, and f(0) < 0 < f(2),
    
    but there is no point x in [0, 2] such that f(x) = 0; the discontinuity at the single
    
    point √2 is sufficient to destroy the conclusion of Theorem 1.
    
    Similarly, suppose that f is the function shown in Figure 5,
    
    _ | 1/√x, x ≠ 0
    f(x) = |
    | 0, x = 0.
    
    Then f is continuous at every point of [0, 1] except 0, but f is not bounded above
    on [0, 1]. In fact, for any number N > 0 we have f(1/(2N)) = 2N > N.
    
    This example also shows that the closed interval [a, b] in Theorem 2 cannot be
    replaced by the open interval (a, b), for the function f is continuous on (0, 1), but
    is not bounded there.

    Finally, consider the function shown in Figure 6,
    
    2
    
    4p xe, x<l
    foy=]e x >I.
    
    On the interval [0,1] the function f is bounded above, so f does satisfy the
    conclusion of 'Theorem 2, even though f is not continuous on [0,1]. But f
    does not satisfy the conclusion of Theorem 3—there is no y in [O, 1] such that
    f(y) = f(x) for all x in [0, 1]; in fact, it is certainly not true that f(1) > f(x) for
    all x in [0, 1] so we cannot choose y = 1, nor can we choose 0 < y < I because
    f(y) < f(x) if x is any number with y < x < I.
    
    This example shows that Theorem 3 is considerably stronger than Theorem 2.
    Theorem 3 is often paraphrased by saying that a continuous function on a closed
    interval "takes on its maximum value" on that interval.
    
    As a compensation for the stringency of the hypotheses of our three theorems,
    the conclusions are of a totally different order than those of previous theorems.
    They describe the behavior of a function, not just near a point, but on a whole in-
    terval; such "global" properties of a function are always significantly more difficult
    to prove than "local" properties, and are correspondingly of much greater power.
    To illustrate the usefulness of Theorems 1, 2, and 3, we will soon deduce some im-
    portant consequences, but it will help to first mention some simple generalizations
    of these theorems.
    
    If f is continuous on [a,b] and f(a) < c < f(b), then there is some x in [a. )]
    such that f(x) =.
  - |-
    Let $ g = f - c $. Then $ g $ is continuous, and $ g(a) < 0 < g(b) $. By Theorem 1, there is some $ x $ in $[a,b]$ such that $ g(x) = 0 $. But this means that $ f(x) = c $.
    
    If $ f $ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $ f(a) > c > f(b) $, then there is some $ x $ in $[a, b]$ such that $ f(x) = c $.
    
    The function $ -f $ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $ -f(a) < -c < -f(b) $. By Theorem 4 there is some $ x $ in $[a,b]$ such that $ -f(x) = -c $, which means that $ f(x) = c $.
    
    Theorems 4 and 5 together show that $ f $ takes on any value between $ f(a) $ and $ f(b) $. We can do even better than this: if $ c $ and $ d $ are in $[a,b]$, then $ f $ takes on any value between $ f(c) $ and $ f(d) $. The proof is simple: if, for example, $ c < d $, then just apply Theorems 4 and 5 to the interval $[c,d]$. Summarizing, if a continuous function on an interval takes on two values, it takes on every value in between; this slight generalization of Theorem 1 is often called the Intermediate Value Theorem.
    
    If $ f $ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then $ f $ is bounded below on $[a, b]$, that is, there is some number $ N $ such that $ f(x) > N $ for all $ x $ in $[a, b]$.
    
    The function $ -f $ is continuous on $[a, b]$, so by Theorem 2 there is a number $ M $ such that $ -f(x) < M $ for all $ x $ in $[a,b]$. But this means that $ f(x) > -M $ for all $ x $ in $[a,b]$, so we can let $ N = -M $.
  - |-
    Theorems 2 and 6 together show that a continuous function f on [a, b] is
    bounded on [a, b], that is, there is a number N such that | f(x)| < N for all x in
    [a,b]. In fact, since Theorem 2 ensures the existence of a number N such that
    f(x) < N, for all x in [a,b], and Theorem 6 ensures the existence of a number
    N> such that f(x) > N> for all x in [a, b], we can take N = max(|N1|, |N2)).
    
    If f is continuous on [a, b], then there is some y in [a,b] such that f(y) < f(x)
    for all x in [a, Db}.
    
    (A continuous function on a closed interval takes on its minimum value on that
    interval.)
    
    The function —f is continuous on [a, b]; by Theorem 3 there is some y in [a, dD]
    such that — f(y) > —f(x) for all x in [a,b], which means that f(y) < f(x) for
    all x in [a, b]. fj
    
    Now that we have derived the trivial consequences of Theorems 1, 2, and 3, we
    can begin proving a few interesting things.
    
    Every positive number has a square root. In other words, if @ > O, then there is
    some number x such that x* = a.
    
    PROOF
    
    FIGURE 7
    
    THEOREM 9
    
    PROOF
    
    7. Three Hard Theorems 125
    
    Consider the function f(x) = x*, which is certainly continuous. Notice that the
    statement of the theorem can be expressed in terms of f: "the number @ has a
    square root" means that f takes on the value a. The proof of this fact about f
    will be an easy consequence of Theorem 4.
  - |-
    There is obviously a number b > O such that f(b) > a (as illustrated in Figure 7);
    in fact, if a > 1 we can take b = a, while if a < 1 we can take b = 1. Since
    f() <a < f(b), Theorem 4 applied to [0, b] implies that for some x (in [0, d]),
    
    we have f(x) =a, ie, x*=a.§
    
    Precisely the same argument can be used to prove that a positive number has
    an nth root, for any natural number n. If n happens to be odd, one can do
    better: every number has an nth root. ‘To prove this we just note that if the positive
    number a has the nth root x, 1.e., if x" =a, then (—x)" = —a (since n 1s odd), so
    —a has the nth root —x. The assertion, that for odd n any number a@ has an nth
    root, is equivalent to the statement that the equation
    
    x"-—-a=0
    
    has a root if n is odd. Expressed in this way the result is susceptible of great
    generalization.
    
    If n is odd, then any equation
    
    ]
    
    x" +a,_\x" ~+---+ay9 =0
    
    has a root.
    
    We obviously want to consider the function
    f (x) = x" + yx"! + +++ +49;
    
    we would like to prove that f is sometimes positive and sometimes negative. The
    intuitive idea is that for large |x|, the function is very much like g(x) = x" and,
    since n is odd, this function is positive for large positive x and negative for large
    negative x. A little algebra is all we need to make this intuitive idea work.
    
    The proper analysis of the function f depends on writing

    Consequently, if we choose x satisfying

    Now applying Theorem | to the interval $[x2, x;]$ we conclude that there is an $x$  
    in $[x2, x;]$ such that $f(x) =0$. J  
    
    Theorem 9 disposes of the problem of odd degree equations so happily that it  
    would be frustrating to leave the problem of even degree equations completely  
    undiscussed. At first sight, however, the problem seems insuperable. Some equa-  
    tions, like $x^* — 1 = 0$, have a solution, and some, like $x^* + 1 = 0$, do not—what  
    more is there to say? If we are willing to consider a more general question, how-  
    ever, something interesting can be said. Instead of trying to solve the equation  
    
    $$
    x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_0 = 0
    $$  
    let us ask about the possibility of solving the equations  
    $$
    x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_0 = c
    $$

    for all possible numbers c. This amounts to allowing the constant term a0 to vary.
    The information which can be given concerning the solution of these equations
    depends on a fact which is illustrated in Figure 8.
    
    The graph of the function f(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0, with n even, contains,
    at least the way we have drawn it, a lowest point. In other words, there is a
    number y such that f(y) < f(x) for all numbers x—the function f takes on a
    minimum value, not just on each closed interval, but on the whole line. (Notice
    that this is false if n is odd.) The proof depends on Theorem 7, but a tricky
    application will be required. We can apply Theorem 7 to any interval [a, b], and
    obtain a point y0 such that f(y0) is the minimum value of f on [a, b]; but if [a, b]
    happens to be the interval shown in Figure 8, for example, then the point y0 will
    not be the place where f has its minimum value for the whole line. In the next

    and suppose n is even. Then there is a number m such that (*) has a solution for
    c > m and has no solution for c < m.
    
    Let f(x) =x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0 (Figure 10).
  - |-
    According to ‘Theorem 10 there is a number y such that f(y) < f(x) for all x.
    Let m = f(y). If c < m, then the equation (*) obviously has no solution, since
    the left side always has a value > m. If c = m, then (*) has y as a solution.
    Finally, suppose c > m. Let b be a number such that b > y and f(b) > c. Then
    f(y) =m <c < f(b). Consequently, by Theorem 4, there is some number x in
    [y, b] such that f(x) =c, so x is a solution of (*). J
    
    These consequences of Theorems 1, 2, and 3 are the only ones we will derive
    now (these theorems will play a fundamental role in everything we do later, how-
    ever). Only one task remains—to prove Theorems 1, 2, and 3. Unfortunately,
    we cannot hope to do this—on the basis of our present knowledge about the real
    numbers (namely, P1–P12) a proof is impossible. There are several ways of con-
    vincing ourselves that this gloomy conclusion is actually the case. For example,
    the proof of Theorem 8 relies only on the proof of Theorem 1; if we could prove
    Theorem 1, then the proof of Theorem 8 would be complete, and we would have
    a proof that every positive number has a square root. As pointed out in Part I, it
    is impossible to prove this on the basis of P1–P12. Again, suppose we consider the
    function
    
    f(x) =
    
    {
    x² - 2
    if x ≠ √2,
    0
    if x = √2.
    
    If there were no number x with x² = 2, then f would be continuous, since the
    denominator would never = 0. But f is not bounded on [0, 2]. So Theorem 2
    depends essentially on the existence of numbers other than rational numbers, and
    therefore on some property of the real numbers other than P1–P12.
  - |-
    Despite our inability to prove Theorems 1, 2, and 3, they are certainly results
    which we want to be true. If the pictures we have been drawing have any con-
    nection with the mathematics we are doing, if our notion of continuous function
    corresponds to any degree with our intuitive notion, Theorems 1, 2, and 3 have
    got to be true. Since a proof of any of these theorems must require some new
    property of R which has so far been overlooked, our present difficulties suggest a
    way to discover that property: let us try to construct a proof of Theorem 1, for
    example, and see what goes wrong.
    
    One idea which seems promising is to locate the first point where f(x) = 0, that
    is, the smallest x in [a,b] such that f(x) = 0. To find this point, first consider
    the set A which contains all numbers x in [a,b] such that f is negative on [a, x].
    In Figure 11, x is such a point, while x' is not. The set A itself is indicated by a
    heavy line. Since f is negative at a, and positive at b, the set A contains some
    points greater than a, while all points sufficiently close to b are not in A. (We are
    here using the continuity of f on [a,b], as well as Problem 6-16.)

    As in the proof of Theorem 9, if
    M = max(1, 2n|a_{n-1}|,..., 2n|a_0|),
    
    then for all x with |x| > M, we have

    provided that |x| => M. Now consider the number f(0). Let b > QO be a number such that b" > 2 (QO) and also b > M. Then, if x > b, we have (Figure 9)
    
    Summarizing:
    
    if x > b or x < —b, then f(x) > f(Q).
    
    Now apply Theorem 7 to the function f on the interval [—b, b]. We conclude that there is a number y such that
    
    (1) if -b < x < b, then f(y) < f(x).
    In particular, f(y) < f(0). Thus
    (2) if x < —b or x > b, then f(x) > f(0) > f(y).
    Combining (1) and (2) we see that f(y) < f(x) for all x. §
    
    Theorem 10 now allows us to prove the following result.
    
    Consider the equation
    
    (et) x" + a,_yx"| + --- + a9 = c,
    f(x) < 0 for all x in this interval

    7. Three Hard Theorems 129
    
    Now suppose @ is the smallest number which is greater than all members of A;
    clearly a < a < b. We claim that f(a@) = 0, and to prove this we only have to
    eliminate the possibilities f(a) < 0 and f(a) > 0.
    
    Suppose first that f(a) < 0. Then, by Theorem 6-3, f(x) would be less than 0
    for all x in a small interval containing aq, in particular for some numbers bigger
    than @ (Figure 12); but this contradicts the fact that @ is bigger than every member
    of A, since the larger numbers would also be in A. Consequently, f(a) < 0 is
    false.
  - |-
    On the other hand, suppose f(a) > 0. Again applying Theorem 6-3, we see that
    f(x) would be positive for all x in a small interval containing @, in particular for
    some numbers smaller than a (Figure 13). This means that these smaller numbers
    are all not in A. Consequently, one could have chosen an even smaller a which
    would be greater than all members of A. Once again we have a contradiction;
    f(a) > 0 is also false. Hence f(a) = O and, we are tempted to say, Q.E.D.
    
    We know, however, that something must be wrong, since no new properties of R
    were ever used, and it does not require much scrutiny to find the dubious point.
    It is clear that we can choose a number a which is greater than all members of A
    (for example, we can choose a = b), but it is not so clear that we can choose a
    smallest one. In fact, suppose A consists of all numbers x > 0 such that x* < 2.
    If the number V2 did not exist, there would not be a least number greater than
    all the members of A; for any y > /2 we chose, we could always choose a still
    smaller one.
    
    Now that we have discovered the fallacy, it is almost obvious what additional
    property of the real numbers we need. All we must do is say it properly and use it.
    That is the business of the next chapter.

    **DEFINITION**
    
    **DEFINITION**
    
    **LEAST UPPER BOUNDS**
    
    This chapter reveals the most important property of the real numbers. Nevertheless, it is merely a sequel to Chapter 7; the path which must be followed has already been indicated, and further discussion would be useless delay.
    
    A set $ A $ of real numbers is bounded above if there is a number $ x $ such that $ x > a $ for every $ a \in A $.
    
    Such a number $ x $ is called an upper bound for $ A $.
    
    Obviously $ A $ is bounded above if and only if there is a number $ x $ which is an upper bound for $ A $ (and in this case there will be lots of upper bounds for $ A $); we often say, as a concession to idiomatic English, that "$ A $ has an upper bound" when we mean that there is a number which is an upper bound for $ A $.
    
    Notice that the term "bounded above" has now been used in two ways—first, in Chapter 7, in reference to functions, and now in reference to sets. This dual usage should cause no confusion, since it will always be clear whether we are talking about a set of numbers or a function. Moreover, the two definitions are closely connected: if $ A $ is the set $ \{f(x) : a < x < b\} $, then the function $ f $ is bounded above on $ [a, b] $ if and only if the set $ A $ is bounded above.
    
    The entire collection $ \mathbb{R} $ of real numbers, and the natural numbers $ \mathbb{N} $, are both examples of sets which are not bounded above. An example of a set which is bounded above is
    
    $$ A = \{x : 0 < x < 1\} $$
  - |-
    To show that A is bounded above we need only name some upper bound for A,
    which is easy enough; for example, 138 is an upper bound for A, and so are 2,
    15, li, and 1. Clearly, 1 is the least upper bound of A; although the phrase
    just introduced is self-explanatory, in order to avoid any possible confusion (in
    particular, to ensure that we all know what the superlative of "less" means), we
    define this explicitly.
    
    A number x is a least upper bound of A if
    
    (1) x is an upper bound of A,
    and (2) if y is an upper bound of A, then x < y.
    
    133
    
    134 Foundations
    
    The use of the indefinite article "a" in this definition was merely a concession
    to temporary ignorance. Now that we have made a precise definition, it is easily
    seen that if x and y are both least upper bounds of A, then x = y. Indeed, in this
    case
    
    x < y, since y is an upper bound, and x is a least upper bound,
    
    and y < x, since x is an upper bound, and y is a least upper bound;
    
    it follows that x = y. For this reason we speak of the least upper bound of A.
    The term supremum of A is synonymous and has one advantage. It abbreviates
    quite nicely to
    
    sup A (pronounced "soup A")
    
    and saves us from the abbreviation
    
    lub A
    
    (which is nevertheless used by some authors).
    
    There is a series of important definitions, analogous to those just given, which
    can now be treated more briefly. A set A of real numbers is bounded below if
    there is a number x such that
    
    x < a for every a in A.
    
    Such a number x is called a lower bound for A. A number x is the greatest
    lower bound of A if
    
    (1) x is a lower bound of A,
    and (2) if y is a lower bound of A, then x > y.
    
    The greatest lower bound of A is also called the infimum of A, abbreviated
    inf A;
    some authors use the abbreviation
    glb A.
  - |-
    One detail has been omitted from our discussion so far—the question of which  
    sets have at least one, and hence exactly one, least upper bound or greatest lower  
    bound. We will consider only least upper bounds, since the question for greatest  
    lower bounds can then be answered easily (Problem 2).
    
    If A is not bounded above, then A has no upper bound at all, so A certainly  
    cannot be expected to have a least upper bound. It is tempting to say that A does  
    have a least upper bound if it has some upper bound, but, like the principle of  
    mathematical induction, this assertion can fail to be true in a rather special way.  
    If A = ∅, then A is bounded above. Indeed, any number x is an upper bound  
    for ∅:
    
    x > y for every y in ∅
    
    simply because there is no y in ∅. Since every number is an upper bound for ∅,  
    there is surely no least upper bound for ∅. With this trivial exception however,

    our assertion is true—and very important, definitely important enough to warrant  
    consideration of details. We are finally ready to state the last property of the real  
    numbers which we need.
    
    (P13) | (The least upper bound property) If A is a set of real numbers,  
    A ≠ ∅, and A is bounded above, then A has a least upper bound.
  - |-
    Property P13 may strike you as anticlimactic, but that is actually one of its
    virtues. [o complete our list of basic properties for the real numbers we require no
    particularly abstruse proposition, but only a property so simple that we might feel
    foolish for having overlooked it. Of course, the least upper bound property is not
    really so innocent as all that; after all, it does not hold for the rational numbers Q.
    For example, if A is the set of all rational numbers x satisfying x" < 2, then there
    is no rational number y which is an upper bound for A and which 1s less than or
    equal to every other rational number which is an upper bound for A. It will become
    clear only gradually how significant P13 is, but we are already in a position to
    demonstrate its power, by supplying the proofs which were omitted in Chapter 7.
    
    If f is continuous on [a,b] and f(a) < O < f(b), then there is some number x
    in [a, b] such that f(x) = 0
    
    Our proof is merely a rigorous version of the outline developed at the end of
    Chapter 7—we will locate the smallest number x in [a, b] with f(x) = O
    Define the set A, shown in Figure 1, as follows:
    
    = { x -a <x <b, and f 1s negative on the interval [a, x]}.
    
    Clearly A 4 Y, since a 1s in A; in fact, there is some 6 > O such that A contains
    all points x satisfying a < x < a+; this follows from Problem 6-16, since f is
    continuous on [a,b] and f(a) < 0. Similarly, b is an upper bound for A and, in
    fact, there is a 5 > O such that all points x satisfying b— 6 < x < b are upper
    bounds for A; this also follows from Problem 6-16, since f(b) > 0.
    
    From these remarks it follows that A has a least upper bound q@ and that
    a <a < b. We now wish to show that f(a) = 0, by eliminating the possibil-
    ities f(a) < Oand f(a) > 0.

    Suppose first that f(a) < 0. By Theorem 6-3, there is a δ > 0 such that
    f(x) < 0 for a − δ < x < a + δ (Figure 2). Now there is some number x₀ in A
    which satisfies a − δ < x₀ < a + δ (because otherwise a + δ would not be the least upper
    bound of A). This means that f is negative on the whole interval [a, x₀]. But if
    x₀ is a number between a and a + δ, then f is also negative on the whole interval
    [x₀, x₁]. Therefore f is negative on the interval [a, x], so x₀ is in A. But this
    contradicts the fact that a is an upper bound for A; our original assumption that
    f(a) < 0 must be false.
    
    Suppose, on the other hand, that f(a) > 0. Then there is a number δ > 0 such
    that f(x) > 0 for a − δ < x < a + δ (Figure 3). Once again we know that there is
    an x₀ in A satisfying a − δ < x₀ < a + δ; but this means that f is negative on [a, x₀].
    This is impossible, since f(x₀) > 0. Thus the assumption f(a) > 0 also leads to
    a contradiction, leaving f(a) = 0 as the only possible alternative. ✅
    
    The proofs of Theorems 2 and 3 of Chapter 7 require a simple preliminary
    result, which will play much the same role as "Theorem 6-3 played in the previous
    proof.
    
    If f is continuous at a, then there is a number δ > 0 such that f is bounded
    above on the interval (a − δ, a + δ) (see Figure 4).
    
    Since lim f(x) = f(a), there is, for every ε > 0, a δ > 0 such that, for all x,
    
    if |x − a| < δ, then |f(x) − f(a)| < ε.
  - |-
    It is only necessary to apply this statement to some particular € (any one will do),
    for example, ¢ = 1. We conclude that there is a 6 > O such that, for all x,
    
    if jx —a| <6, then | f(x) — f(a)| < 1.
    
    It follows, in particular, that if |x —a| < 6, then f(x) — f(a) < 1. This completes
    the proof: on the interval (a — 6,a + 5) the function f is bounded above by
    f(a)+1.J
    
    It should hardly be necessary to add that we can now also prove that f is
    bounded below on some interval (a — 6,a + 4), and, finally, that f is bounded on
    some open interval containing a.
    
    A more significant point is the observation that if lim f(x) = f(a), then there

    is a 6 > O such that f is bounded on the set {x : a < x < a+}, and a similar
    observation holds if lim f(x) = f(b). Having made these observations (and
    
    X— D~
    
    assuming that you will supply the proofs), we tackle our second major theorem.
    If f is continuous on [a, b], then f is bounded above on [a, b].
    
    Let
    A= {x :a <x <band f is bounded above on [a, x]}.
    
    Clearly A 4 (since a is in A), and A is bounded above (by b), so A has a least
    upper bound @. Notice that we are here applying the term "bounded above" both
    to the set A, which can be visualized as lying on the horizontal axis, and to f, Le.,
    to the sets { f(y) : a < y < x}, which can be visualized as lying on the vertical axis
    (Figure 5).
  - |-
    Our first step is to prove that we actually have a = b. Suppose, instead, that
    a <b. By Theorem | there 1s 6 > O such that f is bounded on (w—6,a@+6). Since
    a is the least upper bound of A there is some xo in A satisfying a—5 < x9 <a. This
    means that f 1s bounded on [a, xo]. But if x; 1s any number witha < x1 <a+6,
    then f is also bounded on [xo, x1]. Therefore f 1s bounded on [a, x1], so x1 is
    in A, contradicting the fact that a is an upper bound for A. This contradiction
    shows that a = b. One detail should be mentioned: this demonstration implicitly
    assumed that a < @ [so that f would be defined on some interval (@ — 6,a@ + 4)];
    the possibility a = @ can be ruled out similarly, using the existence of a 6 > 0 such
    that f is bounded on {x :a <x <a+t+6}.
    
    The proof is not quite complete—we only know that f is bounded on [a, x] for
    every x < b, not necessarily that f is bounded on [a, b]. However, only one small
    argument needs to be added.
    
    There is a 6 > O such that f is bounded on {x : b—6 < x < b}. There is xg
    in A such that b — 5 < xg < b. Thus f is bounded on |[a, xo] and also on [xo, 5],
    so f is bounded on [a,b]. J
    
    ‘To prove the third important theorem we resort to a trick.
    
    If f is continuous on [a, b], then there is a number y in [a, b] such that f(y) >
    
    f(x) for all x in [a, b].
    
    We already know that f is bounded on [a, b], which means that the set

    Is continuous on [a, b], since the denominator of the right side is never 0. On the
    other hand, α is the least upper bound of { f(x) : x in [a, b]}; this means that
    
    for every ε > 0 there is x in [a, b] with α — f(x) < ε.
    This, in turn, means that
    for every ε > 0 there is x in [a, b] with g(x) > 1/ε.
    
    But this means that g is not bounded on [a, b], contradicting the previous theorem. QED
    
    At the beginning of this chapter the set of natural numbers N was given as an
    example of an unbounded set. We are now going to prove that N is unbounded.
    After the difficult theorems proved in this chapter you may be startled to find
    such an "obvious" theorem winding up our proceedings. If so, you are, perhaps,
    allowing the geometrical picture of R to influence you too strongly. "Look," you
    may say, "the real numbers look like

    So every number x is between two integers n, n + | (unless x is itself an integer)
    Basing the argument on a geometric picture is not a proof, however, and even the
    geometric picture contains an assumption: that if you place unit segments end-to-
    end you will eventually get a segment larger than any given segment. This axiom,
    often omitted from a first introduction to geometry, is usually attributed (not quite
    justly) to Archimedes, and the corresponding property for numbers, that N is not
    bounded, is called the Archimedean property of the real numbers. 'This property is not
    a consequence of PI—P12 (see reference [14] of the Suggested Reading), although
    it does hold for Q, of course. Once we have P13 however, there are no longer
    any problems.
    
    N is not bounded above.
    
    Suppose N were bounded above. Since N ⊆ ℝ, there would be a least upper
    bound α for N. Then
    
    α > n for all n ∈ N.
    
    Consequently,
    
    α > n + 1 for all n ∈ N,
    since n + 1 is in N if 1 is in N. But this means that
    α − 1 > n for all n ∈ N,
    
    and this means that α − 1 is also an upper bound for N, contradicting the fact that
    α is the least upper bound. J

    8. Least Upper Bounds 139
    
    There is a consequence of Theorem 2 (actually an equivalent formulation) which
    we have very often assumed implicitly.
    
    For any ε > 0 there is a natural number n with |1/n| < ε.
    
    Suppose not; then |1/n| > ε for all n in N. Thus 1/ε < n for all n in N. But this
    means that 1/ε is an upper bound for N, contradicting Theorem 2. J

    A brief glance through Chapter 6 will show you that the result of Theorem 3  
    was used in the discussion of many examples. Of course, Theorem 3 was not  
    available at the time, but the examples were so important that in order to give  
    them some cheating was tolerated. As partial justification for this dishonesty we  
    can claim that this result was never used in the proof of a theorem, but if your faith  
    has been shaken, a review of all the proofs given so far is in order. Fortunately,  
    such deception will not be necessary again. We have now stated every property of  
    the real numbers that we will ever need. Henceforth, no more lies.

    Prove that if f is continuous and f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x and y, then there is a number c such that f(x) = cx for all x. (This conclusion can be demonstrated simply by combining the results of two previous problems.) Point of information: There do exist noncontinuous functions f satisfying f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x and y, but we cannot prove this now; in fact, this simple question involves ideas that are usually never mentioned in undergraduate courses (see reference [7] in the Suggested Reading).

    Suppose that $ f $ is a function such that $ f(a) < f(b) $ whenever $ a < b $ (Figure 6).
    
    (a) Prove that $ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) $ and $ \lim_{x \to b} f(x) $ both exist. Hint: Why is this problem in this chapter?
    
    (b) Prove that $ f $ never has a removable discontinuity (this terminology comes from Problem 6-17).
    
    (c) Prove that if $ f $ satisfies the conclusions of the Intermediate Value Theorem, then $ f $ is continuous.
    
    If $ f $ is a bounded function on $ [0, 1] $, let $ \|f\| = \sup\{ | f(x)| : x \in [0, 1] \} $.
    Prove analogues of the properties of $ \|f\| $ in Problem 7-14.
    
    Suppose $ a > 0 $. Prove that every number $ x $ can be written uniquely in the form $ x = ka + x' $, where $ k $ is an integer, and $ 0 < x' < a $.
    
    (a) Suppose that $ a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots $ is a sequence of positive numbers with $ a_{n+1} < \frac{a_n}{2} $. Prove that for any $ \varepsilon > 0 $ there is some $ n $ with $ a_n < \varepsilon $.
    
    (b) Suppose $ P $ is a regular polygon inscribed inside a circle. If $ P' $ is the inscribed regular polygon with twice as many sides, show that the difference between the area of the circle and the area of $ P' $ is less than half the difference between the area of the circle and the area of $ P $ (use Figure 7).
    
    (c) Prove that there is a regular polygon $ P $ inscribed in a circle with area as close as desired to the area of the circle. In order to do part (c) you will need part (a). This was clear to the Greeks, who used part (a) as the basis for their entire treatment of proportion and area. By calculating the areas of polygons, this method ("the method of exhaustion") allows computations of $ \pi $ to any desired accuracy; Archimedes used it to show that $ \frac{22}{7} < \pi < \frac{22}{7} $. But it has far greater theoretical importance:
    
    (d) Using the fact that the areas of two regular polygons with the same number of sides are in a ratio equal to the square of the ratio of their circumradii, prove that the method of exhaustion is a valid method for computing limits.

Hint: Deduce a contradiction from the assumption that the ratio of the areas is greater, or less, than the ratio of the square of the radii by inscribing appropriate polygons.

Hint: The inequality sup(A+B) < sup A+sup B is easy. Why? 'To prove that sup A + sup B < sup(A + B) it suffices to prove that sup A+ sup B < sup(A + B) + € for all € > 0; begin by choosing x in A and y in B with sup A — x < €/2 and sup B — y < €/2.

    Suppose f is continuous on [a,b] and f(a) < 0 < f(b). Then either  
    f((a + b)/2) = 0, or f has different signs at the end points of the interval  
    [a, (a + b)/2], or f has different signs at the end points of [(a + b)/2, b].  
    Why? If f((a + b)/2) ≠ 0, let I be the interval on which f changes sign.  
    Now bisect I. Either f is 0 at the midpoint, or f changes sign on one of the  
    two intervals. Let I be that interval. Continue in this way, to define I for  
    each n (unless f is 0 at some midpoint). Use the Nested Interval Theorem  
    to find a point x where f(x) = 0.
    
    Suppose f were continuous on [a,b], but not bounded on [a,b]. Then f

    A number x is called an almost upper bound for A if there are only  
    finitely many numbers y in A with y > x. An almost lower bound is  
    defined similarly.

    APPENDIX. UNIFORM CONTINUITY
    
    »>
    
    Now that we've come to the end of the "foundations," it might be appropriate
    to slip in one further fundamental concept. This notion is not used crucially in
    the rest of the book, but it can help clarify many points later on.
    
    We know that the function f(x) = x? is continuous at a for all a. In other
    words,
  - |-
    If a is any number, then for every ε > 0 there is some δ > 0  
    such that, for all x, if |x — a| < δ, then |f(x) — a²| < ε.
    
    Of course, δ depends on ε. But δ also depends on a—the δ that works at a might  
    not work at b (Figure 1). Indeed, it's clear that given ε > 0 there is no one δ > 0  
    that works for all a, or even for all positive a. In fact, the number a + δ/2 will  
    certainly satisfy |x — a| < δ, but if a > 0, then  
    
    (a + δ)² = a² + 2aδ + δ²  
    |f(a + δ) — a²| = |(a + δ)² — a²| = |2aδ + δ²|  
    
    and this won't be < ε once a > ε/(2δ). (This is just an admittedly confusing compu-  
    tational way of saying that f is growing faster and faster!)
    
    On the other hand, for any ε > 0 there will be one δ > 0 that works for all a  
    in any interval [—N, N]. In fact, the δ which works at N or —N will also work  
    everywhere else in the interval.
    
    As a final example, consider the function f(x) = sin(1/x), or the function whose  
    graph appears in Figure 18 on page 62. It is easy to see that, so long as ε < 1,  
    there will not be one δ > 0 that works for these functions at all points a in the  
    open interval (0, 1).
    
    These examples illustrate important distinctions between the behavior of various  
    continuous functions on certain intervals, and there is a special term to signal this  
    distinction.
    
    The function f is uniformly continuous on an interval A if for every ε > 0  
    there is some δ > 0 such that, for all x and y in A,  
    
    if |x — y| < δ, then |f(x) — f(y)| < ε.
  - |-
    We've seen that a function can be continuous on the whole line, or on an open
    interval, without being uniformly continuous there. On the other hand, the func-
    tion f(x) = x² did turn out to be uniformly continuous on any closed interval.
    This shouldn't be too surprising—it's the same sort of thing that occurs when we
    ask whether a function is bounded on an interval —and we would be led to suspect
    that any continuous function on a closed interval is also uniformly continuous on
    that interval. In order to prove this, we'll need to deal first with one subtle point.
    
    Suppose that we have two intervals [a,b] and [b,c] with the common end-
    point b, and a function f that is continuous on [a,c]. Let ε > 0 and suppose that
    the following two statements hold:
    
    (1) if x and y are in [a, b] and |x — y| < δ1, then | f(x) — f(y)| < ε,
    (2) if x and y are in [b,c] and |x — y| < δ2, then | f(x) — f(y)| < ε.
    
    We'd like to know if there is some δ > 0 such that | f(x) — f(y)| < ε whenever
    x and y are points in [a,c] with |x — y| < δ. Our first inclination might be to
    choose δ as the minimum of δ1 and δ2. But it is easy to see what goes wrong
    (Figure 2): we might have x in [a,b] and y in [b,c], and then neither (1) nor (2)
    tells us anything about | f(x) — f(y)|. So we have to be a little more careful, and
    also use continuity of f at b.
    
    Let a < b < c and let f be continuous on the interval [a,c]. Let ε > 0, and
    suppose that statements (1) and (2) hold. Then there is a δ > 0 such that,

    if x and y are in [a,c] and |x — y| < 6, then | f(x) — f(y)| < «.
    
    Since f is continuous at b, there is a 63 > O such that,
    
    if |x — b| < 43, then | f(x) — f(b)| < =
    
    It follows that
    (a) if |x —b| < 63 and |y —b| < 43, then | f(x) — f(y)| <e.
    
    Choose 6 to be the minimum of 6;, 59, and 63. We claim that this 6 works. In
    fact, suppose that x and y are any two points in [a,c] with |x — y| < 6. If x and y
    are both in [a, b], then | f(x) — f(y)| < & by (i); and if x and y are both in [b, c],
    then | f(x) — f(y)| < € by (1). The only other possibility is that
    
    x<b<y or y<b<x.
    In either case, since |x — y| < 6, we also have |x — b| < 6 and |y — b| < 6. So
    If (x) — f(y)| < € by Gi). J
    
    If f 1s continuous on [a, b], then f 1s uniformly continuous on [a, bd].
    
    It's the usual trick, but we've got to be a little bit careful about the mechanism of
    the proof. For e > OQ let's say that f is e-good on [a, b] if there is some 6 > O such
    that, for all y and z in [a, D],
    
    if |y —z| < 4, then | f(y) — f(z) <e.
    
    Then we're trying to prove that f is e€-good on [a, b] for all ¢ > 0.
    Consider any particular e > QO. Let
    
    A={x:a<x <band f 1s e-good on [a, x]}.

    Then A # @ (since a is in A), and A 1s bounded above (by 5), so A has a least
    upper bound a@. We really should write a@,, since A and a might depend on e. But
    we won't since we intend to prove that a = b, no matter what é is.
    
    146 Foundations
    
    Suppose that we had a < b. Since f is continuous at a, there is some dg > O
    such that, f |y —a@| < do, then | f(y) — f(@)| < e/2. Consequently, if |y —a@| < do
    and |z — a| < dg, then | f(y) — f(z)| < €. So f is surely €-good on the interval
    [a — d9.a@ + do]. On the other hand, since @ is the least upper bound of A, it
    is also clear that f 1s €-good on [a,a@ — do]. Then the Lemma implies that f 1s
    e-good on [a,a + d9], so a + dg Is in A, contradicting the fact that a@ is an upper
    bound.
    
    To complete the proof we just have to show that a = bis actually in A. The

    In 1604, at the height of
    
    his scientific career, Galileo argued
    that for a rectilinear motion
    
    in which speed increases proportionally
    to distance covered,
    
    the law of motion should be
    
    just that (x = ct?)
    
    which he had discovered
    
    in the investigation of falling bodies.
    Between 1695 and 1700
    
    not a single one of the monthly issues
    of Leipzig's Acta Eruditorum was published
    without articles of Leibniz,
    
    the Bernoulli brothers
    
    or the Marquis de (Hopital treating,
    with notation only slightly different from
    that which we use today,
    
    the most varied problems of
    differential calculus, integral calculus
    and the calculus of variations.

    one century

    The derivative of a function is the first of the two major concepts of this section.
    Together with the integral, it constitutes the source from which calculus derives
    its particular flavor. While it is true that the concept of a function is fundamental,
    that you cannot do anything without limits or continuity, and that least upper
    bounds are essential, everything we have done until now has been preparation—if
    adequate, this section will be easier than the preceding ones—for the really exciting
    ideas to come, the powerful concepts that are truly characteristic of calculus.
    
    Perhaps (some would say "certainly") the interest of the ideas to be introduced
    in this section stems from the intimate connection between the mathematical con-
    cepts and certain physical ideas. Many definitions, and even some theorems, may
    be described in terms of physical problems, often in a revealing way. In fact, the
    demands of physics were the original inspiration for these fundamental ideas of
    calculus, and we shall frequently mention the physical interpretations. But we
    shall always first define the ideas in precise mathematical form, and discuss their
    significance in terms of mathematical problems.
    
    The collection of all functions exhibits such diversity that there is almost no
    hope of discovering any interesting general properties pertaining to all. Because
    continuous functions form such a restricted class, we might expect to find some
    nontrivial theorems pertaining to them, and the sudden abundance of theorems
    after Chapter 6 shows that this expectation is justified. But the most interesting
    and most powerful results about functions will be obtained only when we restrict
    our attention even further, to functions which have even greater claim to be called
    "reasonable," which are even better behaved than most continuous functions.
    
    f(x) = |x|, x = 0  
    f(x) = x^*, x < 0  
    f(x) = |x|  
    f(x) = √x!  
    FIGURE 1 (a) (b) (c)
    
    Figure 1 illustrates certain types of misbehavior which continuous functions can
    display. ‘The graphs of these functions are "bent" at (0,0), unlike the graph of
    Figure 2, where it is possible to draw a "tangent line" at each point. The quotation
    marks have been used to avoid the suggestion that we have defined "bent" or

    "tangent line," although we are suggesting that the graph might be "bent" at a
    point where a "tangent line" cannot be drawn. You have probably already noticed
    that a tangent line cannot be defined as a line which intersects the graph only
    once—such a definition would be both too restrictive and too permissive. With
    such a definition, the straight line shown in Figure 3 would not be a tangent line
    to the graph in that picture, while the parabola would have two tangent lines at
    each point (Figure 4), and the three functions in Figure 5 would have more than
    one tangent line at the points where they are "bent."
    
    (a) (b) (c)
    
    FIGURE 5
    
    A more promising approach to the definition of a tangent line might start with
    "secant lines," and use the notion of limits. If h → 0, then the two distinct points
    (a, f(a)) and (a +h, f(a +h)) determine, as in Figure 6, a straight line whose
    slope is
    
    [f(a +h) — f(a)] / h
    
    (a+h, f(a+h))
    
    (a, f(a))
    
    FIGURE 6
    
    As Figure 7 illustrates, the "tangent line" at (a, f(a)) seems to be the limit, in
    some sense, of these "secant lines" as h approaches 0. We have never before
    talked about a "limit" of lines, but we can talk about the limit of their slopes: the
    slope of the tangent line through (a, f(a)) should be
    
    lim [f(a +h) — f(a)] / h
    
    h→0
    
    We are ready for a definition, and some comments.
    
    The function f is differentiable at a if
    
    lim [f(a +h) — f(a)] / h
    
    h→0
    
    exists.
    
    In this case the limit is denoted by f'(a) and is called the derivative of f at
    a. (We also say that f is differentiable if f is differentiable at a for every a
    in the domain of f.)
  - |-
    The first comment on our definition is really an addendum; we define the tangent line to the graph of f at (a, f(a)) to be the line through (a, f(a)) with slope f'(a). This means that the tangent line at (a, f(a)) is defined only if f is differentiable at a.
    
    The second comment refers to notation. The symbol f'(a) is certainly reminiscent of functional notation. In fact, for any function f, we denote by f' the function whose domain is the set of all numbers a such that f is differentiable at a, and whose value at such a number a is
    
    lim [f(a + h) - f(a)] / h
    h→0
    
    (To be very precise: f is the collection of all pairs (a, f(a)) for which the limit
    lim [f(a + h) - f(a)] / h exists.) The function f' is called the derivative
    h→0
    
    of f.
    
    Our third comment, somewhat longer than the previous two, refers to the physical interpretation of the derivative. Consider a particle which is moving along a straight line (Figure 8(a)) on which we have chosen an "origin" point O, and a direction in which distances from O shall be written as positive numbers, the distance from O of points in the other direction being written as negative numbers.
    Let s(t) denote the distance of the particle from O, at time t. The suggestive notation s(t) has been chosen purposely; since a distance s(t) is determined for each
    
    t = 0 O 0 t = 1

    It has a natural physical interpretation. It is the "average velocity" of the particle
    during the time interval from a to a +h. For any particular a, this average speed
    depends on h, of course. On the other hand, the limit
    
    . s(a+h) —s(a)
    lim
    h→0 h
    
    depends only on a (as well as the particular function s) and there are important
    physical reasons for considering this limit. We would like to speak of the "velocity
    of the particle at time a," but the usual definition of velocity is really a definition
    of average velocity; the only reasonable definition of "velocity at time a" (so-called
    "instantaneous velocity") is the limit
    
    . s(a+h) —s(a)
    lim
    h→0 h
    
    Thus we define the (instantaneous) velocity of the particle at a to be s'(a).
    Notice that s'(a) could easily be negative; the absolute value |s'(a)| is sometimes
    called the (instantaneous) speed.
    
    It is important to realize that instantaneous velocity is a theoretical concept,
    an abstraction which does not correspond precisely to any observable quantity.
    While it would not be fair to say that instantaneous velocity has nothing to do
    with average velocity, remember that s'(t) is not
    
    s(t +h) — s(t)
    h
    
    for any particular h, but merely the limit of these average velocities as h ap-
    proaches 0. ‘Thus, when velocities are measured in physics, what a physicist really
    measures is an average velocity over some (very small) time interval; such a pro-
    cedure cannot be expected to give an exact answer, but this is really no defect,
    because physical measurements can never be exact anyway.
    
    The velocity of a particle is often called the "rate of change of its position." This
    notion of the derivative, as a rate of change, applies to any other physical situation
    in which some quantity varies with time. For example, the "rate of change of
    mass" of a growing object means the derivative of the function m, where m(t) is
    the mass at time t.

    In order to become familiar with the basic definitions of this chapter, we will  
    spend quite some time examining the derivatives of particular functions. Before  
    proving the important theoretical results of Chapter 11, we want to have a good  
    idea of what the derivative of a function looks like. The next chapter is devoted  
    exclusively to one aspect of this problem— calculating the derivative of complicated  
    functions. In this chapter we will emphasize the concepts, rather than the

    Thus f is differentiable at a for every number a, and f(a) = 0. ‘This means that  
    the tangent line to the graph of f always has slope 0, so the tangent line always  
    coincides with the graph.  
    
    Constant functions are not the only ones whose graphs coincide with their tan-  
    gent lines—this happens for any linear function f(x) = cx + d. Indeed

    the slope of the tangent line is c, the same as the slope of the graph of ff.

    f (a) = lm

    Some of the tangent lines to the graph of f are shown in Figure 9. In this picture
    each tangent line appears to intersect the graph only once, and this fact can be
    checked fairly easily: Since the tangent line through (a, a) has slope 2a, it is the
    graph of the function
    
    g(x) = 2a(x —a) + a'
    
    — Pax — a'.
    
    Now, if the graphs of f and g intersect at a point (x, f(x)) = (x, g(x)), then
    
    x? = 2ax —a'
    
    9.
    or x? —2ax +a* = 0:
    so (x —a)* =0
    or xX =a.
    
    In other words, (a, a7) is the only point of intersection.

    The function f(x) = x* happens to be quite special in this regard; usually a
    tangent line will intersect the graph more than once. Consider, for example, the
    function f(x) = x°. In this case

    h—
    
    f(a) = hm
    
    — 3q°.
    
    Thus the tangent line to the graph of f at (a,a°) has slope 3a*. This means that
    the tangent line is the graph of
    
    g(x) = 3a*(x —a) +a?
    — 3a*x — 2a?.
    
    The graphs of f and g intersect at the point (x, f(x)) = (x, g(x)) when
    
    x? = 3a*x — 2a?
    or x°?—3a*x+2a? = 0.
  - |-
    This equation is easily solved if we remember that one solution of the equation  
    has got to be x = a, so that (x — a) is a factor of the left side; the other factor can  
    then be found by dividing. We obtain  
    
    (x — a)(x² + ax — 2a) = 0).  
    It so happens that x² + ax — 2a also has x — a as a factor; we obtain finally  
    (x —a)(x —a)(x + 2a) = 0).  
    
    Thus, as illustrated in Figure 10, the tangent line through (a, a²) also intersects  
    the graph at the point (—2a, —8a²). These two points are always distinct, except  
    when a = 0.  
    
    We have already found the derivative of sufficiently many functions to illustrate  
    the classical, and still very popular, notation for derivatives. For a given function f,  
    the derivative f' is often denoted by  
    
    df (x)  
    dx  
    for example, the symbol  
    d(x²)/dx  
    denotes the derivative of the function f(x) = x². Needless to say, the separate  
    parts of the expression  
    df (x)  
    dx  
    are not supposed to have any sort of independent existence—the d's are not num-  
    bers, they cannot be canceled, and the entire expression is not the quotient of two  
    other numbers "df(x)" and "dx." ‘This notation is due to Leibniz (generally  
    considered an independent co-discoverer of calculus, along with Newton), and is  
    affectionately referred to as Leibnizian notation.* Although the notation df (x)/dx  
    seems very complicated, in concrete cases it may be shorter; after all, the symbol  
    d(x²)/dx is actually more concise than the phrase "the derivative of the function  
    f(x) = x²."  
    
    The following formulas state in standard Leibnizian notation all the information  
    that we have found so far:  
    
    d(x²)  
    —— = 2x,  
    dx  
    d(ax + b)  
    —— = a,  
    dx  
    d(x³)  
    —— = 3x²,  
    dx  
    d(x³)  
    —— = 3x².  
    dx
  - |-
    Although the meaning of these formulas is clear enough, attempts at literal interpretation are hindered by the reasonable stricture that an equation should not contain a function on one side and a number on the other. For example, if the third equation is to be true, then either df(x)/dx must denote f'(x), rather than f', or else 2x must denote, not a number, but the function whose value at x is 2x. It is really impossible to assert that one or the other of these alternatives is intended; in practice df(x)/dx sometimes means f' and sometimes means f'(x), while 2x may denote either a number or a function. Because of this ambiguity, most authors are reluctant to denote f'(a) by
    
    df(x)/dx;
    
    instead f'(a) is usually denoted by the barbaric, but unambiguous, symbol
    
    df(x)
    dx
    
    x=a
    
    * Leibniz was led to this symbol by his intuitive notion of the derivative, which he considered to be, not the limit of quotients [f(x + h) — f(x)]/h, but the "value" of this quotient when h is an "infinitely small" number. This "infinitely small" quantity was denoted by dx and the corresponding "infinitely small" difference f(x + dx) — f(x) by df(x). Although this point of view is impossible to reconcile with properties (P1)-(P13) of the real numbers, some people find this notion of the derivative congenial.
    
    156 Derivatives and Integrals
    
    In addition to these difficulties, Leibnizian notation is associated with one more ambiguity. Although the notation df/dx is absolutely standard, the notation df(x)/dx is often replaced by df/dx. This, of course, is in conformity with the practice of confusing a function with its value at x. So strong is this tendency that functions are often indicated by a phrase like the following: "consider the function y = x2." We will sometimes follow classical practice to the extent of using y as the name of a function, but we will nevertheless carefully distinguish between the function and its values—thus we will always say something like "consider the function y = x2" rather than "consider the value y = x2."

    function (defined by) y(x) = x."
    
    Despite the many ambiguities of Leibnizian notation, it is used almost exclusively in older mathematical writing, and is still used very frequently today. The staunchest opponents of Leibnizian notation admit that it will be around for quite some time, while its most ardent admirers would say that it will be around for-ever, and a good thing too! In any case, Leibnizian notation cannot be ignored completely.
    
    The policy adopted in this book is to disallow Leibnizian notation within the text, but to include it in the Problems; several chapters contain a few (immediately recognizable) problems which are expressly designed to illustrate the vagaries of Leibnizian notation. 'Trusting that these problems will provide ample practice in this notation, we return to our basic task of examining some simple examples of derivatives.
    
    The few functions examined so far have all been differentiable. 'To fully appreciate the significance of the derivative it is equally important to know some examples of functions which are not differentiable. 'The obvious candidates are the three functions first discussed in this chapter, and illustrated in Figure 1; if they turn out to be differentiable at 0 something has clearly gone wrong.
    
    Consider first f(x) = |x|. In this case
    
    f(0+h) - f(0) = |h|
    h h
    
    Now |h|/h = 1 for h > 0, and |h|/h = -1 for h < 0. This shows that
    
    lim [f(h) - f(0)] / h
    h→0
    
    does not exist.
    
    In fact,
    
    lim [f(h) - f(0)] / h = lim |h| / h
    h→0+ h→0+
    
    and lim [f(h) - f(0)] / h = lim |h| / h
    h→0- h→0-
    
    (These two limits are sometimes called the right-hand derivative and the left-hand derivative, respectively, of f at 0.)

    f_i(x) = 1 \text{ if } x > 0,
    $$
    $$
    f_i(x) = -1 \text{ if } x < 0.
    $$
    
    The proof of this fact is left to you (it is easy if you remember the derivative of a
    linear function). The graphs of $ f $ and of $ f' $ are shown in Figure 11.
    For the function
    $$
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } x > 0, \\
    -1 & \text{if } x < 0.
    \end{cases}
    $$
    a similar difficulty arises in connection with $ f'(0) $. We have
    
    $$
    \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = \frac{1}{h} \text{ if } h > 0,
    $$
    $$
    \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = \frac{-1}{h} \text{ if } h < 0.
    $$
    
    Therefore,
    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = 1,
    $$
    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = -1.
    $$
    
    Thus $ f'(0) $ does not exist; $ f $ is not differentiable at 0. Once again, however, $ f'(x) $
    exists for $ x \neq 0 $. It is easy to see that
    
    $$
    f'(x) = \begin{cases}
    2 & \text{if } x > 0, \\
    -2 & \text{if } x < 0.
    \end{cases}
    $$
    
    The graphs of $ f $ and $ f' $ are shown in Figure 12.
    Even worse things happen for $ f(x) = \sqrt{|x|} $. For this function

    \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = \frac{\sqrt{|h|}}{h} \text{ if } h > 0,
    $$
    $$
    \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h} = \frac{\sqrt{|h|}}{h} \text{ if } h < 0.
    $$
    
    In this case the right-hand limit
    
    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h}
    $$
    
    does not exist; instead $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{h}} $ becomes arbitrarily large as $ h $ approaches 0. And,
    what's more, $ \frac{-1}{\sqrt{-h}} $ becomes arbitrarily large in absolute value, but negative
    
    (Figure 13).
    $$
    \boxed{158} \text{ Derivatives and Integrals}

    $$
    \frac{d}{dx} \left( x \right) = 1.
    $$
    
    The function $ f(x) = x $, although not differentiable at 0, is at least a little
    better behaved than this. The quotient
    
    $$
    \frac{f(h) - f(0)}{h}
    $$
    
    simply becomes arbitrarily large as $ h $ goes to 0. Sometimes one says that $ f $ has no derivative at 0, but it does have a derivative everywhere else.

    An "infinite" derivative at 0. Geometrically this means that the graph of f has a
    "tangent line" which is parallel to the vertical axis (Figure 14). Of course, f(x) =
    
    — s/x has the same geometric property, but one would say that f has a derivative
    of "negative infinity" at 0.
    
    Remember that differentiability is supposed to be an improvement over mere
    continuity. This idea is supported by the many examples of functions which are
    continuous, but not differentiable; however, one important point remains to be
    noted:
    
    If f is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a.
    
    f(a + h) — f(a)
    
    lim f(a + h) — f(a) = lim (f(a + h) — f(a)) / h
    h—0 h h—0
    = f'(a) - 0
    = ().
    
    As we pointed out in Chapter 5, the equation lim f(a + h) — f(a) = 0 is equivalent
    
    to lim f(x) = f(a); thus f is continuous at a. J
    x—7a
    
    It is very important to remember Theorem 1, and just as important to remember
    that the converse is not true. A differentiable function is continuous, but a con-
    tinuous function need not be differentiable (keep in mind the function f(x) = |x|,
    and you will never forget which statement is true and which false).
    
    The continuous functions examined so far have been differentiable at all points
    with at most one exception, but it is easy to give examples of continuous functions
    which are not differentiable at several points, even an infinite number (Figure 15).
    Actually, one can do much worse than this. There is a function which is continuous

    everywhere and differentiable nowhere! Unfortunately, the definition of this function will
    be inaccessible to us until Chapter 24, and I have been unable to persuade the
    artist to draw it (consider carefully what the graph should look like and you will
    sympathize with her point of view). It is possible to draw some rough approxima-
    tions to the graph, however; several successively better approximations are shown
    
    in Figure 16.
  - |-
    Although such spectacular examples of nondifferentiability must be postponed, we can, with a little ingenuity, find a continuous function which is not differentiable at infinitely many points, all of which are in [0, 1]. One such function is illustrated in Figure 17. The reader is given the problem of defining it precisely; it is a straight line version of the function
    
    . | 0
    f(x) = x sin —, x ≠ 0,
    Q, x = 0.
    
    This particular function f is itself quite sensitive to the question of differentiability: Indeed, for h ≠ 0 we have
    f(h) - f(0) = h sin —.
    h h
    
    Long ago we proved that lim sin (|/h) does not exist, so f is not differentiable at 0.
    
    h—0
    
    Geometrically, one can see that a tangent line cannot exist, by noting that the secant line through (0,0) and (h, f(h)) in Figure 18 can have any slope between
    —1 and 1, no matter how small we require h to be.
    
    Figure 18
    
    This finding represents something of a triumph; although continuous, the func-
    tion f seems somehow quite unreasonable, and we can now enunciate one math-
    ematically undesirable feature of this function—it is not differentiable at 0. Nevertheless, one should not become too enthusiastic about the criterion of differen-
    tiability. For example, the function
    
    FIGURE 18
    
    l
    2. 4
    a(x) = x* sin —, x ≥ 0,
    
    QO, x =0
    is differentiable at 0; in fact g'(O) = 0:

    h? sin —

    h—O h h—O h
    
    = lim fh sin —
    h—OQ h
    
    = 0.
    
    The tangent line to the graph of g at (0,0) is therefore the horizontal axis (Fig-
    ure 19).
  - |-
    This example suggests that we should seek even more restrictive conditions on a function than mere differentiability. We can actually use the derivative to formulate such conditions if we introduce another set of definitions, the last of this chapter.
    
    9. Derivatives 161
    
    FIGURE 19
    
    For any function f, we obtain, by taking the derivative, a new function f' (whose domain may be considerably smaller than that of f). The notion of differentiability can be applied to the function f', of course, yielding another function (f')', whose domain consists of all points a such that f' is differentiable at a. The function (f')' is usually written simply f'' and is called the second derivative of f.
    If f(a) exists, then f is said to be 2-times differentiable at a, and the number f''(a) is called the second derivative of f at a.
    
    In physics the second derivative is particularly important. If s(t) is the position at time t of a particle moving along a straight line, then s''(t) is called the acceleration at time t. Acceleration plays a special role in physics, because, as stated in Newton's laws of motion, the force on a particle is the product of its mass and its acceleration. Consequently you can feel the second derivative when you sit in an accelerating car.
    
    There is no reason to stop at the second derivative—we can define f'' = (f')', f''' = (f'')', etc. This notation rapidly becomes unwieldy, so the following abbreviation is usually adopted (it is really a recursive definition):
    
    f^{(1)} = f'
    f^{(2)} = f''
    f^{(3)} = f'''
    f^{(4)} = f^{(4)}
    etc.
    
    The various functions f^{(k)}, for k > 2, are sometimes called higher-order derivatives of f.
    
    Usually, we resort to the notation f^{(k)} only for k > 4, but it is convenient to have f defined for smaller k also. In fact, a reasonable definition can be made for f^{(0)}, namely,
    
    f^{(0)} = f.
  - |-
    Leibnizian notation for higher-order derivatives should also be mentioned. The  
    natural Leibnizian symbol for f ''(x), namely,  
    
    $$
    \frac{d^2}{dx^2} f(x)
    $$  
    is abbreviated to  
    $$
    \frac{d^2 f(x)}{dx^2}
    $$  
    or more frequently to  
    $$
    f''(x)
    $$  
    Similar notation is used for $ f^{(n)}(x) $.  
    
    The following example illustrates the notation $ f''(x) $, and also shows, in one very  
    simple case, how various higher-order derivatives are related to the original func-  
    tion. Let $ f(x) = x^7 $. Then, as we have already checked,  
    $$
    f'(x) = 7x^6,
    $$  
    $$
    f''(x) = 42x^5,
    $$  
    $$
    f'''(x) = 210x^4,
    $$  
    $$
    f^{(4)}(x) = 840x^3,
    $$  
    $$
    f^{(5)}(x) = 2520x^2,
    $$  
    $$
    f^{(6)}(x) = 5040x,
    $$  
    $$
    f^{(7)}(x) = 5040,
    $$  
    $$
    f^{(8)}(x) = 0, \text{ if } k > 7.
    $$  
    
    Figure 20 shows the function $ f $, together with its various derivatives.  
    A rather more illuminating example is presented by the following function,  
    (b) whose graph is shown in Figure 21 (a):  
    
    $$
    f(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
    x, & x > 0 \\
    -2x, & x < 0 \\
    2, & x = 0
    \end{cases}
    $$  
    
    It is easy to see that  
    $$
    f(a) = 2a \text{ if } a > 0,
    $$  
    $$
    f'(a) = -2a \text{ if } a < 0.
    $$  
    
    Moreover,  
    $$
    f''(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
    2, & x > 0 \\
    -2, & x < 0 \\
    \text{undefined}, & x = 0
    \end{cases}
    $$  
    $$
    f'''(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
    0, & x > 0 \\
    0, & x < 0 \\
    \text{undefined}, & x = 0

    $$  
    $$
    f^{(k)}(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
    0, & x > 0 \\
    0, & x < 0 \\
    \text{undefined}, & x = 0 \text{ for } k > 2
    \end{cases}
    $$  
    
    This information can all be summarized as follows:  
    $$
    f(x) = 2|x|
    $$  
    $$
    f'(x) = 2\text{sgn}(x)
    $$  
    $$
    f''(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
    2, & x > 0 \\
    -2, & x < 0 \\

    \end{cases}
    $$  
    $$
    f'''(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
    0, & x > 0 \\
    0, & x < 0 \\
    \text{undefined}, & x = 0

    f^{(k)}(x) =

    0, & x > 0 \\

    It follows that f''(0) does not exist! Existence of the second derivative is thus a
    rather strong criterion for a function to satisfy. Even a "smooth looking" function
    like f reveals some irregularity when examined with the second derivative. 'This
    suggests that the irregular behavior of the function
    
    g(x) = x² sin(1/x), x ≠ 0
    
    g(0) = 0
    
    might also be revealed by the second derivative. At the moment we know that
    g'(0) = 0, but we do not know g'(a) for any a ≠ 0, so it is hopeless to begin
    computing g''(0). We will return to this question at the end of the next chapter,
    after we have perfected the technique of finding derivatives.
    
    PROBLEMS
    
    1. (a) Prove, working directly from the definition, that if f(x) = 1/x, then
    f'(a) = -1/a², for a ≠ 0.
    (b) Prove that the tangent line to the graph of f at (a, 1/a) does not intersect
    the graph of f, except at (a, 1/a).

    (b) Prove that the tangent line to f at (a, 1/a²) intersects f at one other
    point, which lies on the opposite side of the vertical axis.
    
    3. Prove that if f(x) = 1/√x, then f'(a) = 1/(2√a), for a > 0. (The expression
    you obtain for [f(a + h) - f(a)]/h will require some algebraic manipulation,
    but the answer should suggest the right trick.)

    If you do not find this problem silly, you are missing a very important point:  
    f'(x*) means the derivative of f at the number which we happen to be

    (b) Show that the conclusion does not follow if we omit the hypothesis $ f(a) = g(a) = h(a) $.
    
    Let $ f $ be any polynomial function; we will see in the next chapter that $ f $ is differentiable. The tangent line to $ f $ at $ (a, f(a)) $ is the graph of $ g(x) = f'(a)(x - a) + f(a) $. Thus $ f(x) - g(x) $ is the polynomial function $ d(x) = f(x) - f'(a)(x - a) - f(a) $. We have already seen that if $ f(x) = x $, then $ d(x) = (x - a)^2 $, and if $ f(x) = x^2 $, then $ d(x) = (x - a)^2(x + 2a) $.

    (b) "There certainly seems to be some evidence that $ d(x) $ is always divisible by $ (x - a)^2 $.

The important thing here is that we actually have it, so we are only considering positive $ h $ and $ k $.
    
    Prove that if $ f $ is even, then $ f'(x) = -f'(-x) $. (In order to minimize confusion, let $ g(x) = f(-x) $; find $ g'(x) $ and then remember what other thing $ g $ is.) Draw a picture!
    
    Prove that if $ f $ is odd, then $ f'(x) = f'(-x) $. Once again, draw a picture.
    
    Problems 23 and 24 say that $ f' $ is even if $ f $ is odd, and odd if $ f $ is even. What can therefore be said about $ f $?

    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{S_n(x + h) - S_n(x)}{h}

    DIFFERENTIATION

    The process of finding the derivative of a function is called differentiation. From the previous chapter you may have the impression that this process is usually laborious, requires recourse to the definition of the derivative, and depends upon successfully recognizing some limit. It is true that such a procedure is often the only possible approach—if you forget the definition of the derivative you are likely to be lost. Nevertheless, in this chapter we will learn to differentiate a large number of functions, without the necessity of even recalling the definition. A few theorems will provide a mechanical process for differentiating a large class of functions, which are formed from a few simple functions by the process of addition, multiplication, division, and composition. This description should suggest what theorems will be proved. We will first find the derivative of a few simple functions, and then prove theorems about the sum, products, quotients, and compositions of differentiable functions. The first theorem is merely a formal recognition of a computation carried out in the previous chapter.
    
    If f is a constant function, f(x) = c, then
    
    f'(a) = 0 for all numbers a.
    
    f(a + h) — f(a) . e - c
    = lim
    
    = 0.
    h → 0 .
    
    f(a) = fin
    
    The second theorem is also a special case of a computation in the last chapter.
    
    If f is the identity function, f(x) = x, then
    
    f(a) = 1 for all numbers a.
    
    f(a + h) — f(a)
    
    f(a) h > 0 h
    a + h - a
    = lim
    h → 0
    h
    = lim — = 1.
    h → 0 .
    
    The derivative of the sum of two functions is just what one would hope—the sum of the derivatives.

    The formula for the derivative of a product is not as simple as one might wish, but it is nevertheless pleasantly symmetric, and the proof requires only a simple algebraic trick, which we have found useful before—a number is not changed if the same quantity is added to and subtracted from it.
    
    If $ f $ and $ g $ are differentiable at $ a $, then $ f - g $ is also differentiable at $ a $, and
    $$
    (f - g)'(a) = f'(a) - g'(a)

    $$
    (f - g)(a + h) - (f - g)(a)

    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \left[ \frac{f(a+h)g(a+h) - f(a)g(a+h)}{h} + \frac{f(a)g(a+h) - f(a)g(a)}{h} \right]

    $$
    $$
    = g(a)f'(a) + f(a)g'(a)
    $$
    
    (Notice that we have used Theorem 9-1! to conclude that $\lim_{h \to 0} f(a+h) = f(a)$. J)
    
    In one special case Theorem 4 simplifies considerably:
    
    If $ g(x) = c f(x) $ and $ f $ is differentiable at $ a $, then $ g $ is differentiable at $ a $, and
    $$
    g'(a) = c f'(a)
    $$
    
    If $ h(x) = c $, so that $ g = h - f $, then by Theorem 4,
    
    $$
    g'(a) = (h - f)'(a)
    = h'(a) - f'(a)
    $$
    $$
    = c - f'(a) + h'(a) - f(a)
    $$
    $$
    = c f'(a) + 0 - f(a)
    $$
    $$
    = c f'(a)
    $$

    Notice, in particular, that (— f)'(a) = — f'(a), and consequently (f — g)/(a) =
    (f + [-g])'(a) = f'(a) — g'(a).
    
    To demonstrate what we have already achieved, we will compute the derivative
    of some more special functions.
    
    THEOREM 6 If f(x) =x" for some natural number n, then
    
    f'(a) = na"! for all a.
    
    PROOF — The proof will be by induction on n. For n = 1 this is simply Theorem 2. Now
    assume that the theorem is true for n, so that if f(x) = x", then
    
    f(a) =na""! for all a.
    
    Let g(x) = x"*!, If I(x) = x, the equation x"*! = x" - x can be written
    
    e(x) = f(x)- T(x) for all x:
    thus g = f - I. It follows from Theorem 4 that
    g(a) =(f -I)'(a)= f'(a)- Ia) + f(a): I'(a)
    
    =na"'.a+a"-]
    = na" +a"
    = (n+ 1)a", for alla.
    
    This is precisely the case n + 1 which we wished to prove. J
    
    Putting together the theorems proved so far we can now find f/f' for f of the
    form
    
    F(X) = nx" + ay_jx" | + +++ Fagx® +aix +409.

    f" (x) =n(n - la x" 7 +(n — l)(n — 2)a,_)x"~? +-+-+ 2a).
    
    This process can be continued easily. Each differentiation reduces the highest
    power of x by 1, and eliminates one more a;. It is a good idea to work out the
    derivatives f'", f, and perhaps f®', until the pattern becomes quite clear. The
    last interesting derivative is
    
    f° (x) = nlan:
    
    for k >n we have
    
    f(x) —().

    Clearly, the next step in our program is to find the derivative of a quotient f/g.
    It is quite a bit simpler, and, because of Theorem 4, obviously sufficient to find
    the derivative of I/g.

    The general formula for the derivative of a quotient is now easy to derive.
    Though not particularly appealing, it is important, and must simply be memo-
    rized (I always use the incantation: "bottom times derivative of top, minus top
    times derivative of bottom, over bottom squared.")

    thus ‘Theorem 6 actually holds both for positive and negative integers. If we inter-
    pret f(x) = x° to mean f(x) = 1, and f'(x) = 0-x7! to mean f'(x) = 0, then
    Theorem 6 is true for n = O also. (The word "interpret" is necessary because it is
    
    not clear how 0° should be defined and, in any case, 0-07! is meaningless.)
    
    Further progress in differentiation requires the knowledge of the derivatives of
    certain special functions to be studied later. One of these is the sine function. For
    the moment we shall divulge, and use, the following information, without proof:
  - |-
    sin (a) = cosa for all a,
    cos (a) = —sina for all a,
    
    This information allows us to differentiate many other functions. For example, if
    
    f(x) =xsinx,
    then
    
    f'(x) =x cosx + sin x,
    f''(x) = —x sinx + cos x + cos x
    = —xsinx +2cosx:
    10. Differentiation 173
    
    if
    g(x) = sin' x = sinx - sinx,
    then
    g'(x) = sinx cosx + cos x sin x
    = 2s1n x cos X,
    g ''(x) = 2[(sin x)(—sin x) + cos x cos x]
    = 2[cos* x ~ sin? x];
    if
    h(x) = cos* x = cosx - COS X,
    then
    
    h'(x) = (cos x)(— sin x) + (— sin x) cos x
    = —2s1n x Cos x,
    h" (x) = —2[cos* x — sin? x].
    Notice that
    g(x) th'(x) =0,
    
    hardly surprising, since (g + h)(x) = sin? x + cos?
    
    also have g"(x) + h"(x) = 0.
    
    The examples above involved only products of two functions. A function involv-
    ing triple products can be handled by Theorem 4 also; in fact it can be handled
    in two ways. Remember that f - g-h 1s an abbreviation for
    
    (f-g)-h or f-(g-h).
    
    Choosing the first of these, for example, we have
    
    x = 1. As we would expect, we
    
    (f-g-h)y(x)=(f- 8) (x) h@)+(f-g)a)h'(x)
    = [f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g"(x) h(x) + f(x) g(x)h'(x)
    = f'(x)g(x)h(x) + f(x)g'(x)h(x) + f(x)g(x)h'(x).
    
    The choice of f - (g - 4) would, of course, have given the same result, with a
    different intermediate step. The final answer is completely symmetric and easily
    remembered:
  - |-
    (f - g - h)' is the sum of the three terms obtained by differentiating each of f, g, and A and multiplying by the other two.
    
    For example, if
    f(x) = x² sin x cosx,
    then
    
    f'(x) = 3x² sin x cosx + x² cos x cos x + x²(sin x)(- sin x).
    
    Products of more than 3 functions can be handled similarly. For example, you
    should have little difficulty deriving the formula
    
    (f - g - h - k)'(x) = f'(x)g(x)h(x)k(x) + f(x)g'(x)h(x)k(x)
    + f(x)g(x)h'(x)k(x) + f(x)g(x)h(x)k'(x).
    
    174 Derivatives and Integrals
    
    You might even try to prove (by induction) the general formula:
    
    (f₁f₂...fn)' = f'₁f₂...fn + f₁f'₂f₃...fn + ... + f₁f₂...f'n'.
    
    Differentiating the most interesting functions obviously requires a formula for
    (f ∘ g)'(x) in terms of f' and g'. To ensure that f ∘ g be differentiable at a, one
    reasonable hypothesis would seem to be that g be differentiable at a. Since the
    behavior of f ∘ g near a depends on the behavior of f near g(a) (not near a), it
    also seems reasonable to assume that f is differentiable at g(a). Indeed we shall
    prove that if g is differentiable at a and f is differentiable at g(a), then f ∘ g is
    differentiable at a, and
    
    (f ∘ g)'(a) = f'(g(a)) · g'(a).
    
    This extremely important formula is called the Chain Rule, presumably because
    a composition of functions might be called a "chain" of functions. Notice that
    (f ∘ g)' is practically the product of f' and g', but not quite: f' must be evaluated
    at g(a) and g' at a. Before attempting to prove this theorem we will try a few
    
    applications. Suppose
    
    f(x) = sin x².
    
    Let us, temporarily, use S to denote the ("squaring") function S(x) = x². Then
    f = sin ∘ S.
    Therefore we have
  - |-

    f'(x) = sin'(S(x)) + S'(x)
    
    = cos x? - 2x.
    Quite a different result is obtained if
    f(x)= sin? x.
    
    In this case
    f =Sosin,
    
    SO
    
    f'(x) = S'(sin x) - sin'(x)
    = 2sinx-cosx.
    
    Notice that this agrees (as it should) with the result obtained by writing f = sin - sin
    and using the product formula.
    
    Although we have invented a special symbol, S, to name the "squaring" function,
    it does not take much practice to do problems like this without bothering to write
    down special symbols for functions, and without even bothering to write down the
    particular composition which f is —-one soon becomes accustomed to taking f
    apart in one's head. The following differentiations may be used as practice for
    such mental gymnastics --if you find it necessary to work a few out on paper, by
    all means do so, but try to develop the knack of writing f' immediately after seeing
    the definition of f; problems of this sort are so simple that, if you just remember
    the Chain Rule, there is no thought necessary.

    f(x)= (x3 + 3x7) f(oy= 53(x7 + 3x7)°? (3x7 + 6x).
    
    A function like
    
    f(x)= sin? x* = [sin x7]?,
    which is the composition of three functions,
    f =Sosino §S,
    
    can also be differentiated by the Chain Rule. It is only necessary to remember
    that a triple composition fo goh means (f og)oh or fo(goh). Thus if
  - |-
    f(x) = sin* x?  
    we can write  
    
    f =(Sosin) oS,  
    f =So(sino $).  
    
    The derivative of either expression can be found by applying the Chain Rule  
    twice; the only doubtful point is whether the two expressions lead to equally simple  
    calculations. As a matter of fact, as any experienced differentiator knows, it is much  
    better to use the second:  
    
    f = So(sino S),  
    
    We can now write down f'(x) in one fell swoop. To begin with, note that the first  
    function to be differentiated is S, so the formula for f'(x) begins  
    
    f(x) = 2( )  
    
    Inside the parentheses we must put sin x7, the value at x of the second function,  
    sino $. Thus we begin by writing  
    
    f'(x) = 2sin x?  
    (the parentheses weren't really necessary, after all). We must now multiply this  
    much of the answer by the derivative of sino S at x; this part is easy—it involves a  
    composition of two functions, which we already know how to handle. We obtain, for the final answer,  
    
    f'(x) = 2sin x? + cosx* «2x.  
    176 = Derivatives and Integrals  
    
    The following example is handled similarly. Suppose  
    
    f(x) = sin(sin x2).  
    
    Without even bothering to write down f as a composition gohok of three functions,  
    we can see that the left-most one will be sin, so our expression for f'(x) begins  
    
    f(x) = cos( )  
    
    Inside the parentheses we must put the value of ho k(x); this is simply sin x* (what  
    you get from sin(sin x?) by deleting the first sin). So our expression for f'(x) begins  
    
    f(x) = cos(sin x')  
    
    We can now forget about the first sin in sin(sin x*); we have to multiply what we  
    have so far by the derivative of the function whose value at x is sin x"—-which is  
    again a problem we already know how to solve:  
    f(x) = cos(sin x) - cos.x? + 2x.

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:
    
    ---
    
    Finally, here are the derivatives of some other functions which are the composition
    of sin and S, as well as some other triple compositions. You can probably just
    "see" that the answers are correct—if not, try writing out f as a composition:
    
    If $ f(x) = \sin(\sin x) $ then $ f'(x) = \cos(\sin x) \cdot \cos x $
    
    $ f(x) = [\sin(\sin x)]' $, $ f'(x) = 2\sin(\sin x) \cdot \cos(\sin x) \cdot \cos x $
    
    $ f(x) = \sin(\sin(\sin x)) $, $ f'(x) = \cos(\sin(\sin x)) \cdot \cos(\sin x) \cdot \cos x $
    
    $ f(x) = \sin^2(x \sin x) $, $ f'(x) = 2\sin(x \sin x) \cdot \cos(x \sin x) \cdot (\cos x \sin x + x \cos x) $
    
    $ [ \sin x + x \cos x ] $
    
    $ f(x) = \sin(\sin(x \sin x)) $, $ f'(x) = \cos(\sin(x \sin x)) \cdot \cos(x \sin x) \cdot (\cos x \sin x + x \cos x) $
    
    $ [ 2x \sin x + x^2 \cos x ] $
    
    The rule for treating compositions of four (or even more) functions is easy—
    always (mentally) put in parentheses starting from the innermost,
    
    $ f \circ g \circ h \circ k $,

    With these examples as reference, you require only one thing to become a master differentiator—practice. You can be safely turned loose on the exercises at the end of the chapter, and it is now high time that we proved the Chain Rule.
    
    The following argument, while not a proof, indicates some of the tricks one might try, as well as some of the difficulties encountered. We begin, of course, with the definition—
    
    $$
    \frac{(f \circ g)(a + h) - (f \circ g)(a)}{h} = \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{h}
    $$
    
    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{h}
    $$
    
    $$
    (f \circ g)'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{h}
    $$
    
    Somewhere in here we would like the expression for $ g'(a) $. One approach is to put it in by fiat:
    
    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{h}
    $$
    
    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{g(a + h) - g(a)} \cdot \frac{g(a + h) - g(a)}{h}
    $$
    
    This does not look bad, and it looks even better if we write
    
    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{g(a + h) - g(a)} \cdot \frac{g(a + h) - g(a)}{h}
    $$
    
    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a) + [g(a + h) - g(a)]) - f(g(a))}{g(a + h) - g(a)} \cdot \frac{g(a + h) - g(a)}{h}
    $$
    
    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a) + [g(a + h) - g(a)]) - f(g(a))}{g(a + h) - g(a)} \cdot \frac{g(a + h) - g(a)}{h}
    $$
    
    The second limit is the factor $ g'(a) $ which we want. If we let $ g(a + h) - g(a) = k $ (to be precise we should write $ k(h) $), then the first limit is
    
    $$
    = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a) + k) - f(g(a))}{k}
    $$
  - |-
    It looks as if this limit should be f'(g(a)), since continuity of g at a implies that k
    goes to 0 as h does. In fact, one can, and we soon will, make this sort of reasoning
    precise. [here is already a problem, however, which you will have noticed if you
    are the kind of person who does not divide blindly. Even for h ≠ 0 we might have
    g(a +h) — g(a) = 0, making the division and multiplication by g(a + h) — g(a)
    meaningless. True, we only care about small h, but g(a +h) — g(a) could be 0
    for arbitrarily small h. ‘The easiest way this can happen is for g to be a constant
    function, g(x) =c. Then g(a +h) — g(a) = 0 for all h. In this case, f o g is also
    a constant function, (f o g)(x) = f(c), so the Chain Rule does indeed hold:
    
    (fog) (a) =0= f'(g(a)) - g'(a).
    
    However, there are also nonconstant functions g for which g(a +h) — g(a) = 0
    for arbitrarily small h. For example, if a = 0, the function g might be
    g(x) = x² sin(1/x), for x ≠ 0,
    g(0) = 0.
    
    In this case, g'(0) = 0, as we showed in Chapter 9. If the Chain Rule is correct, we
    must have (f o g)'(0) = 0 for any differentiable f, and this is not exactly obvious.
    A proof of the Chain Rule can be found by considering such recalcitrant functions
    separately, but it is easier simply to abandon this approach, and use a trick.
    
    If g is differentiable at a, and f is differentiable at g(a), then fog is differentiable
    at a, and
    
    (fog)'(a) = f'(g(a)) · g'(a).
    
    Define a function φ as follows:

    $$
    \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{h} - \frac{f'(g(a)), \text{ if } g(a + h) - g(a) = 0.}
    $$
    It should be intuitively clear that $\alpha$ is continuous at 0: When $h$ is small,
    $g(a + h) - g(a)$ is also small, so if $g(a + h) - g(a)$ is not zero, then $\alpha(h)$ will
    be close to $f'(g(a));$ and if it is zero, then $\alpha(h)$ actually equals $f'(g(a))$, which
    is even better. Since the continuity of $\alpha$ is the crux of the whole proof we will
    provide a careful translation of this intuitive argument.
    
    We know that $f$ is differentiable at $g(a)$. This means that
    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(g(a) + h) - f(g(a))}{h} = f'(g(a))
    $$
    if $g(a + h) - g(a) \neq 0$.
    
    $$
    = f'(g(a)).
    $$
    
    Thus, if $\epsilon > 0$ there is some number $\delta > 0$ such that, for all $h$,
    $$
    \frac{f(g(a) + h) - f(g(a))}{h} \to f'(g(a)).
    $$
    
    Now $g$ is differentiable at $a$, hence continuous at $a$, so there is a $\delta > 0$ such that,
    for all $h$,
    
    (1) if $0 < |h| < \delta$, then $\left| \frac{f(g(a) + h) - f(g(a))}{h} - f'(g(a)) \right| < \epsilon$.
    
    (2) if $|h| < \delta$, then $|g(a + h) - g(a)| < \epsilon$.
    
    Consider now any $h$ with $|h| < \delta$. If $k = g(a + h) - g(a) \neq 0$, then
    
    $$
    \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a))}{h} = \frac{f(g(a) + k) - f(g(a))}{k} \cdot \frac{k}{h}.
    $$
    
    It follows from (2) that $|k| < \epsilon$, and hence from (1) that
    
    $$
    \left| \frac{f(g(a + h)) - f(g(a)))}{h} - f'(g(a)) \right| < \epsilon.
    $$
    
    On the other hand, if $g(a + h) - g(a) = 0$, then $\alpha(h) = f'(g(a))$, so it is surely
    true that
  - |-
    Ip(h) — f'(g(a))| < €.
    
    We have therefore proved that
    lim $(h) = f'(g(a)),
    
    so ¢ is continuous at 0. The rest of the proof is easy. If h → 0, then we have
    
    Pee LOY = guy BO)
    
    even if g(a +h) — g(a) = 0 (because in that case both sides are 0). Therefore

    (f 08) (a) = hm 1 lim @(h) « lim 7
    
    = f'(g(a))-g'(a).

    In Chapter 9 we showed that f'(O) = 0, working straight from the definition (the
    only possible way). For x 4 O we can use the methods of this chapter. We have

    Thus

    f(x) = 2xsin——cos—, x #0

    As this formula reveals, the first derivative f' is indeed badly behaved at 0—it is
    not even continuous there. If we consider instead

    0, x = 0.
    
    In this case f" is continuous at 0, but f"(0) does not exist (because the expres-
    sion 3x* sin 1/x defines a function which is differentiable at 0 but the expression
    —x cos 1/x does not).

    Let  
    $$ f(x) = x \sin x, \quad x \neq 0 $$  
    $$ f(0) = 0 $$  
    Then  
    $$ f'(x) = x \cos x - \sin x, \quad x \neq 0 $$  
    $$ f'(0) = 0 $$  
    
    It is easy to compute, right from the definition, that $ f''(0) = 0 $, and $ f''(x) $ is easy to find for $ x \neq 0 $:  
    $$ f''(x) = -x \sin x + 2 \cos x, \quad x \neq 0 $$  
    $$ f''(0) = 0 $$  
    
    In this case, the second derivative $ f'' $ is not continuous at 0. By now you may have guessed the pattern, which two of the problems ask you to establish: if  
    $$ f(x) = x \sin x, \quad x \leq 0 $$  
    $$ f(0) = 0 $$  
    then $ f'(0), \dots, f^{(n)}(0) $ exist, but $ f^{(n+1)} $ is not continuous at 0; if  
    $$ f(x) = x^2n+1 \sin x, \quad x \leq 0 $$  
    $$ f(0) = 0 $$  
    then $ f'(0), \dots, f^{(n)}(0) $ exist, and $ f $ is continuous at 0, but $ f^{(n+1)} $ is not differentiable at 0. These examples may suggest that "reasonable" functions can be characterized by the possession of higher-order derivatives—no matter how hard we try to mask the infinite oscillation of $ f(x) = \sin(1/x) $, a derivative of sufficiently high order seems able to reveal the underlying irregularity. Unfortunately, we will see later that much worse things can happen.
    
    After all these involved calculations, we will bring this chapter to a close with a minor remark. It is often tempting, and seems more elegant, to write some of the theorems in this chapter as equations about functions, rather than about their values. Thus Theorem 3 might be written  
    $$ (f + g)' = f' + g' $$  
    Theorem 4 might be written as  
    $$ (f - g)' = f' - g' $$  
    and Theorem 9 often appears in the form  
    $$ (f \circ g)' = f' \circ g \cdot g' $$

    Strictly speaking, these equations may be false, because the functions on the left-hand side might have a larger domain than those on the right. Nevertheless, this is hardly worth worrying about. If f and g are differentiable everywhere in their domains, then these equations, and others like them, are true, and this is the only case any one cares about.

    function, or a function that only takes on values in some interval (a, b), in  
    which case the behavior of f outside of (a, b) would be irrelevant.)

    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DERIVATIVE

    One aim in this chapter is to justify the time we have spent learning to find the
    derivative of a function. As we shall see, knowing just a little about f' tells us a
    lot about f. Extracting information about f from information about /f' requires
    some difficult work, however, and we shall begin with the one theorem which is
    really easy.
    
    This theorem is concerned with the maximum value of a function on an interval.
    Although we have used this term informally in Chapter 7, it is worthwhile to be
    precise, and also more general.
    
    Let f be a function and A a set of numbers contained in the domain of f.
    A point x in A is a maximum point for f on A if
    
    f(x) = f(y) for every y in A.
    
    The number f(x) itself is called the maximum value of f on A (and we also
    say that f "has its maximum value on A at x").
    
    Notice that the maximum value of f on A could be f(x) for several different x
    (Figure 1); in other words, a function f can have several different maximum points
    on A, although it can have at most one maximum value. Usually we shall be
    interested in the case where A is a closed interval [a,b]; if f is continuous, then
    Theorem 7-3 guarantees that f does indeed have a maximum value on [a, b].
    
    The definition of a minimum of f on A will be left to you. (One possible
    definition is the following: f has a minimum on A at x, if —f has a maximum
    on A at x.)
    
    We are now ready for a theorem which does not even depend upon the existence
    of least upper bounds.
    
    Let f be any function defined on (a, b). If x is a maximum (or a minimum) point
    for f on (a,b), and f is differentiable at x, then f'(x) = 0.
    
    (Notice that we do not assume differentiability, or even continuity, of f at other
    points.)

    Consider the case where f has a maximum at x. Figure 2 illustrates the simple idea
    behind the whole argument—secants drawn through points to the left of (x, f(x))
    have slopes > O, and secants drawn through points to the right of (x, f(x)) have
    slopes < 0. Analytically, this argument proceeds as follows.

    If h is any number such that x + A 1s in (a, b), then
    f(x) >= fa t+h),
    since f has a maximum on (a, b) at x. This means that
    f(x +h) — f(x) <9.
    Thus, if A > O we have

    By hypothesis, f is differentiable at x, so these two limits must be equal, in fact
    equal to f'(x). This means that
    
    f'(x) <0 and f(x) >0,
    
    from which it follows that f'(x) = 0.
    The case where f has a minimum at x is left to you (give a one-line proof). J
    
    Notice (Figure 3) that we cannot replace (a, b) by [a, b] in the statement of the
    theorem (unless we add to the hypothesis the condition that x 1s in (a, D).)
    
    Since f'(x) depends only on the values of f near x, it is almost obvious how to
    get a stronger version of Theorem |. We begin with a definition which 1s illustrated
    in Figure 4.

    Let $ f $ be a function, and $ A $ a set of numbers contained in the domain of $ f $.
    A point $ x $ in $ A $ is a local maximum [minimum] point for $ f $ on $ A $ if
    there is some $ \delta > 0 $ such that $ x $ is a maximum [minimum] point for $ f $ on
    $ A \cap (x - \delta, x + \delta) $.
    
    If $ x $ is a local maximum or minimum for $ f $ on $ (a, b) $ and $ f $ is differentiable at $ x $,
    then $ f'(x) = 0 $.
    
    You should see why this is an easy application of Theorem 1.

    The converse of Theorem 2 is definitely not true—it is possible for $ f'(x) $ to be 0
    even if $ x $ is not a local maximum or minimum point for $ f $. The simplest example
    is provided by the function $ f(x) = x^3 $; in this case $ f'(0) = 0 $, but $ f $ has no local
    maximum or minimum anywhere.
    
    Probably the most widespread misconceptions about calculus are concerned
    with the behavior of a function $ f $ near $ x $ when $ f'(x) = 0 $. The point made in
    the previous paragraph is so quickly forgotten by those who want the world to be
    simpler than it is, that we will repeat it: the converse of "Theorem 2 is not true—the
    condition $ f'(x) = 0 $ does not imply that $ x $ is a local maximum or minimum point
    of $ f $. Precisely for this reason, special terminology has been adopted to describe
    numbers $ x $ which satisfy the condition $ f'(x) = 0 $.
    
    A critical point of a function $ f $ is a number $ x $ such that
    $ f'(x) = 0 $.
    
    The number $ f(x) $ itself is called a critical value of $ f $.
  - |-
    The critical values of f, together with a few other numbers, turn out to be the
    ones which must be considered in order to find the maximum and minimum of a
    given function f. ‘To the uninitiated, finding the maximum and minimum value
    of a function represents one of the most intriguing aspects of calculus, and there
    is no denying that problems of this sort are fun (until you have done your first
    hundred or so).
    
    Let us consider first the problem of finding the maximum or minimum of f
    on a closed interval [a,b]. (Then, if f is continuous, we can at least be sure
    that a maximum and minimum value exist.) In order to locate the maximum and
    minimum of f three kinds of points must be considered:
    
    (1) The critical points of f in [a,b].
    (2) ‘The end points a and b.
    (3) Points x in [a,b] such that f is not differentiable at x.
    
    If x is a maximum point or a minimum point for f on [a, b], then x must be in one
    of the three classes listed above: for if x is not in the second or third group, then
    x is in (a,b) and f is differentiable at x; consequently f'(x) = 0, by Theorem 1,
    and this means that x is in the first group.
    
    If there are many points in these three categories, finding the maximum and
    minimum of f may still be a hopeless proposition, but when there are only a few
    critical points, and only a few points where f is not differentiable, the procedure is
    fairly straightforward: one simply finds f(x) for each x satisfying f'(x) = 0, and
    f(x) for each x such that f is not differentiable at x and, finally, f(a) and f(b).
    The biggest of these will be the maximum value of f, and the smallest will be the
    minimum. A simple example follows.

    II. Significance of the Derivative 191
    
    Suppose we wish to find the maximum and minimum value of the function 
    f(x) = x^2 on the interval [-2, 2].
  - |-
    The text provided appears to be a mix of mathematical expressions and some OCR errors. Here's the corrected version with proper formatting and spelling:
    
    ---
    
    $$ f(x) = xe^{-x} $$
    
    on the interval $[-1, 2]$. 'To begin with, we have
    
    $$ f'(x) = 3x^7 - 1 $$
    
    so $ f'(x) = 0 $ when $ 3x^2 - 1 = 0 $, that is, when
    
    $$ x = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} \text{ or } -\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} $$
    
    The numbers $ \frac{1}{3} $ and $ -\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} $ both lie in $[-1, 2]$, so the first group of candidates
    
    for the location of the maximum and minimum are
    
    (1) $ \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}, -\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} $
    
    The second group contains the end points of the interval,
    
    (2) $ -1, 2 $
    
    The third group is empty, since $ f $ is differentiable everywhere. The final step is to
    
    compute
    
    $$ f\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\right) = \left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\right) = 5\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -3\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} $$
    
    $$ f\left(-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\right) = \left(-\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\right) = -4\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 3\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} $$
    
    $$ f(-1) = 90 $$
    
    $$ f(2) = 6 $$
    
    Clearly the minimum value is $ -3\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} $, occurring at $ \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}} $, and the maximum value is 6, occurring at 2.
    
    This sort of procedure, if feasible, will always locate the maximum and minimum
    
    value of a continuous function on a closed interval. If the function we are dealing
    
    with is not continuous, however, or if we are seeking the maximum or minimum
    
    on an open interval or the whole line, then we cannot even be sure beforehand
    
    that the maximum and minimum values exist, so all the information obtained by
    
    this procedure may say nothing. Nevertheless, a little ingenuity will often reveal
    
    the nature of things. In Chapter 7 we solved just such a problem when we showed
    
    that if $ n $ is even, then the function
    
    $$ f(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 $$
    
    has a minimum value on the whole line. This proves that the minimum value must
    
    occur at some number $ x $ satisfying
    
    $$ 0 = f'(x) = nx^{n-1} + (n - 1)a_{n-1}x^{n-2} + \cdots + a_0 $$
  - |-
    If we can solve this equation, and compare the values of f(x) for such x, we can actually find the minimum of f. One more example may be helpful. Suppose we wish to find the maximum and minimum, if they exist, of the function
    
    $$
    f(x) = \frac{1}{1 - x^7}
    $$
    
    on the open interval (−1, 1). We have
    
    $$
    f'(x) = \frac{2x}{(1 - x^7)^2}
    $$
    
    so f'(x) = 0 only for x = 0. We can see immediately that for x close to 1 or −1 the values of f(x) become arbitrarily large, so f certainly does not have a maximum. This observation also makes it easy to show that f has a minimum at 0. We just note (Figure 5) that there will be numbers a and b, with
    
    $$
    -1 < a < 0 \text{ and } 0 < b < 1,
    $$
    
    such that f(x) > f(0) for
    
    $$
    -1 < x < a \text{ and } b < x < 1.
    $$
    
    This means that the minimum of f on [a,b] is the minimum of f on all of (−1,1). Now on [a,b] the minimum occurs either at 0 (the only place where f' = 0), or at a or b, and a and b have already been ruled out, so the minimum value is f(0) = 1.
    3
    
    In solving these problems we purposely did not draw the graphs of f(x) = x°−x and f(x) = 1/(1 − x7), but it is not cheating to draw the graph (Figure 6) as long as you do not rely solely on your picture to prove anything. As a matter of fact, we are now going to discuss a method of sketching the graph of a function that really gives enough information to be used in discussing maxima and minima—indeed we will be able to locate even local maxima and minima. This method involves consideration of the sign of f(x), and relies on some deep theorems.
  - |-
    The theorems about derivatives which have been proved so far, always yield
    information about f' in terms of information about f. This is true even of Theo-
    rem |, although this theorem can sometimes be used to determine certain informa-
    tion about f, namely, the location of maxima and minima. When the derivative
    was first introduced, we emphasized that f'(x) is not [f(x +h) — f(x)]/hA for any
    particular h, but only a limit of these numbers as h approaches 0; this fact becomes
    painfully relevant when one tries to extract information about f from information
    about f'. The simplest and most frustrating Wlustration of the difficulties encoun-
    tered is afforded by the following question: If f'(x) = O for all x, must f be a
    constant function? It 1s impossible to imagine how f could be anything else, and
    this conviction is strengthened by considering the physical interpretation—if the
    velocity of a particle is always O, surely the particle must be standing stl! Never-
    theless it is difficult even to begin a proof that only the constant functions satisfy
    f(x) = 0 for all x. The hypothesis f'(x) = 0 only means that

    and it is not at all obvious how one can use the information about the limit to
    derive information about the function.

    The fact that f is a constant function if f'(x) = 0 for all x, and many other facts
    of the same sort, can all be derived from a fundamental theorem, called the Mean
    Value Theorem, which states much stronger results. Figure 7 makes it plausible
    that if f is differentiable on [a, b], then there is some x in (a, b) such that
    
    f(b) — f(a)
    b—a
  - |-
    Geometrically this means that some tangent line is parallel to the line between
    (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)). The Mean Value Theorem asserts that this is true—there
    is some x in (a,b) such that f'(x), the instantaneous rate of change of f at x, is
    exactly equal to the average or "mean" change of f on [a, b], this average change
    being [ f(b) — f(a)]/[b — a]. (For example, if you travel 60 miles in one hour,
    then at some time you must have been traveling exactly 60 miles per hour.) This
    theorem is one of the most important theoretical tools of calculus—probably the
    deepest result about derivatives. From this statement you might conclude that the
    proof is difficult, but there you would be wrong—the hard theorems in this book
    have occurred long ago, in Chapter 7. It is true that if you try to prove the Mean
    Value Theorem yourself you will probably fail, but this is neither evidence that the
    theorem is hard, nor something to be ashamed of. The first proof of the theorem
    was an achievement, but today we can supply a proof which is quite simple. It
    helps to begin with a very special case.
    
    f(x) =
    
    If f is continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b), and f(a) = f(b), then
    there is a number x in (a, b) such that f'(x) = 0.
    
    It follows from the continuity of f on [a, b] that f has a maximum and a minimum
    value on [a, b].
    
    Suppose first that the maximum value occurs at a point x in (a,b). Then
    f'(x) = 0 by Theorem 1, and we are done (Figure 8).
    
    Suppose next that the minimum value of f occurs at some point x in (a, b).
    Then, again, f'(x) = 0 by Theorem 1 (Figure 9).

    Finally, suppose the maximum and minimum values both occur at the end points. Since f(a) = f(b), the maximum and minimum values of f are equal, so f is a constant function (Figure 10), and for a constant function we can choose any x in (a,b). J
    
    Notice that we really needed the hypothesis that f is differentiable everywhere on (a,b) in order to apply Theorem |. Without this assumption the theorem 1s false (Figure 11).
    
    You may wonder why a special name should be attached to a theorem as easily proved as Rolle's Theorem. The reason is, that although Rolle's Theorem is a special case of the Mean Value Theorem, it also yields a simple proof of the Mean Value Theorem. In order to prove the Mean Value Theorem we will apply Rolle's Theorem to the function which gives the length of the vertical segment shown in
    
    Figure 12; this is the difference between f(x), and the height at x of the line L between (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)). Since L is the graph of
    
    $$
    f(x) = f(a) + \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}(x - a)
    $$
    we want to look at
    $$
    f(x) - f(a) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}(x - a)
    $$
    As it turns out, the constant f(a) is irrelevant.
    
    If f is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), then there is a number x in (a, b) such that

    h(b) = f(b) - a > nm (x -a)  
    —a  
    = f(a).  
    
    Consequently, we may apply Rolle's Theorem to A and conclude that there is  
    some x in (a, b) such that

    Notice that the Mean Value Theorem still fits into the pattern exhibited by  
    previous theorems—information about f yields information about f'. ‘This infor-  
    mation is so strong, however, that we can now go in the other direction.  
    
    If f is defined on an interval and f'(x) = O for all x in the interval, then f is  
    constant on the interval.  
    
    Let a and b be any two points in the interval with a 4 b. Then there is some x in

    Naturally, Corollary 1 does not hold for functions defined on two or more in-  
    tervals (Figure 13).  
    
    If f and g are defined on the same interval, and f'(x) = g'(x) for all x in the  
    interval, then there is some number c such that f = g +c.

    For all x in the interval we have (f — g)'(x) = f'(x)—g'(x) = 0s0, by Corollary 1,
    there is a number c such that f —g=c. J
    
    The statement of the next corollary requires some terminology, which is illustrated in Figure 14.
    
    A function is increasing on an interval if f(a) < f(b) whenever a and b are
    two numbers in the interval with a < b. The function f is decreasing on
    an interval if f(a) > f(b) for all a and b in the interval with a < b. (We
    often say simply that f is increasing or decreasing, in which case the interval is
    understood to be the domain of f.)
    
    If f'(x) > O for all x in an interval, then f is increasing on the interval; if f'(x) < O
    for all x in the interval, then f is decreasing on the interval.
    
    Consider the case where f'(x) > 0. Let a and b be two points in the interval with
    a <b. Then there is some x in (a, b) with
    
    (f(b) — f(a)) = f'(x)(b—a)
    But f'(x) > 0 for all x in (a,b), so
    f(b) — f(a) > 0
    b—a
    
    Since b —a > O, it follows that f(b) > f(a).
    The proof when f'(x) < 0 for all x is left to you. J

    Notice that although the converses of Corollary 1 and Corollary 2 are true (and
    obvious), the converse of Corollary 3 is not true. If f is increasing, it is easy to
    see that f'(x) > O for all x, but the equality sign might hold for some x (consider
    f(x) =x^3?)
  - |-
    Corollary 3 provides enough information to get a good idea of the graph of  
    a function with a minimal amount of point plotting. Consider, once more, the  
    function f(x) = x³ — x. We have  
    
    f'(x) = 3x² - 1.  
    
    We have already noted that f'(x) = 0 for x = ∛(1/3) and x = -∛(1/3), and it is  
    also possible to determine the sign of f'(x) for all other x. Note that 3x² - 1 > 0  
    precisely when  
    
    3x² > 1  
    
    x² > 1/3  
    
    x > ∛(1/3) or x < -∛(1/3);  
    
    thus 3x² - 1 < 0 precisely when  
    
    -∛(1/3) < x < ∛(1/3).  
    
    Thus f is increasing for x < -∛(1/3), decreasing between -∛(1/3) and ∛(1/3),  
    and once again increasing for x > ∛(1/3). Combining this information with the  
    following facts  
    
    (1) f(-∛(1/3)) = 3∛(1/3),  
    f(∛(1/3)) = -3∛(1/3),  
    (2) f(x) = 0 for x = -1, 0, 1,  
    (3) f(x) gets large as x gets large, and large negative as x gets large negative,  
    
    it is possible to sketch a pretty respectable approximation to the graph (Figure 15).  
    
    By the way, notice that the intervals on which f increases and decreases could  
    have been found without even bothering to examine the sign of f'. For example,

    since f' is continuous, and vanishes only at ~/1/3 and J 1/3, we know that f'
    always has the same sign on the interval (—/1/3, J1/3 ). Since f (—/1/3 )>
    f (/1/3 ), it follows that f decreases on this interval. Similarly, f' always has the
    same sign on (/1/3, oo) and f(x) is large for large x, so f must be increasing on
    (/1/3, 00). Another point worth noting: If f' is continuous, then the sign of f'
    on the interval between two adjacent critical points can be determined simply by
    finding the sign of f'(x) for any one x in this interval.
    
    Our sketch of the graph of f(x) = x* — x contains sufficient information
    to allow us to say with confidence that —,/1/3 is a local maximum point, and that
    J/1/3 is a local minimum point. In fact, we can give a general scheme for decid-
    ing whether a critical point is a local maximum point, a local minimum point, or
    neither (Figure 16):
    
    (1) if f' > O in some interval to the left of x and f' < O in some interval to
    the right of x, then x is a local maximum point.
    
    (2) if f' < O in some interval to the left of x and f' > 0 in some interval to
    the right of x, then x is a local minimum point.
    
    (3) if f' has the same sign in some interval to the left of x as it has in some
    interval to the right, then x is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum
    point.
    
    (There is no point in memorizing these rules—you can always draw the pictures
    yourself.)
    
    The polynomial functions can all be analyzed in this way, and it is even possible
    to describe the general form of the graph of such functions. To begin, we need a

    then f has at most n "roots," 1.e., there are at most n numbers x such that  
    f(x) = 0. Although this is really an algebraic theorem, calculus can be used  
    to give an easy proof. Notice that if x; and x2 are roots of f (Figure 17), so that  
    x x x)\ f(x1) = f(x2) = 0, then by Rolle's Theorem there is a number x between x  
    and x2 such that f'(x) = 0. This means that if f has k different roots x; < x2 <  
    - < x,, then f' has at least k — | different roots: one between x; and x2, one  
    between x2 and x3, etc. It is now easy to prove by induction that a polynomial

    has at most n roots: The statement is surely true for n = 1, and if we assume that  
    it is true for n, then the polynomial

    could not have more than n + 1| roots, since if it did, g' would have more than n  
    roots.

    The derivative, being a polynomial function of degree n — 1, has at most
    n — 1 roots. Therefore f has at most n — 1 critical points. Of course, a criti-
    cal point is not necessarily a local maximum or minimum point, but at any rate,
    if a and b are adjacent critical points of f, then f' will remain either positive or
    negative on (a,b), since f' is continuous; consequently, f will be either increasing
    or decreasing on (a,b). ‘Thus f has at most n regions of decrease or increase.
    
    As a specific example, consider the function
    
    f(x) =x^3 — 2x^2.
    Since
    
    the critical points of f are —1, 0, and 1, and
    f(-1) =—1,
    f(0) = 0,
    f(1) = —1
    The behavior of f on the intervals between the critical points can be determined
    by one of the methods mentioned before. In particular, we could determine the
    sign of f' on these intervals simply by examining the formula for f'(x). On the
    
    other hand, from the three critical values alone we can see (figure 18) that f
    increases on (—1,0) and decreases on (0,1). To determine the sign of f' on
    (—oo, —1) and (1, ©) we can compute
    
    f'(-2) =4*(-2)^3 — 4*(-2)^2 = 24,
    f'(2)=4*(2)^3 — 4*(2)^2=24,
    
    and conclude that f is decreasing on (—oo, —1) and increasing on (1, 00). These
    conclusions also follow from the fact that f(x) is large for large x and for large
    negative x.
    
    We can already produce a good sketch of the graph; two other pieces of infor-
    mation provide the finishing touches (Figure 19). First, it is easy to determine that
  - |-
    f(x) = 0 for x = 0, +4/9: second, it is clear that f is even, f(x) = f(— x), so the
    graph is symmetric with respect to the vertical axis. The function f(x) = x? — x,
    already sketched in Figure 15, is odd, f(x) = —f(—~x), and is consequently sym-
    metric with respect to the origin. Half the work of graph sketching may be saved
    
    by noticing these things in the beginning.

    Several problems in this and succeeding chapters ask you to sketch the graphs
    of functions. In each case you should determine
    
    (1) the critical points of f,
    
    (2) the value of f at the critical points,
    
    (3) the sign of f' in the regions between critical points (if this 1s not already
    clear),
    
    (4) the numbers x such that f(x) = 0 (if possible),
    
    (5) the behavior of f(x) as x becomes large or large negative (if possible).
    
    Finally, bear in mind that a quick check, to see whether the function is odd or
    even, may save a lot of work.
    
    This sort of analysis, if performed with care, will usually reveal the basic shape
    of the graph, but sometimes there are special features which require a little more
    thought. It is impossible to anticipate all of these, but one piece of information 1s
    often very important. If f is not defined at certain points (for example, if f is a
    rational function whose denominator vanishes at some points), then the behavior
    of f near these points should be determined.
    
    For example, consider the function
    
    x*—2x+2
    
    f(x) = ———

    $(x — 1)?$
    $x(x - 2)$
    $(x — 1)?$"
    Thus
    (1) the critical points of f are 0, 2.
    Moreover,
    (2) $f(O) = —2$,
    $f (2) =2$.
    
    Because f is not defined on the whole interval (0, 2), the sign of $f'$ must be
    determined separately on the intervals $(O, 1)$ and $(1, 2)$, as well as on the intervals
    $(—oo, 0)$ and $(2, co)$. We can do this by picking particular points in each of these
    intervals, or simply by staring hard at the formula for $f'$. Either way we find that
    
    (3) $f(x)>0$ if $x <0$,
    $f(x) <0$ if $O<x <1$,
    $f(x) <0$ if $l<x <2$,
    $f(xy) >0O$ ff $2<x$.
    
    Finally, we must determine the behavior of $f(x)$ as $x$ becomes large or large
    negative, as well as when $x$ approaches $|$ (this information will also give us another
    way to determine the regions on which $f$ increases and decreases). ‘To examine
    the behavior as $x$ becomes large we write
    
    $\frac{x^2 — 2x + 2}{x - 1}$
    
    Clearly $f(x)$ is close to $x — 1$ (and slightly larger) when $x$ is large, and $f(x)$ is close
    to $x — |$ (but slightly smaller) when $x$ is large negative. ‘The behavior of $f$ near $|$ is also easy to determine; since
    
    $\lim_{x \to |} (x^2 — 2x + 2) = 140$,
    
    the fraction
    $$\frac{x^2 — 2x + 2}{x - 1}$$
    becomes large as $x$ approaches $|$ from above and large negative as $x$ approaches $|$ from below.
    
    All this information may seem a bit overwhelming, but there is only one way
    that it can be pieced together (Figure 20); be sure that you can account for each
    feature of the graph.
    
    When this sketch has been completed, we might note that it looks like the graph
    of an odd function shifted over $1$ unit, and the expression

    shows that this 1s indeed the case. However, this 1s one of those special features
    which should be investigated only after you have used the other information to get
    a good idea of the appearance of the graph.
    
    Although the location of local maxima and minima of a function 1s always re-
    vealed by a detailed sketch of its graph, it is usually unnecessary to do so much
    work. ‘There is a popular test for local maxima and minima which depends on the
    behavior of the function only at its critical points.
    
    Suppose f'(a) = 0. If f"(a) > 0, then f has a local minimum at a; if f"(a) < 0,
    
    then f has a local maximum at a.

    Suppose now that f"(a) > 0. Then f'(a + h)/h must be positive for sufficiently
    small h. ‘Therefore:
    
    f'(a +h) must be positive for sufficiently small h > 0
    and f'(a +h) must be negative for sufficiently small h < 0.
    
    This means (Corollary 3) that f is increasing in some interval to the right of a
    and f 1s decreasing in some interval to the left of a. Consequently, f has a local
    minimum at a.
    
    The proof for the case f(a) < 0 is similar. J
    
    Theorem 5 may be applied to the function f(x) = x? — x, which has already
    been considered. We have
    
    f(x) = 3x7 -1
    f" (x) = 6x.
    
    At the critical points, —/1/3 and /1/3, we have
  - |-
    f'(-1/3) = -6x^1/3 < 0,
    f'(1/3) = 6x^1/3 > 0.
    
    Consequently, -1/3 is a local maximum point and 1/3 is a local minimum
    point.
    
    Although Theorem 5 will be found quite useful for polynomial functions, for
    many functions the second derivative is so complicated that it is easier to consider
    the sign of the first derivative. Moreover, if a is a critical point of f it may happen
    that f''(a) = 0. In this case, Theorem 5 provides no information: it is possible
    that a is a local maximum point, a local minimum point, or neither, as shown
    
    (Figure 21) by the functions
    f(x)=−x^3, f(x)=x^3, f(x)=x^5:
    
    in each case f'(0) = f''(0) = 0, but 0 is a local maximum point for the first, a
    local minimum point for the second, and neither a local maximum nor minimum
    point for the third. This point will be pursued further in Part IV.
    
    It is interesting to note that Theorem 5 automatically proves a partial converse
    of itself.
    
    Suppose f'(a) exists. If f has a local minimum at a, then f''(a) > 0; if f has a
    local maximum at a, then f''(a) < 0.
    
    Suppose f has local minimum at a. If f''(a) < 0, then f would also have a
    local maximum at a, by Theorem 5. Thus f would be constant in some interval
    containing a, so that f(a) = 0, a contradiction. Thus we must have f''(a) = 0.
    
    The case of a local maximum is handled similarly. J

    The remainder of this chapter deals, not with graph sketching, or maxima and
    minima, but with three consequences of the Mean Value Theorem. The first is a
    simple, but very beautiful, theorem which plays an important role in Chapter 15,
    and which also sheds light on many examples which have occurred in previous
    chapters.
    
    Suppose that f is continuous at a, and that f'(x) exists for all x in some interval
    containing a, except perhaps for x = a. Suppose, moreover, that lim f'(x) exists.
    Xa
    
    Then f'(a) also exists, and
    
    f(a) = lim f(x).
    
    By definition,
    
    h) —
    h—0 h
    For sufficiently small h > O the function f will be continuous on [a,a +h] and
    
    differentiable on (a,a +h) (a similar assertion holds for sufficiently small h < 0).
    By the Mean Value Theorem there is a number c in (a, a + h) such that
    
    f(a+h) — f(a)
    h
    
    Now c approaches a as h approaches 0, because c is in (a,a +h); since
    lim f'(x) exists, it follows that
    Xa
    
    = f'(c).
    
    h—0 h
    
    = lim f'(c) = lim f'(x).
    
    (It is a good idea to supply a rigorous ε-δ argument for this final step, which we
    have treated somewhat informally.) §
    
    Even if f is an everywhere differentiable function, it is still possible for f' to be
    discontinuous. This happens, for example, if
    
    1
    x*sin(1/x), x ≠ 0
    f(x) =
    0, x = 0.
    
    According to Theorem 7, however, the graph of f' can never exhibit a discontinuity
    of the type shown in Figure 22. Problem 61 outlines the proof of another
    beautiful theorem which gives further information about the function f', and Prob-
    lem 62 uses this result to strengthen Theorem 7.
    
    The next theorem, a generalization of the Mean Value Theorem, is of interest
    mainly because of its applications.
  - |-
    THEOREM 8 (THE CAUCHY MEAN VALUE THEOREM)
    
    PROOF
    
    THEOREM 9 (L'HÔPITAL'S RULE)
    
    If f and g are continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a, b), then there is a
    number x in (a, b) such that
    
    [ f(b) — f(a)] = [g(b) — g(a)] f'(x).
    (If g(b) ≠ g(a), and g'(x) ≠ 0, this equation can be written
    
    [ f(b)—f(a)] = [g(b)—g(a)] [f'(x)/g'(x)]
    Notice that if g(x) = x for all x, then g'(x) = 1, and we obtain the Mean Value
    
    Theorem. On the other hand, applying the Mean Value Theorem to f and g
    separately, we find that there are x and y in (a, b) with
    
    [ f(b)—f(a)] = [g(b)—g(a)] [f'(x)/g'(y)]
    but there is no guarantee that the x and y found in this way will be equal. These
    
    remarks may suggest that the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem will be quite difficult
    to prove, but actually the simplest of tricks suffices.)
    
    Let
    h(x) = f(x)[g(b) — g(a) — g(x)] [f(b) — f(a)].
    
    Then h is continuous on [a, b], differentiable on (a, b), and
    
    h(a) = f(a)g(b) — g(a) f(b) = h(b).
    
    It follows from Rolle's Theorem that h'(x) = 0 for some x in (a, b), which means
    that
    
    0= f'(x)[g(b) — g(a)] — g(x) [f(b) — f(a)]. 1
    
    The Cauchy Mean Value Theorem is the basic tool needed to prove a theorem
    which facilitates evaluation of limits of the form
    
    lim f(x)/g(x)
    
    when
    lim f(x)=0 and lim g(x) =0.
  - |-
    In this case, ‘Theorem 5-2 is of no use. Every derivative 1s a limit of this form, and
    computing derivatives frequently requires a great deal of work. If some derivatives
    are known, however, many limits of this form can now be evaluated easily.
    
    Suppose that
    lim f(x) =O and_= im g(x) =),
    
    and suppose also that lim f'(x)/g'(x) exists. Then lim f(x)/g(x) exists, and
    
    f(x) : f'(x)
    
    lim im —
    xa g(x) = xa g'(x)
    
    (Notice that Theorem 7 1s a special case.)
    
    PROOF
    
    11. Significance of the Derivative 205
    
    The hypothesis that lim f'(x)/g'(x) exists contains two implicit assumptions:
    Xa—a
    
    (1) there is an interval (a —5,a+ 4) such that f'(x) and g'(x) exist for all x in
    (a —5,a +54) except, perhaps, for x = a,
    
    (2) in this interval g'(x) ≠ 0 with, once again, the possible exception
    of x =a.
    
    On the other hand, f and g are not even assumed to be defined at a. If we define
    f(a) = g(a) = 0 (changing the previous values of f(a) and g(a), if necessary),
    then f and g are continuous at a. If a < x < a+, then the Mean Value
    Theorem and the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem apply to f and g on the interval
    [a,x] (and a similar statement holds for a — 6 < x <a). First applying the Mean
    Value Theorem to g, we see that g(x) ≠ 0, for if g(x) = 0 there would be some x
    in (a, x) with g'(x;) = 0, contradicting (2). Now applying the Cauchy Mean Value
    Theorem to f and g, we see that there is a number a@, 1n (a, x) such that
    
    [ f(x) — O]g'(ax) = [g(x) — 0] f'(ax)
  - |-
    Or  
    f(x) = f(ax)  
    g(x) = g(ax)  
    
    Now a, approaches a as x approaches a, because a, is in (a,x); since we are  
    assuming that lim f'(y)/g'(y) exists, it follows that  
    you

    im = lim = lim

    It is easy to find a function $ f $ such that $ |f| $ is differentiable but $ f $ is not. For example, we can choose $ f(x) = 1 $ for $ x $ rational and $ f(x) = -1 $ for $ x $ irrational. In this example $ f $ is not even continuous, nor is this a mere coincidence: Prove that if $ |f| $ is differentiable at $ a $, and $ f $ is continuous at $ a $, then $ f $ is also differentiable at $ a $. Hint: It suffices to consider only a with $ f(a) = 0 $. Why? In this case, what must $ |f|'(a) $ be?

    (b) Prove that if $ y \neq 0 $ and $ n $ is odd, then $ x^n + y^n = (x + y)^n $ only if $ x = 0 $ or $ x = -y $.
    
    Suppose that $ f(0) = 0 $ and $ f $ is increasing. Prove that the function $ g(x) = \frac{f(x)}{x} $ is increasing on $(0, \infty)$. Hint: Obviously you should look at $ g'(x) $. Prove that it is positive by applying the Mean Value Theorem to $ f $ on the right interval (it will help to remember that the hypothesis $ f(0) = 0 $ is essential, as shown by the function $ f(x) = 1 + x^7 $).
    
    Use derivatives to prove that if $ n > 1 $, then
    $$
    (1 + x)^n \leq 1 + nx \quad \text{for} \quad -1 < x < \infty \quad \text{and} \quad 0 < x

    (notice that equality holds for $ x = 0 $).
    
    Let $ f(x) = x^4 \sin^2(1/x) $ for $ x \neq 0 $, and let $ f(0) = 0 $ (Figure 33).
    
    (a) Prove that $ 0 $ is a local minimum point for $ f $.
    
    (b) Prove that $ f'(0) = f''(0) = 0 $.
    
    This function thus provides another example to show that Theorem 6 cannot be improved. It also illustrates a subtlety about maxima and minima that often goes unnoticed: a function may not be increasing in any interval to the right of a local minimum point, nor decreasing in any interval to the left.

    $$ \frac{(\sin y)^5}{y^2} = \cos y $$

    This would imply that for sufficiently small $ x > 0 $, the expression  
    $$ 2x \sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) < -1 $$  
    and hence that $ f'(x) < 0 $ for such $ x $. Therefore, for $ a > 1 $,  
    there are points near 0 where $ f'(x) < 0 $. This shows that $ f $ is not

    (a) If f is a constant function, then every point is a local maximum point for f. It is quite possible for this to happen even if f is not a constant function: for example, if f(x) = 0 for x < 0 and f(x) = 1 for x > 0. But prove, using Problem 8-4, that if f is continuous on [a, b] and every point of [a,b] is a local maximum point, then f is a constant function. The same result holds, of course, if every point of [a,b] is a local minimum point.

    Suppose now that every point is either a local maximum or a local minimum point for the continuous function $ f $ (but we don't preclude the possibility that some points are local maxima while others are local minima). Prove that $ f $ is constant, as follows. Suppose that $ f(a_0) < f(b_0) $. We can assume that $ f(a_g) < f(x) < f(b_0) $ for $ a_g < x < b_0 $. (Why?) Using Theorem 1 of the Appendix to Chapter 8, partition $ [a_0, b_0] $ into intervals on which $ \sup f - \inf f < (f(b_0) - f(a_0))/2 $; also choose the lengths of these intervals to be less than $ (b_0 - a_0)/2 $. Then there is one such interval $ [a_i, b_i] $ with $ a_g < a_i < b_i < b_0 $ and $ f(a_i) < f(b_i) $. (Why?) Continue inductively and use the Nested Interval Theorem (Problem 8-14) to find a point $ x $ that cannot be a local maximum or minimum.
    
    A point $ x $ is called a strict maximum point for $ f $ on $ A $ if $ f(x) > f(y) $ for all $ y \in A $ with $ y \ne x $ (compare with the definition of an ordinary maximum point). A local strict maximum point is defined in the obvious way. Find all local strict maximum points of the function
    
    $$
    f(x) = 
    \begin{cases} 
    Q & \text{if } x \text{ is irrational}, \\
    \frac{p}{q} & \text{if } x = \frac{p}{q} \text{ in lowest terms}.
    \end{cases}
    $$
    
    It seems quite unlikely that a function can have a local strict maximum at every point (although the above example might give one pause for thought). Prove this as follows.

    APPENDIX. CONVEXITY AND CONCAVITY
    
    Although the graph of a function can be sketched quite accurately on the basis
    of the information provided by the derivative, some subtle aspects of the graph are
    revealed only by examining the second derivative. These details were purposely
    omitted previously because graph sketching is complicated enough without wor-
    rying about them, and the additional information obtained is often not worth the
    effort. Also, correct proofs of the relevant facts are sufficiently difficult to be placed
    in an appendix. Despite these discouraging remarks, the information presented
    here is well worth assimilating, because the notions of convexity and concavity are
    far more important than as mere aids to graph sketching. Moreover, the proofs
    have a pleasantly geometric flavor not often found in calculus theorems. Indeed,
    the basic definition 1s geometric in nature (see Figure 1).
    
    A function f is convex on an interval, if for all a and b in the interval, the line
    
    segment joining (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) lies above the graph of f.
    
    The geometric condition appearing in this definition can be expressed in an
    analytic way that is sometimes more useful in proofs. The straight line between
    
    (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) 1s the graph of the function g defined by
    
    _ f(b) — fla)
    = (
    b—-—a
    
    g(x) x —a)+ f(a).

    This line lies above the graph of f at x if g(x) > f(x), that is, if

    A function f is convex on an interval if for a, x, and b in the interval with
    
    a<x <b we have
    f(x) — fla) - f(b) — fla)

    we obtain the definition of a concave function (Figure 2). It is not hard to see that
    the concave functions are precisely the ones of the form —f, where f is convex.
    For this reason, the next three theorems about convex functions have immediate
    corollaries about concave functions, so simple that we will not even bother to
    state them.
    
    Figure 3 shows some tangent lines of a convex function. ‘Two things seem to be
    true:
    
    (1) The graph of f lies above the tangent line at (a, f(a)) except at the point
    (a, f(a)) itself (this point is called the point of contact of the tangent line).
    
    (2) If a < b, then the slope of the tangent line at (a, f(a)) is less than the slope
    of the tangent line at (b, f(b)); that is, f' is increasing,
    
    As a matter of fact these observations are true, and the proofs are not difficult.
    
    FIGURE 3
  - |-
    Let f be convex. If f is differentiable at a, then the graph of f lies above  
    the tangent line through (a, f(a)), except at (a, f(a)) itself. If a < b and f is  
    differentiable at a and b, then f'(a) < f'(b).
    
    If 0 < hy < hy, then as Figure 4 indicates,
    
    $$
    \frac{f(a+hy) - f(a)}{hy} - \frac{f(a+hy') - f(a)}{hy'}
    $$
    
    (1)
    
    A nonpictorial proof can be derived immediately from Definition 2 applied to  
    a < a + h < a + hy. Inequality (1) shows that the values of
    
    $$
    \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}
    $$
    
    decrease as h > 0. Consequently,
    
    $$
    \frac{f(a +h) - f(a)}{h}
    $$
    
    (in fact f'(a) is the greatest lower bound of all these numbers). But this means that  
    for h > 0 the secant line through (a, f(a)) and (a +h, f(a +h)) has larger slope  
    than the tangent line, which implies that (a +h, f(a + h)) lies above the tangent  
    line (an analytic translation of this argument is easily supplied).
    
    For negative h there is a similar situation (Figure 5): if hz < h < 0, then
    
    $$
    \frac{f(a+hz) - f(a)}{hz} - \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}
    $$
    
    This shows that the slope of the tangent line is greater than
    
    $$
    \frac{f(a +h) - f(a)}{h}
    $$
    
    (in fact f'(a) is the least upper bound of all these numbers), so that f(a + h) lies  
    above the tangent line if h < 0. This proves the first part of the theorem.
    
    for h > 0
    
    $$
    f'(a) < \frac{f(a +h) - f(a)}{h}
    $$
    
    for h < 0
    
    $$
    f'(a) > \frac{f(a +h) - f(a)}{h}
    $$

    Theorem | has two converses. Here the proofs will be a little more difficult.
    We begin with a lemma that plays the same role in the next theorem that Rolle's
    Theorem plays in the proof of the Mean Value Theorem. It states that if f'
    is increasing, then the graph of f lies below any secant line which happens to be
    
    horizontal.
    
    Suppose f is differentiable and f" is increasing. If a < b and f(a) = f(b), then
    
    f(x) < f(a) = f(b) for a <x <b.
    
    Suppose that f(x) > f(a) = f(b) for some x in (a,b). Then the maximum of
    f on [a,b] occurs at some point xo in (a, b) with f(xo) = f(a) and, of course,
    f'(xo) = O (Figure 7). On the other hand, applying the Mean Value Theorem to
    
    the interval [a, xo], we find that there 1s x; with a < x) < xg and
    
    f(xo) — f(a) S 0

    f(x) =

    We now attack the general case by the same sort of algebraic machinations that
    we used in the proof of the Mean Value Theorem.
    
    If f is differentiable and f' 1s increasing, then f is convex.
  - |-
    Let a < b. Define g by  
    $$ f(b) - f(a) $$  
    $$ \frac{x - a}{b - a} $$  
    
    It is easy to see that g' is also increasing; moreover, g(a) = g(b) = f(a). Applying  
    the lemma to g we conclude that  
    
    $$ g(x) = f(x) - \frac{x - a}{b - a} $$  
    
    $$ g(x) < f(a) \text{ if } a < x < b. $$  
    
    In other words, if a < x < b, then  
    
    $$ \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} $$  
    
    $$ f(x) - (x - a) < f(a) $$  
    
    or  
    
    $$ f(x) - f(a) - \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{x - a} $$  
    
    $$ \frac{x - a}{b - a} $$  
    
    Hence f is convex. J  
    
    If f is differentiable and the graph of f lies above each tangent line except at the  
    point of contact, then f is convex.  
    
    Let a < b. It is clear from Figure 8 that if (b, f(b)) lies above the tangent line at  
    (a, f(a)), and (a, f(a)) lies above the tangent line at (b, f(b)), then the slope of  
    the tangent line at (b, f(b)) must be larger than the slope of the tangent line at  
    (a, f(a)). The following argument just says this with equations.  
    
    Since the tangent line at (a, f(a)) is the graph of the function  
    $$ g(x) = f'(a)(x - a) + f(a), $$  
    and since (b, f(b)) lies above the tangent line, we have  
    (1) $$ f(b) > f'(a)(b - a) + f(a). $$  
    Similarly, since the tangent line at (b, f(b)) is the graph of  
    $$ h(x) = f'(b)(x - b) + f(b), $$  
    and (a, f(a)) lies above the tangent line at (b, f(b)), we have  
    (2) $$ f(a) > f'(b)(a - b) + f(b). $$  
    It follows from (1) and (2) that $$ f'(a) < f'(b). $$  
    
    It now follows from Theorem 2 that f is convex. J  
    
    If a function f has a reasonable second derivative, the information given in these  
    theorems can be used to discover the regions in which f is convex or concave.

    Consider, for example, the function
    
    $$
    f(x) = \frac{1}{(1 + x^7)^4}
    $$
    
    Thus $ f'(x) = 0 $ only for $ x = 0 $, and $ f(0) = 1 $, while
    
    $ f(x) > 0 $ if $ x < 0 $,
    $ f(x) < 0 $ if $ x > 0 $.
    
    Moreover,
    
    $ f(x) > 0 $ for all $ x $,
    $ f(x) > 0 $ as $ x \to \infty $ or $ -\infty $,
    $ f $ is even.
    
    FIGURE 9
    
    The graph of $ f $ therefore looks something like Figure 9. We now compute
    
    $$
    \frac{(1 + x^7)^2(—2) + 2x - [2(1 + x) - 2x]}{(1 + x^7)^4}
    $$
    
    $$
    = \frac{2(3x^2 — 1)}{(1 + x^2)^3}
    $$
    
    It is not hard to determine the sign of $ f''(x) $. Note first that $ f''(x) = 0 $ only when
    $ x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} $. Since $ f'' $ is clearly continuous, it must keep the same sign
    
    on each of the sets
    
    $$
    (-\infty, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}), \quad (-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}), \quad (\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \infty).
    $$
    
    Since we easily compute, for example, that
    
    $ f''(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) = 5 > 0 $,
    $ f''(0) = -\frac{2}{3} < 0 $,
    $ f''(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) = 4 > 0 $,
    
    we conclude that
    
    $$
    f'' > 0 \text{ on } (-\infty, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) \text{ and } (\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \infty),
    $$
    $$
    f'' < 0 \text{ on } (-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}).
    $$
    
    Since $ f'' > 0 $ means $ f' $ is increasing, it follows from Theorem 2 that $ f $ is convex on
    
    $$
    (-\infty, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) \text{ and } (\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \infty),
    $$
    while on $ (-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) $, $ f $ is concave (Figure 10).
    
    $$
    f \text{ is convex } \quad — \quad f \text{ is concave } \quad — \quad f \text{ is convex}

    $$

    FIGURE 10
    
    Notice that at $ (\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, x) $ the tangent line lies below the part of the graph to the
  - |-
    Right, since f is convex on (1/3, ∞), and above the part of the graph to the left,
    since f is concave on (−1/3, 1/3); thus the tangent line crosses the graph. In
    
    general, a number a is called an inflection point of f if the tangent line to the
    
    graph of f at (a, f(a)) crosses the graph; thus ±1/3 are inflection
    points of f(x) = 1/(1 + x^2). Note that the condition f'(a) = 0 does not ensure
    that a is an inflection point of f; for example, if f(x) = x^4, then f''(0) = 0, but
    f is convex, so the tangent line at (0, 0) certainly doesn't cross the graph of f. In
    order to conclude that a is an inflection point of a function f, we need to know
    that f'' has different signs to the left and right of a.
    
    This example illustrates the procedure which may be used to analyze any func-
    tion f. After the graph has been sketched, using the information provided by f',
    the zeros of f'' are computed and the sign of f'' is determined on the intervals
    between consecutive zeros. On intervals where f'' > 0 the function is convex;
    on intervals where f'' < 0 the function is concave. Knowledge of the regions of
    convexity and concavity of f can often prevent absurd misinterpretation of other
    data about f. Several functions, which can be analyzed in this way, are given in
    the problems, which also contain some theoretical questions.

    If f is differentiable on an interval and intersects each of its tangent lines just once, then f is either convex or concave on that interval.
    
    There are two parts to the proof.
    
    (1) First we claim that no straight line can intersect the graph of f in three different points. Suppose, on the contrary, that some straight line did intersect the graph of f at (a, f(a)), (b, f(b)) and (c, f(c)), with a < b < c (Figure 11). Then we would have
    
    $$
    \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = \frac{f(c) - f(a)}{c - a}
    $$
    
    (1)
    
    Consider the function
    
    $$
    g(x) = \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \quad \text{for } x \in [b,c].
    $$
    
    Equation (1) says that $ g(b) = g(c) $. So by Rolle's Theorem, there is some number $ x $ in (b,c) where 0 = g'(x), and thus
    
    $$
    0 = \frac{(x - a)f'(x) - (f(x) - f(a))}{(x - a)^2}
    $$
    
    or
    
    $$
    f(x) - f(a) = (x - a)f'(x)
    $$
    
    But this says (Figure 12) that the tangent line at (x, f(x)) passes through (a, f(a)), contradicting the hypotheses.
    
    (2) Suppose that $ a_1 < b_1 < c_1 $ and $ a_2 < b_2 < c_2 $; are points in the interval. Let
    
    $$
    x_1 = (1 - t)a_1 + ta_2, \quad y_1 = (1 - t)b_1 + tb_2, \quad z_1 = (1 - t)c_1 + tc_2
    $$
    
    for $ 0 < t < 1 $. Then $ x_1 = a_1 $ and $ x_2 = a_2 $, and (Problem 4-2) the points $ x_1 $ all lie between $ a_1 $ and $ a_2 $, with analogous statements for $ y_1 $ and $ z_1 $. Moreover,
    
    $$
    x < y < 2 \quad \text{for } 0 < t < 1.
    $$
    
    Now consider the function
    
    $$
    g(t) = \frac{y_1 - x_1}{z_1 - x_1}
    $$
    
    By step (1), $ g(t) \neq 0 $ for all $ t $ in [0,1]. So either $ g(t) > 0 $ for all $ t $ in [0,1] or $ g(t) < 0 $ for all $ t $ in [0,1]. Thus, either f is convex or f is concave. J

    (a) Prove that if f and g are convex and f is increasing, then f o g is convex.
    (It will be easiest to use Problem 3.)
    
    (b) Give an example where g o f is not convex.
    
    (c) Suppose that f and g are twice differentiable. Give another proof of the
    result of part (a) by considering second derivatives.
    
    (a) Suppose that f is differentiable and convex on an interval. Show that
    either f is increasing, or else f is decreasing, or else there is a number c
    such that f is decreasing to the left of c and increasing to the right of c.
    
    (b) Use this fact to give another proof of the result in Problem 4(a) when f
    and g are (one-time) differentiable. (You will have to be a little careful
    when comparing f'(g(x)) and f"(g(y)) for x < y.)
    
    (c) Prove the result in part (a) without assuming f differentiable. You will
    have to keep track of several different cases, but no particularly clever
    ideas are needed. Begin by showing that if a < b and f(a) < f(b), then
    f is increasing to the right of b; and if f(a) > f(b), then f is decreasing
    to the left of a.

    Let f be a twice-differentiable function with the following properties:
    f(x) > O for x > O, and f is decreasing, and f'(O) = 0. Prove that
    f(x) = 0 for some x > 0 (so that in reasonable cases f will have an inflec-
    tion point at x—an example is given by f(x) = 1/(1 +x²)). Every hypothesis
    in this theorem is essential, as shown by f(x) = 1 — x⁷, which is not positive
    for all x; by f(x) = x², which is not decreasing; and by f(x) = 1/(x + 1),
    which does not satisfy f'(0) = 0. Hint: Choose x9 > O with f'(x9) < 0. We
    cannot have f'(y) < f'(xo) for all y > x9. Why not? So f(x) > f'(xo) for
    some x1 > x9. Consider f' on [0, x1].
    
    (a) Prove that if f is convex, then f([x + y]/2) < [f(x) + f(y)]/2.
    
    (b) Suppose that f satisfies this condition. Show that f(kx + (1 —k)y) <
    kf (x) + (1 — k) f(y) whenever k is a rational number, between 0 and I,
    of the form m/2ⁿ. Hint: Part (a) is the special case n = 1. Use induction,
    employing part (a) at each step.
    
    (c) Suppose that f satisfies the condition in part (a) and f is continuous.
    Show that f is convex.

    denoted by f(a), and the left-hand derivative is denoted by f' (a). The
    proof of Theorem | actually shows that f(a) and f' (a) always exist if
    f is convex on some open interval containing a. Check this assertion,
    and also show that f, and f' are increasing, and that f(a) < f; (a).
    Conversely, suppose that f is convex on [a, b] and g is convex on [b, c],
    with f(b) = g(b) and f'(b) < g'(b) (Figure 13(a)). If we define h
    on [a,c] to be f on [a,b] and g on [b,c], show that h is convex on

    We now have at our disposal quite powerful methods for investigating functions;
    what we lack is an adequate supply of functions to which these methods may
    be applied. We have studied various ways of forming new functions from old—
    addition, multiplication, division, and composition—but using these alone, we can
    produce only the rational functions (even the sine function, although frequently
    used for examples, has never been defined). In the next few chapters we will
    begin to construct new functions in quite sophisticated ways, but there is one
    important method which will practically double the usefulness of any other method
    we discover.
    
    If we recall that a function is a collection of pairs of numbers, we might hit upon
    the bright idea of simply reversing all the pairs. Thus from the function
    
    f ={(1, 2), (3,4), (6, 9), (13, 8) },
    
    we obtain
    
    While f(1) = 2 and f(3) = 4, we have g(2) = 1 and g(4) =3.
    Unfortunately, this bright idea does not always work. If
    
    f ={(1, 2), (3,4), (3,9), (13, 4) },
    
    then the collection
    
    { (2, 1), (4, 3), (9, 5), (4, 13)}
    
    is not a function at all, since it contains both (4, 3) and (4, 13). It is clear where
    the trouble is: f(3) = f(13), even though 3 ≠ 13. This is the only sort of thing
    that can go wrong, and it is worthwhile giving a name to the functions for which
    this does not happen.
    
    A function f is one-one (read "one-to-one") if f(a) ≠ f(b) whenever a ≠ b.
    
    The identity function I is obviously one-one, and so is the following modification:
    
    x, x ≠ 3,5
    g(x) = { 3, x =5
    5, x=3.
    
    The function f(x) = x² is not one-one, since f(—1) = f(1), but if we define
    g(x) = x³, x >0

    (and leave g undefined for x < 0), then g is one-one, because g is increasing (since
    g'(x) = 2x > 0, for x > 0). This observation is easily generalized: If n is a natural
    number and
    
    f(x) =x", x >0,
    then f is one-one. If n is odd, one can do better: the function
    f(x) = x" for all x
    
    is one-one (since f'(x) =nx"—! > 0, for all x 4 0).
    
    It is particularly easy to decide from the graph of f whether f is one-one: the
    condition f(a) # f(b) for a 4 b means that no horizontal line intersects the graph
    of f twice (Figure 1).

    If we reverse all the pairs in (a not necessarily one-one function) f we obtain, in
    any case, some collection of pairs. It is popular to abstain from this procedure un-
    less f is one-one, but there is no particular reason to do so—instead of a definition
    with restrictive conditions we obtain a definition and a theorem.
    
    For any function f, the inverse of f, denoted by f~}, is the set of all pairs
    (a,b) for which the pair (b, a) is in f.
    
    f—' is a function if and only if f is one-one.
    
    Suppose first that f is one-one. Let (a, b) and (a,c) be two pairs in f~'. Then
    (b,a) and (c,a) are in f, soa = f(b) and a = f(c); since f 1s one-one this
    implies that b = c. Thus f~! is a function.
    
    Conversely, suppose that f~! is a function. If f(b) = f(c), then f contains
    the pairs (b, f(b)) and (c, f(c)) = (c, f(b)), so (f(b), b) and (f(b), c) are in fo!.
  - |-
    Since f~! is a function this implies that b = c. Thus f is one-one. J

    The graphs of f and f~! are so closely related that it is possible to use the
    graph of f to visualize the graph of f~!. Since the graph of f~! consists of all
    pairs (a, b) with (b, a) in the graph of f, one obtains the graph of f~! from the
    graph of f by interchanging the horizontal and vertical axes. If f has the graph

    reflect the graph of f through this line (Figure 5).

    Reflecting through the diagonal twice will clearly leave us right back where we started; this means that (f~!)~! = f, which is also clear from the definition. In conjunction with Theorem |, this equation has a significant consequence: if f is a one-one function, then the function f~! is also one-one (since (f~!)~! is a function).
    
    There are a few other simple manipulations with inverse functions of which you should be aware. Since (a, b) is in f precisely when (5, a) 1s in f —l it follows that
    
    b= f(a) means the same as a= f7'(b).
    
    Thus f~!(b) is the (unique) number a such that f(a) = b; for example, if f(x) = x?, then f~!(b) is the unique number a such that a' = b, and this number is, by definition, Vb.
    
    The fact that f~!(x) is the number y such that f(y) = x can be restated in a much more compact form:
    
    ff '@)) =x, for all x in the domain of f7!.
    
    Moreover,
    
    f '(f(x)) = X, for all x in the domain of f;
    
    this follows from the previous equation upon replacing f by f~!. These two important equations can be written
    
    fofl=l,
    fllofsl
    
    (except that the right side will have a bigger domain if the domain of f or f7! is not all of R).

    THEOREM 2
    
    PROOF
    
    Since many standard functions will be defined as the inverses of other functions,
    it is quite important that we be able to tell which functions are one-one. We have
    already hinted which class of functions are most easily dealt with—increasing and
    decreasing functions are obviously one-one. Moreover, if f is increasing, then f~!
    is also increasing, and if f is decreasing, then f~! is decreasing (the proof is left
    to you). In addition, f is increasing if and only if —f is decreasing, a very useful
    fact to remember.
  - |-
    It is certainly not true that every one-one function is either increasing or decreas-
    ing. One example has already been mentioned, and is now graphed in Figure 6:
    
    x, x #3,5
    g(x)= 43, x=5
    5, x=3.
    
    Figure 7 shows that there are even continuous one-one functions which are neither
    increasing nor decreasing. But if you try drawing a few pictures you will soon
    suspect that every one-one continuous function defined on an interval is either
    increasing or decreasing.
    
    If f is continuous and one-one on an interval, then f 1s either increasing or
    decreasing on that interval.
    
    The proof proceeds in three easy steps:
    
    (1) If a < b <c are three points in the interval, then
    
    either (1) f(a) < f(b) < fc)
    or ii) fla) > f(b) > flo).
    
    Suppose, for example, that f(a) < f(c). If we had f(b) < f(a) (Figure 8), then
    the Intermediate Value Theorem applied to the interval [b, c] would give an x with

    b<x <cand f(x) = f(a), contradicting the fact that f is one-one on [a,c].
    Similarly, f(b) > f(c) would lead to a contradiction, so f(a) < f(b) < f(c).
    
    Naturally, the same sort of argument works for the case f(a) > f(c).
    
    (2) If a < b <c <d are four points in the interval, then
    
    either (1) f(a) < f(b) < fc) < fd)
    or (11) f(a) > f(b) > flc) > f(d).
    
    For we can apply (1) toa < b <c and then tob<c <d.

    (3) 'Take any a < b in the interval, and suppose that f(a) < f(b). Then f is increasing: For if c and d are any two points, we can apply (2) to the collection {a, b, c, d} (after arranging them in increasing order).'
    
    Henceforth we shall be concerned almost exclusively with continuous increasing or decreasing functions which are defined on an interval. If f is such a function, it is possible to say quite precisely what the domain of f! will be like.
    
    Suppose first that f is a continuous increasing function on the closed interval [a, b]. Then, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, f takes on every value between f(a) and f(b). Therefore, the domain of f! is the closed interval [f(a), f(b)].
    Similarly, if f is continuous and decreasing on [a, b], then the domain of f! is [f(b), f(a)].
    
    If f is a continuous increasing function on an open interval (a, b) the analysis becomes a bit more difficult. To begin with, let us choose some point c in (a, b). We will first decide which values > f(c) are taken on by f. One possibility is that f takes on arbitrarily large values (Figure 9). In this case f takes on all values > f(c), by the Intermediate Value Theorem. If, on the other hand, f does not take on arbitrarily large values, then A = {f(x): c < x < b} is bounded above, so A has a least upper bound α (Figure 10). Now suppose y is any number with f(c) < y < α. Then f takes on some value f(x) > y (because α is the least upper bound of A). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, f actually takes on the value y. Notice that f cannot take on the value α itself; for if α = f(x) for a < x < b and we choose t with x < t < b, then f(t) > α, which is impossible.
  - |-
    Precisely the same arguments work for values less than f(c): either f takes on all values less than f(c) or there is a number f < f(c) such that f takes on all values between B and f(c), but not B itself.
    
    This entire argument can be repeated if f is decreasing, and if the domain of f is R or (a,c) or (—oo, a). Summarizing: if f is a continuous increasing, or decreasing, function whose domain is an interval having one of the forms (a, b), (—oo, b), (a, oo), or R, then the domain of f^{-1} is also an interval which has one of these four forms, and we can easily fit the remaining types of intervals, (a, b], [a,b], (—oo, b], and [a, oo), into this discussion also.
    
    Now that we have completed this preliminary analysis of continuous one-one functions, it is possible to begin asking which important properties of a one-one function are inherited by its inverse. For continuity there is no problem.
    
    If f is continuous and one-one on an interval, then f^{-1} is also continuous.
    
    We know by Theorem 2 that f is either increasing or decreasing. We might as well assume that f is increasing, since we can then take care of the other case by applying the usual trick of considering —f. We might as well assume our interval is open, since it is easy to see that a continuous increasing or decreasing function on any interval can be extended to one on a larger open interval.
    
    We must show that
    
    $$
    \lim_{x \to a} f^{-1}(x) = f^{-1}(a)
    $$
    
    for each b in the domain of f^{-1}. Such a number b is of the form f(a) for some a in the domain of f. For any ε > 0, we want to find a δ > 0 such that, for all x,
    
    if f(a) - δ < x < f(a) + δ, then a - ε < f^{-1}(x) < a + ε.
  - |-
    Figure 11 suggests the way of finding 6 (remember that by looking sideways you see the graph of f~!): since
    
    a—-éEe<a<ateé,
    
    it follows that
    fla—e) < f(a) < flat+e);
    
    we let 6 be the smaller of f(a+e)— f(a) and f(a)— f(a—e). Figure 11 contains
    the entire proof that this 6 works, and what follows is simply a verbal account of
    the information contained in this picture.
    
    Our choice of 5 ensures that
    
    f(a—e)< f(a)—é and f(a)+6 < fate).
    
    Consequently, if
    f(a)-—d <x < f(a)+46,
    
    then
    f(a-—eé)<x < f(at+e).

    Having successfully investigated continuity of f~!, it is only reasonable to tackle
    differentiability. Again, a picture indicates just what result ought to be true. Fig-
    ure 12 shows the graph of a one-one function f with a tangent line L through
    (a, f(a)). If this entire picture is reflected through the diagonal, it shows the graph
    of f~! and the tangent line L' through (f(a), a). The slope of L' is the reciprocal
    of the slope of L. In other words, it appears that

    AFT)
    Unfortunately, this is not a proof that f~! is differentiable, since the Chain Rule
    cannot be applied unless f—! is already known to be differentiable. But this argu-
    
    ment does show what (f~!)/(x) will have to be if f7! is differentiable, and it can
    also be used to obtain some important preliminary information.
    
    (f-')'(x) =
    
    If f is a continuous one-one function defined on an interval and f'(f~!(a)) = 0,
    then f~! is not differentiable at a.
    
    We have
    f(f-' (x) =x.
    
    If f—! were differentiable at a, the Chain Rule would imply that
    f'(f-'@)(f'Y@ = 1,
    
    hence
    0-(f-'Y(@) =1,
    which is absurd. J
    
    A simple example to which Theorem 4 applies is the function f(x) = x°. Since
    f'(0) =0 and 0 = f~!(0), the function f~! is not differentiable at 0 (Figure 13).
    
    Having decided where an inverse function cannot be differentiable, we are now
    ready for the rigorous proof that in all other cases the derivative is given by the
    formula which we have already "derived" in two different ways. Notice that the
    following argument uses continuity of f—!, which we have already proved.
    
    Let f be a continuous one-one function defined on an interval, and suppose that
    f is differentiable at f—!(b), with derivative f'(f~'(b)) 40. Then f7! is differ-
    
    entiable at b, and

    h-O h
    
     f 'b+h)-a
    = lim
    h—0O h
    
    Now every number b + A in the domain of f~! can be written in the form
    b+h= f(at+k)
    
    for a unique k (we should really write k(h), but we will stick with k for simplicity).

    $$
    
    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
    $$
    
    We are clearly on the right track! It is not hard to get an explicit expression for $k$;
    
    since
    
    $$
    b+h = f(a+k)
    $$
    
    we have
    
    $$
    f(b+h) = a + k
    $$
    
    or
    
    $$
    k = f(b+h) - f(a)
    $$
    
    Now by Theorem 3, the function $f^{-1}$ is continuous at $b$. This means that $k$
    approaches 0 as $h$ approaches 0. Since
    
    $$
    \lim_{k \to 0} \frac{f(a+k)-f(a)}{k}
    = f'(a)

    this implies that

    Then $f$ is a continuous one-one function, whose inverse function is
    
    $$
    B_n(x) = \sqrt{x} = x^{1/n}
    $$
    
    $$
    \frac{d}{dx} B_n(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^{-1/2}
    $$
    
    $$
    = \frac{1}{2} x^{(n-1)/n}
    $$
    
    Thus, if $f(x) = x^n$, and $a$ is an integer or the reciprocal of a natural number, then
    
    $$
    f'(x) = ax^{n-1}
    $$
    
    It is now easy to check that this formula is true if $a$ is any rational
    number: Let $a = \frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ is an integer, and $n$ is a natural number; if
    
    $$
    f(x) = x^{m/n}
    $$
    
    then, by the Chain Rule,
    
    $$
    \frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \frac{m}{n} x^{(m/n)-1}
    $$
    
    $$
    = \frac{m}{n} x^{(m - n)/n}
    $$
    
    $$
    = \frac{m}{n} x^{(m/n)-1}
    $$
    
    $$
    = \frac{m}{n} x^{(m - n)/n}

    $$
    = \frac{m}{n} x^{(m/n)-1}

    Although we now have a formula for f'(x) when f(x) = x^a and a is rational, the treatment of the function f(x) = x^a for irrational a will have to be saved for later—at the moment we do not even know the meaning of a symbol like x^√2. Actually, inverse functions will be involved crucially in the definition of x^a for irrational a. Indeed, in the next few chapters several important functions will be defined in terms of their inverse functions.

    In general, determining on what intervals a differentiable function is defined im-
    plicitly by a particular equation may be a delicate affair, and is best discussed in the
    context of advanced calculus. If we assume that f is such a differentiable solution,
    however, then a formula for f'(x) can be derived, exactly as in Problem 14(c), by
    differentiating both sides of the equation defining f (a process known as "implicit
    differentiation"):

    Leibnizian notation is particularly convenient for implicit differentiation. Be-  
    cause y is so consistently used as an abbreviation for f(x), the equation in x  
    and y which defines f implicitly will automatically stand for the equation  
    which f is supposed to satisfy. How would the following computation be  
    written in our notation?

    \frac{dy}{dx} \cdot y^2 + \frac{dy}{dx} \cdot 4y^3 \cdot x = 0,
    $$
    $$
    \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-y^2}{4y^3 x + 3y^2}
    $$
    
    As long as Leibnizian notation has entered the picture, the Leibnizian no-  
    tation for derivatives of inverse functions should be mentioned. If $\frac{dy}{dx}$  
    denotes the derivative of f, then the derivative of $f^{-1}$ is denoted by $\frac{dx}{dy}$.  
    Write out Theorem 5 in this notation. The resulting equation will show you  
    another reason why Leibnizian notation has such a large following. It will  
    also explain at which point $(f^{-1})'$ is to be calculated when using the $\frac{dx}{dy}$  
    notation. What is the significance of the following computation?

    APPENDIX. PARAMETRIC REPRESENTATION OF CURVES
    
    The material in this chapter serves to emphasize something that we noticed a long time ago—a perfectly nice looking curve need not be the graph of a function (Figure 1). In other words, we may not be able to describe it as the set of all points (x, f(x)). Of course, we might be able to describe the curve as the set of all points (f(x), x); for example, the curve in Figure | 1s the set of all points (x*,x). But even this trick doesn't work in most cases. It won't allow us to describe the circle, consisting of all points (x, y) with x* + y* = 1, or an ellipse, and it can't be used to describe a curve like the one in Figure 2.
  - |-
    The simplest way of describing curves in the plane in general harks back to the  
    physical conception of a curve as the path of a particle moving in the plane. At  
    each time t, the particle is at a certain point, which has two coordinates; to indicate  
    the dependence of these coordinates on the time t, we can call them u(t) and v(t).  
    Thus, we end up with two functions. Conversely, given two functions u and v, we  
    can consider the curve consisting of all points (u(t), v(t)). This curve is said to  
    be represented parametrically by u and v, and the pair of functions u, v is called a  
    parametric representation of the curve. The curve represented parametrically by  
    u and v thus consists of all pairs (x, y) with x = u(t) and y = v(t). It is often  
    described briefly as "the curve x = u(t), y = v(t)." Notice that the graph of a  
    function f can always be described parametrically, as the curve x = t, y = f(t).
    
    Instead of considering a curve in the plane as defined by two functions, we  
    can obtain a conceptually simpler picture if we broaden our original definition of  
    function somewhat. Instead of considering a rule which associates a number with  
    another number, we can consider a "function c from real numbers to the plane,"  
    i.e., a rule c that associates, to each number t, a point in the plane, which we can  
    denote by c(t). With this notion, a curve is just a function from some interval of  
    real numbers to the plane.
    
    Of course, these two different descriptions of a curve are essentially the same:  
    A pair of (ordinary) functions u and v determines a single function c from the real  
    numbers to the plane by the rule
    
    c(t) = (u(t), v(t)),
    
    and, conversely, given a function c from the real numbers to the plane, each c(t)  
    is a point in the plane, so it is a pair of numbers, which we can call u(t) and v(t),  
    so that we have unique functions u and v satisfying this equation.
  - |-
    In Appendix | to Chapter 4, we used the term "vector" to describe a point in
    the plane. In conformity with this usage, a curve in the plane may also be called
    a "vector-valued function." The conventions of that Appendix would lead us to
    write c(t) = (c(t), c2(t)), but in this Appendix we'll continue to use notation like
    c(t) = (u(t), v(t)) to minimize the use of subscripts.
    
    A simple example of a vector-valued function that is quite useful is
    
    e(t) = (cost, sin fF),
    
    which goes round and round the unit circle (Figure 3).

    For two (ordinary) functions f and g, we defined new functions f +g and f-g
    by the rules
    
    (1) (f + g8)(x) = f(x) + g(x),
    (2) (f - g)(x) = f(x): g(x).
    
    Since we have defined a way of adding vectors, we can imitate the first of these def-
    initions for vector-valued functions c and d: we define the vector-valued function
    c+d by
    
    (c+d)(t)=c(t)+d(t),
    
    where the + on the right-hand side is now the sum of vectors. ‘This simply amounts
    to saying that if
    
    c(t) = (u(t), v(t)),
    d(t) = (w(t), z(t)),
    
    then
    (c +d)(t) = (u(t), v(t)) + (w(t), z(t) = (u(t) + w(t), v(t) + 2(2)).
    
    Recall that we have also defined a - v for a number a and a vector v. To
    extend this to vector-valued functions, we want to consider an ordinary function a
    and a vector-valued function c, so that for each tf we have a number a(t) and a
    vector c(t). ‘Then we can define a new vector-valued function @ - c by
    
    (a-c)(t) =a(t)- c(t),
    
    where the - on the right-hand side is the product of a number and a vector. This
    simply amounts to saying that

    $$
    (@ -c)(t) = a(t) - (u(t), v(t)) = (a(t) - u(t), a(t) - v(t).
    $$
    Notice that the curve $ a -e $,
    $$
    (a -e)(t) = (a(t) \cos t, a(t) \sin f),
    $$
    is already quite general (Figure 4). In the notation of Appendix 3 to Chapter 4,
    the point $ (a -e)(t) $ has polar coordinates $ a(t) $ and $ \theta(t) $, so that $ (a -e)(t) $ is the "graph of $ \alpha $ in polar coordinates."
    
    Even more generally, given any vector-valued function $ c $, we can define new
    functions $ r $ and $ \theta $ by
    
    $$
    c(t) = r(t) - e(\alpha(t)),
    $$
    
    where $ r(t) $ is just the distance from the origin to $ c(t) $, and $ \alpha(t) $ is some choice of
    the angle of $ c(t) $ (as usual, the function $ \alpha $ isn't defined unambiguously, so one has
    to be careful when using this way of writing an arbitrary curve $ c $).
    
    We aren't in a position to extend (2) to vector-valued functions in general, since
    we haven't defined the product of two vectors. However, Problems 2 and 4 of
    Appendix | to Chapter 4 define two real-valued products $ v - w $ and $ \det(v, w) $. It
    $$
    246 Derivatives and Integrals
    
    should be clear, given vector-valued functions $ c $ and $ d $, how we would define two
    ordinary (real-valued) functions
    
    $$
    c \cdot d \quad \text{and} \quad \det(c, d).
    $$
    
    Beyond imitating simple arithmetic operations on functions, we can consider
    more interesting problems, like limits. For $ c(t) = (u(t), v(t)) $, we can define
    
    $$
    \lim_{t \to a} c(t) = \left( \lim_{t \to a} u(t), \lim_{t \to a} v(t) \right).
    $$
    Rules like
    $$
    \lim_{t \to a} [c + d] = \lim_{t \to a} c + \lim_{t \to a} d,
    $$
    $$
    \lim_{t \to a} [c - d] = \lim_{t \to a} c - \lim_{t \to a} d
    $$
    follow immediately. Problem 10 shows how to give an equivalent definition that
    imitates the basic definition of limits directly.
    Limits lead us of course to derivatives. For

    $$ c(t) = \left( u(Z), v(t) \right) $$
    
    We can define $ c' $ by the straightforward definition:
    
    $$
    c'(a) = \left( u'(a), v'(a) \right).
    $$
    
    We could also try to imitate the basic definition:
    
    $$
    c'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{c(a + h) - c(a)}{h}
    $$
    
    where the fraction on the right-hand side is understood to mean:
    
    $$
    \frac{1}{h} [c(a + h) - c(a)].
    $$
    
    As a matter of fact, these two definitions are equivalent, because:
    
    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{c(a + h) - c(a)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{u(a + h) - u(a)}{h} + \frac{v(a + h) - v(a)}{h}.
    $$
    
    By our definition (*) of limits:
    
    $$
    = \left( u'(a), v'(a) \right).
    $$
    
    Figure 5 shows $ c(a + h) $ and $ c(a) $, as well as the arrow from $ c(a) $ to $ c(a + h) $; as we showed in Appendix I to Chapter 4, this arrow is $ c(a + h) - c(a) $, except moved over so that it starts at $ c(a) $. As $ h \to 0 $, this arrow would appear to move closer and closer to the tangent of our curve, so it seems reasonable to define the tangent line of $ c $ at $ c(a) $ to be the straight line along $ c'(a) $, when $ c'(a) $ is moved over so that it starts at $ c(a) $. In other words, we define the tangent line of $ c $ at $ c(a) $ as the set of all points
    
    $$
    c(a) + s \cdot c'(a);
    $$
    
    for $ s = 0 $ we get the point $ c(a) $ itself, for $ s = 1 $ we get $ c(a) + c'(a) $, etc. (Note, however, that this definition does not make sense when $ c'(a) = (0, 0) $.)
    
    Problem 1 shows that this definition agrees with the old one when our curve $ c $ is defined by
    
    $$
    c(t) = (t, f(t)),
    $$
    
    so that we simply have the graph of $ f $.
    
    Once again, various old formulas have analogues. For example,
  - |-
    (c + d)'(a) = c'(a) + d(a),
    (α - c)'(a) = a'(a) - c(a) + α(a) - c'(a),
    or, as equations involving functions,
    (c + d)' = c' + d',
    (α - c)' = α' - c'.
    
    These formulas can be derived immediately from the definition in terms of the
    component functions. They can also be derived from the definition as a limit,
    by imitating previous proofs; for the second, we would of course use the standard
    trick of writing
    
    a(a + h)c(a + h) - a(a)c(a) =
    a(a + h) - [c(a + h) - c(a)] + [a(a + h) - a(a)] - c(a).
    
    We can also consider the function
    d(t) = c(p(t)) = (c ◦ p)(t),
    
    where p is now an ordinary function, from numbers to numbers. The new curve d
    passes through the same points as c, except at different times; thus p corresponds
    to a "reparameterization" of c. For
    
    c = (u, v),
    d = (u ◦ p, v ◦ p),
    
    we obtain
    d'(a) = ((u ◦ p)'(a), (v ◦ p)'(a))
    = (p'(a)u'(p(a)), p'(a)v'(p(a)))
    = p'(a)(u'(p(a)), v'(p(a)))
    = p'(a) - c'(p(a)),
    or simply
    
    d' = p' ◦ c'.
    
    Notice that if p(a) = a, so that d and c actually pass through the same point at
    time a, then d'(a) = p'(a) - c'(a), so that the tangent vector d'(a) is just a multiple
    of c'(a). This means that the tangent line to c at c(a) is the same as the tangent
    line to the reparameterized curve d at d(a) = c(a). The one exception occurs

    When p'(a) = O, since the tangent line for d is then undefined, even though the
    tangent line for c may be defined. For example, d(t) = c(t?) won't have a tangent
    line defined at t = 0, even though it's merely a reparameterization of c.
    
    Finally, since we can define real-valued functions
    
    (c-d)(t) =c(t)-d(t),
    det(c, d)(t) = det(c(t), d(t)),
    
    we ought to have formulas for the derivatives of these new functions. As you might
    guess, the proper formulas are
    
    (c-d)'(a) =c(a)-d'(a) + c'(a) + d(a),
    [det(c, d)]‘(a) = det(c', d)(a) + det(c, d')(a).
    
    These can be derived by straightforward calculations from the definitions in terms
    of the component functions. But it is more elegant to imitate the proof of the or-
    dinary product rule, using the simple formulas in Problems 2 and 4 of Appendix 1
    to Chapter 4, and, of course, the "standard trick" referred to above.
    
    PROBLEMS
    
    1. (a) For a function f, the "point-slope form" (Problem 4-6) of the tangent
    line at (a, f(a)) can be written as y — f(a) = (x — a) f'(a), so that the
    tangent line consists of all points of the form
    
    (x, f(a) + (x —a)f'(a)).
    
    Conclude that the tangent line consists of all points of the form
    (a+s, f(a) +sf'(a)).
    
    (b) If c is the curve c(t) = (t, f(t)), conclude that the tangent line of c at
    (a, f(a)) [using our new definition] is the same as the tangent line of f
    
    at (a, f(a)).

    2. Let c(t) = (f(d), t*), where f is the function shown in Figure 21 of Chapter 9. Show that c hes along the graph of the non-differentiable function h(x) = |x|, but that c'(O) = (0, 0). In other words, a reparameterization can "hide" a corner. For this reason, we are usually only interested in curves c with c' never equal to (0, 0).
    
    3. Suppose that x = u(t), y = v(t) is a parametric representation of a curve, and that uw is one-one on some interval.

You can see a beautiful cycloid by pasting a reflector on the edge of a bicycle wheel and having a friend ride slowly in front of the headlights of your car at night. Lacking a car, bicycle, or trusting friend, you can settle instead for Figure 9.

    The derivative does not display its full strength until allied with the "integral," the
    second main concept of Part III. At first this topic may seem to be a complete
    digression—in this chapter derivatives do not appear even once! The study of
    integrals does require a long preparation, but once this preliminary work has been
    completed, integrals will be an invaluable tool for creating new functions, and the
    derivative will reappear in Chapter 14, more powerful than ever.
    
    Although ultimately to be defined in a quite complicated way, the integral for-
    malizes a simple, intuitive concept—that of area. By now it should come as
    no surprise to learn that the definition of an intuitive concept can present great
    difficulties—"area" is certainly no exception.
    
    In elementary geometry, formulas are derived for the areas of many plane fig-
    ures, but a little reflection shows that an acceptable definition of area is seldom
    given. The area of a region is sometimes defined as the number of squares, with
    sides of length 1, which fit in the region. But this definition is hopelessly inadequate
    for any but the simplest regions. For example, a circle of radius 1 supposedly has
    an area the irrational number π, but it is not at all clear what "π squares" means.
    Even if we consider a circle of radius √(1/2), which supposedly has area 1, it is hard
    to say in what way a unit square fits in this circle, since it does not seem possible
    to divide the unit square into pieces which can be arranged to form a circle.
  - |-
    In this chapter we will only try to define the area of some very special regions
    (Figure 1)—those which are bounded by the horizontal axis, the vertical lines
    through (a,0) and (b,0), and the graph of a function f such that f(x) > 0
    for all x in [a, b]. It is convenient to indicate this region by R(f, a, b). Notice that
    these regions include rectangles and triangles, as well as many other important
    geometric figures.
    
    The number which we will eventually assign as the area of R(f, a,b) will be
    called the integral of f on [a,b]. Actually, the integral will be defined even for
    functions f which do not satisfy the condition f(x) > 0 for all x in [a,b]. If f is
    the function graphed in Figure 2, the integral will represent the difference of the
    area of the lightly shaded region and the area of the heavily shaded region (the
    "algebraic area" of R(f,a, b)).
    
    The idea behind the prospective definition is indicated in Figure 3. The interval
    [a, b] has been divided into four subintervals
    
    [fo, t1], [t1, t2], [t2, t3], [t3, t4]
    by means of numbers fo, f1, t2, t3, t4 with
    a = t0 < t1 < t2 < t3 < t4 = b
    
    (the numbering of the subscripts begins with 0 so that the largest subscript will
    equal the number of subintervals).

    DEFINITION
    
    On the first interval [t0, t1] the function f has the minimum value m1, and the
    maximum value M1; similarly, on the second interval [t1, t2] let the minimum value
    of f be m2 and let the maximum value be M2; on the third interval [t2, t3] let the minimum value
    of f be m3 and let the maximum value be M3; on the fourth interval [t3, t4] let the minimum value
    of f be m4 and let the maximum value be M4. The sum
    
    s = m1(t1 - t0) + m2(t2 - t1) + m3(t3 - t2) + m4(t4 - t3)
    
    represents the total area of rectangles lying inside the region R(f, a,b), while the
    sum
    
    S = M1(t1 - t0) + M2(t2 - t1) + M3(t3 - t2) + M4(t4 - t3)
    
    represents the total area of rectangles lying outside the region R(f, a,b).

    represents the total area of rectangles containing the region R(f, a,b). The guiding principle of our attempt to define the area A of R(f,a, b) is the observation that A should satisfy
    
    s < A and A < S,
    
    and that this should be true, no matter how the interval {a, b} is subdiided. It is to be hoped that these requirements will determine A. The following definitions begin to formalize, and eliminate some of the implicit assumptions in, this discussion.
    
    Let a < b. A partition of the interval [a, b] is a finite collection of points in
    [a, b], one of which is a, and one of which is b.
    
    The points in a partition can be numbered t1, ..., tn, so that
    a = t0 < t1 < ... < tn = b;
    
    we shall always assume that such a numbering has been assigned.
    
    Suppose f is bounded on [a, b] and P = {t0, ..., tn} is a partition of [a, b]. Let
    
    m_i = inf{ f(x): t_{i-1} < x < t_i},
    M_i = sup{ f(x) : t_{i-1} < x < t_i}.
    
    The lower sum of f for P, denoted by L(f, P), is defined as
    L(f, P) = Σ m_i (t_i - t_{i-1}).
    i=1
    The upper sum of f for P, denoted by U(f, P), is defined as
    
    U(f, P) = Σ M_i (t_i - t_{i-1}).
    i=1
    
    The lower and upper sums correspond to the sums s and S in the previous
    example; they are supposed to represent the total areas of rectangles lying below
    and above the graph of f. Notice, however, that despite the geometric motivation,
    these sums have been defined precisely without any appeal to a concept of "area."

    Two details of the definition deserve comment. The requirement that f be  
    bounded on [a, b] is essential in order that all the m; and M; be defined. Note,  
    also, that it was necessary to define the numbers m; and M; as inf's and sup's,  
    rather than as minima and maxima, since f was not assumed continuous.
    
    One thing is clear about lower and upper sums: If P is any partition, then
    
    L(f, P) < U(f, P),
    
    because
    
    L(f, P) = Σ (m_i Δx_i),
    i=1
    
    U(f,P) = Σ (M_i Δx_i),
    i=1
    
    and for each i we have
    m_i Δx_i < M_i Δx_i.
    
    On the other hand, something less obvious ought to be true: If P1 and P2 are  
    any two partitions of [a, b], then it should be the case that
    
    L(f, P1) < U(f, P2),
    
    because L(f, P1) should be < area of R(f, a,b), and U(f, P2) should be > area  
    of R(f,a, b). This remark proves nothing (since the "area of R(f, a, b)" has not even  
    been defined yet), but it does indicate that if there is to be any hope of defining the  
    area of R(f, a,b), a proof that L(f, P1) < U(f, P2) should come first. The proof  
    which we are about to give depends upon a lemma which concerns the behavior of  
    lower and upper sums when more points are included in a partition. In Figure 4  
    the partition P contains the points in black, and Q contains both the points in  
    black and the points in grey. The picture indicates that the rectangles drawn for  
    the partition Q are a better approximation to the region R(f, a, b) than those for  
    the original partition P. 'To be precise:
    
    If Q contains P (i.e., if all points of P are also in Q), then
    
    L(f, P) < L(f, Q),
    U(f, P) > U(f, Q).
    
    Consider first the special case (Figure 5) in which Q contains just one more point  
    than P:

    Let
    
    m' = inf{ f(x): &-1 <x <u},

    To prove that L(f, P) < L(f, Q) it therefore suffices to show that
    my (th — te-1) < m'(u — th_1) +m" (te — U).
    
    Now the set { f(x) : (1 < x < t,} contains all the numbers in { f(x) : {_) <
    x <u}, and possibly some smaller ones, so the greatest lower bound of the first set
    is less than or equal to the greatest lower bound of the second; thus
    
    m<m'.
    Similarly,
    my, <m".
    Therefore,
    my (th — te_1) = mg(u — the_-1) + mg (te — u) < m'(u — 1) +m" (th — U).
    
    This proves, in this special case, that L(f, P) < L(f, Q). The proof that U(f, P) =
    U(f, Q) 1s similar, and 1s left to you as an easy, but valuable, exercise.
    
    The general case can now be deduced quite easily. The partition Q can be
    obtained from P by adding one point at a time; in other words, there is a sequence

    There is a partition P which contains both P; and P) (let P consist of all points
    in both P; and P). According to the lemma,
    
    L(f, P\) < L(f, P) < U(f, P) < U(f. Po). §
    
    It follows from Theorem | that any upper sum U(f, P') 1s an upper bound for
    the set of all lower sums L(f, P). Consequently, any upper sum U(f, P') is greater
    than or equal to the least upper bound of all lower sums:
    
    sup{L(f, P) : P a partition of [a, b]} < UCf, P'),
    
    for every P'. ‘This, in turn, means that sup{L(f, P)} is a lower bound for the set
    of all upper sums of f. Consequently,
    
    sup{L(f, P)} < inf {U(f, P)}.
    
    It is clear that both of these numbers are between the lower sum and upper sum
    of f for all partitions:
    
    L(f, P') < sup{L(f, P)} < UC, P'),
    L(f, P') <mf{U(f, P)} < Uf, P'),
    
    for all partitions P'.
    It may well happen that
    
    sup{L(f, P)} = inf {U(f, P};
    
    in this case, this is the only number between the lower sum and upper sum of f
    for all partitions, and this number is consequently an ideal candidate for the area

    of R(f, a,b). On the other hand, if
    sup{L(f, P)} < inf{U(f, P)},
    then every number x between sup{L(f, P)} and inf {U(f, P)} will satisfy
    L(f,P) <x <U(f,P)
    
    for all partitions P'.
    
    It is not at all clear just when such an embarrassment of riches will occur. The
    following two examples, although not as interesting as many which will soon ap-
    pear, show that both phenomena are possible.
    
    Suppose first that f(x) = c for all x in [a,b] (Figure 6). If P = {t0,...,tn} is
    any partition of [a,b], then
    
    mi = M; = C,
    
    SO
    L(f, P) = Σ elti —ti-1) = c(b— a),
    i=1
    
    U(f,P) = Σ elti — 4-1) = c(b— a),

    DEFINITION
    
    In this case, all lower sums and upper sums are equal, and
    sup{L(f, P)} = inf {U(f, P)} =c(b —a).
    
    Now consider (Figure 7) the function f defined by
    
    0, if x is irrational
    f(x) = 1, if x is rational.
    If P = {t0,...,tn} is any partition, then
    
    mi = 0, since there is an irrational number in [ti-1, ti],
    and
    M; = 1, since there is a rational number in [ti-1, ti].
    
    Therefore,
    
    L(f, P) = Σ 0*(ti — ti-1) = 0,
    i=1
    
    U(f,P) = Σ 1*(ti — ti-1) = b-a.

    Thus, in this case it is certainly not true that sup{L(f, P)} = inf {U(f, P)}. The
    principle upon which the definition of area was to be based provides insufficient
    information to determine a specific area for R(f, a, b)—any number between 0
    and b — a seems equally good. On the other hand, the region R(f, a, b) is so
    weird that we might with justice refuse to assign it any area at all. In fact, we can
    maintain, more generally, that whenever
    
    sup{L(f, P)} ≠ inf {U(f, P)},
    
    the region R(f,a,b) is too unreasonable to deserve having an area. As our ap-
    peal to the word "unreasonable" suggests, we are about to cloak our ignorance in
    terminology.
    
    A function f which is bounded on [a, b] is integrable on [a, b] if
    sup{L(f, P) : P a partition of [a, b]} = inf{U(f, P) : P a partition of [a, b]}.
    
    In this case, this common number is called the integral of f on [a,b] and is
    
    denoted by
    b
    ∫
    +
    (The symbol ∫ is called an integral sign and was originally an elongated s, for
    "sum;" the numbers a and b are called the lower and upper limits of integration.)
    The integral ∫ f is also called the area of R(f,a,b) when f(x) > 0 for all x
    in [a, b].
    
    THEOREM 2
    
    PROOF
    
    13. Integrals 259
    
    If f is integrable, then according to this definition,
    b
    L(f, P) < ∫ f < U(f, P) for all partitions P of [a, b].
    
    Moreover, ∫ f is the unique number with this property.
    
    This definition merely pinpoints, and does not solve, the problem discussed
    before: we do not know which functions are integrable (nor do we know how to
    find the integral of f on [a,b] when f is integrable). At present we know only
    two examples:
  - |-
    b  
    (1) if f(x) = c, then f is integrable on [a, b] and |f| = c*(b - a).  
    
    (Notice that this integral assigns the expected area to a rectangle.)  
    
    Q,  
    $$
    \begin{cases}
    1, & \text{x rational} \\
    0, & \text{x irrational}
    \end{cases}
    $$  
    
    (2) if f(x) = $$\begin{cases}  
    1, & \text{x rational} \\  
    0, & \text{x irrational}  
    \end{cases}$$ then f is not integrable on [a, b].  
    
    Several more examples will be given before discussing these problems further.  
    Even for these examples, however, it helps to have the following simple criterion  
    for integrability stated explicitly.  
    
    If f is bounded on [a,b], then f is integrable on [a, b] if and only if for every  
    ε > 0 there is a partition P of [a,b] such that  
    
    U(f, P) — L(f, P) < ε.  
    
    Suppose first that for every ε > 0 there is a partition P with  
    Since  
    
    inf{U(f, P')} < U(f, P),  
    sup{L(f, P')} = L(f, P),  
    
    it follows that  
    inf{U(f, P')} — sup{L(f, P')} < ε.  
    
    Since this is true for all ε > 0, it follows that  
    sup{L(f, P')} = inf {U(f, P')} :  
    
    by definition, then, f is integrable. The proof of the converse assertion is similar:  
    If f is integrable, then  
    
    sup{L(f, P)} = inf{U(f, P)}.  
    This means that for each ε > 0 there are partitions P', P" with  
    
    U(f, P") — L(f, P') < ε.  
    
    Let P be a partition which contains both P' and P". Then, according to the  
    lemma,  
    
    U(f, P) < U(f, P'),  
    L(f, P) = L(f, P');  
    
    consequently,  
    
    U(f, P) — L(f, P) < U(f, P") — L(f, P') < ε.

    Although the mechanics of the proof take up a little space, it should be clear that Theorem 2 amounts to nothing more than a restatement of the definition of integrability. Nevertheless, it is a very convenient restatement because there is no mention of sup's and inf's, which are often difficult to work with. The next example illustrates this point, and also serves as a good introduction to the type of reasoning which the complicated definition of the integral necessitates, even in very simple situations.
    
    Let $ f $ be defined on $[0, 2]$ by
    
    $$
    f(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
    0, & x \ne 1 \\
    1, & x = 1
    \end{cases}
    $$
    
    Suppose $ P = \{t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_n\} $ is a partition of $[0,2]$ with
    
    $$
    t_{j-1} < t_j < t_{j+1}
    $$
    
    (see Figure 8). Then
    
    $$
    L(f, P) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i (t_i - t_{i-1}) = \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} m_i (t_i - t_{i-1}) + \sum_{i=j}^{n} m_i (t_i - t_{i-1})
    $$
    
    but
    
    $$
    L(f, P) = \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} m_i (t_i - t_{i-1}) + m_j (t_j - t_{j-1}) + \sum_{i=j+1}^{n} m_i (t_i - t_{i-1})
    $$
    
    Since
    
    $$
    m_i = 
    \begin{cases}
    0, & i \ne j \\
    1, & i = j
    \end{cases}
    $$
    
    we have
    
    $$
    U(f, P) - L(f, P) = M_j (t_j - t_{j-1}) - m_j (t_j - t_{j-1}) = (M_j - m_j)(t_j - t_{j-1})
    $$
    
    This certainly shows that $ f $ is integrable: to obtain a partition $ P $ with
    
    $$
    U(f, P) - L(f, P) < \epsilon,
    $$
    
    it is only necessary to choose a partition with $ t_j < 1 < t_{j+1} $ and $ t_j - t_{j-1} < \epsilon $. Moreover, it is clear that
    
    $$
    L(f, P) < 0 < U(f, P) \text{ for all partitions } P.
    $$
    
    FIGURE 9
    
    13. Integrals 261
    
    Since $ f $ is integrable, there is only one number between all lower and upper sums,
    
    namely, the integral of $ f $, so
    
    $$
    \int_0^2 f = 0.
    $$
    
    Although the discontinuity of $ f $ was responsible for the difficulties in this example, even worse problems arise for very simple continuous functions. For example, let $ f(x) = x $, and for simplicity consider an interval $[0,b]$, where $ b > 0 $. If

    desired, so there is only one number with this property. Since the integral certainly  
    has this property, we can conclude that  
    
    b²/2 is

    The function f(x) = x² presents even greater difficulties. In this case (Fig-  
    ure 11), if P = {x₀, x₁, ..., xₙ} is a partition of [0, b], then  
    
    mᵢ = f(xᵢ₋₁) = (xᵢ₋₁)² and Mᵢ = f(xᵢ) = (xᵢ)².  
    Choosing, once again, a partition Pₙ = {x₀, x₁, ..., xₙ} into n equal parts, so that  
    xᵢ = a + i(b - a)/n,  
    
    the lower and upper sums become  
    
    L(f, Pₙ) = Σ (xᵢ₋₁)² Δx  
    U(f, Pₙ) = Σ (xᵢ)² Δx  
    
    where Δx = b/n.  
    
    For the specific case where a = 0 and b is the upper limit, we have:  
    xᵢ = i(b)/n  
    
    So the lower sum becomes:  
    L(f, Pₙ) = Σ (i(b)/n - b/n)² * (b/n)  
    = Σ ((i-1)b/n)² * (b/n)  
    = b³/n³ Σ (i-1)²  
    
    Similarly, the upper sum becomes:  
    U(f, Pₙ) = Σ (i(b)/n)² * (b/n)  
    = b³/n³ Σ i²  
    
    Using the formula for the sum of squares:  
    Σ i² = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6  
    
    These sums can be written as:  
    L(f, Pₙ) = b³/n³ * (n-1)n(2n - 1)/6  
    U(f, Pₙ) = b³/n³ * n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6  
    
    It is not too hard to show that  
    L(f, Pₙ) ≤ ∫₀ᵇ f(x) dx ≤ U(f, Pₙ)

    The computations of ∫ f(x) dx and ∫ g(x) dx may suggest that evaluating integrals is generally difficult or impossible. As a matter of fact, the integrals of most functions are impossible to determine exactly (although they may be computed to any degree of accuracy desired by calculating lower and upper sums). Nevertheless, as we shall see in the next chapter, the integral of many functions can be computed very easily.
    
    Even though most integrals cannot be computed exactly, it is important at least to know when a function f is integrable on [a,b]. Although it is possible to say precisely which functions are integrable, the criterion for integrability is a little too difficult to be stated here, and we will have to settle for partial results. The next Theorem gives the most useful result, but the proof given here uses material from the Appendix to Chapter 8. If you prefer, you can wait until the end of the next chapter, when a totally different proof will be given.
    
    * Lest chaos overtake the reader when consulting other books, equation (1) requires an important qualification. This equation interprets ∫[a,b] f(x) dx to mean the integral of the function f such that each value f(x) is the number y. But classical notation often uses y for y(x), so ∫[a,b] y dx might mean the integral of some arbitrary function y.

    THEOREM 3
    
    PROOF
    
    If f is continuous on [a,b], then f is integrable on [a, b].
    
    Notice, first, that f is bounded on [a, b], because it is continuous on [a, b]. To prove that f is integrable on [a, b], we want to use Theorem 2, and show that for every ε > 0 there is a partition P of [a, b] such that
    
    U(f, P) − L(f, P) < ε.
    
    Now we know, by Theorem 1 of the Appendix to Chapter 8, that f is uniformly continuous on [a,b]. So there is some δ > 0 such that for all x and y in [a, b], if |x − y| < δ, then |f(x) − f(y)| < ε.

    Although this theorem will provide all the information necessary for the use of
    integrals in this book, it 1s more satisfying to have a somewhat larger supply of
    integrable functions. Several problems treat this question in detail. It wul help to
    know the following three theorems, which show that f is integrable on [a, b], if it
    is integrable on [a,c] and [c, b]; that f + g 1s integrable if f and g are; and that
    c- f is integrable if f is integrable and c 1s any number.
    
    As a simple application of these theorems, recall that if f 1s O except at one
    point, where its value is 1, then f is integrable. Multiplying this function by c, it
    follows that the same is true if the value of f at the exceptional point 1s c. Adding
    such a function to an integrable function, we see that the value of an integrable
    function may be changed arbitrarily at one point without destroying integrability.
    By breaking up the interval into many subintervals, we see that the value can be
    changed at finitely many points.
    
    The proofs of these theorems usually use the alternative criterion for integrability
    in [heorem 2; as some of our previous demonstrations illustrate, the details of the

    THEOREM 4  
    PROOF  
    
    Let a < c < b. If f is integrable on [a, b], then f is integrable on [a,c] and on [c, b]. Conversely, if f is integrable on [a,c] and on [c, b], then f is integrable on [a,b]. Finally, if f is integrable on [a, b], then  
    
    $$
    \int_a^b f(x) dx = \int_a^c f(x) dx + \int_c^b f(x) dx
    $$  
    
    Suppose f is integrable on [a, b]. If ε > 0, there is a partition P = {x_0, ..., x_n} of [a,b] such that  
    $$
    U(f, P) - L(f, P) < \epsilon.
    $$  
    
    We might as well assume that c = x_j for some j. (Otherwise, let Q be the partition which contains x_0, ..., x_j and c; then Q contains P, so  
    $$
    U(f,Q) - L(f,Q) < U(f, P) - L(f, P) < \epsilon.
    $$  
    
    Now P' = {x_0, ..., x_j} is a partition of [a,c] and P'' = {x_j, ..., x_n} is a partition of [c, b] (Figure 12). Since  
    $$
    L(f, P) = L(f, P') + L(f, P''),
    $$  
    $$
    U(f,P) = U(f,P') + U(f, P''),
    $$  
    we have  
    $$
    (U(f, P') - L(f, P')) + (U(f, P'') - L(f, P'')) = U(f, P) - L(f, P) < \epsilon.
    $$  
    
    Since each of the terms in brackets is nonnegative, each is less than ε. This shows that f is integrable on [a,c] and [c, b]. Note also that  
    $$
    L(f, P') \leq \int_a^c f(x) dx \leq U(f, P'),

    If P is the partition of [a,b] containing all the points of P' and P", then
    
    L(f, P) = L(f, P') + L(f, P"),  
    U(f, P) = U(f, P') + U(f, P");

    L(f, P) + L(g, P) < L(f + g, P)

    Thus,
    
    L(f, P) + L(g, P) < L(f + g, P) < U(f + g, P) < U(f, P) + U(g, P).
    Since f and g are integrable, there are partitions P', P" with

    If P contains both P' and P", then
    U(f, P) + U(g, P) - [L(f, P) + L(g, P)] < ε,
    
    and consequently
    U(f + g, P) - L(f + g, P) < ε.
    
    This proves that f + g is integrable on [a, b]. Moreover,

    desired, it follows that
    
    U(f, P) + U(g, P) - [L(f, P) + L(g, P)]

    In this chapter we have acquired only one complicated definition, a few simple theorems with intricate proofs, and one theorem which required material from the Appendix to Chapter 8. This is not because integrals constitute a more difficult topic than derivatives, but because powerful tools developed in previous chapters have been allowed to remain dormant. The most significant discovery of calculus is the fact that the integral and the derivative are intimately related—once we learn the connection, the integral will become as useful as the derivative, and as easy to use. The connection between derivatives and integrals deserves a separate chapter, but the preparations which we will make in this chapter may serve as a hint. We first state a simple inequality concerning integrals, which plays a role in many important theorems.

    for every partition P. Since is f = sup{L(f, P)} = nf {UCf, P)}, the desired
    inequality follows immediately. §
    Suppose now that f is integrable on [a, b]. We can define a new function f on
    
    [a, 5} by
    Fi = | =f f(t) dt.
    (This depends on Theorem 4.) We have seen that f may be integrable even if it
    
    is not continuous, and the Problems give examples of integrable functions which
    are quite pathological. ‘The behavior of F is therefore a very pleasant surprise.

    It might be of interest to compare this problem with the following extract

    LEMMA II
    
    Tf in any figure Aack, terminated by the right lines Aa, AE, and the curve ack,
    there be inscribed any number of parallelograms Ab, Bc, Cd, &c., comprehended
    under equal bases AB, BC, CD, &c., and the sides, Bb, Cc, Dd, &c., parallel
    to one side Aa of the figure; and the parallelograms Abbl, Bcmm, Cden, &c., are
    completed: then if the breadth of those parallelograms be supposed to be diminished,
    and their number to be augmented in infinitum, I say, that the ultimate ratios
    which the inscribed figure AbblCmDnD, the circumscribed figure AalbmcndoE,
    and curvilinear figure AabcdE, will have to one another, are ratios of equality.
    
    For the difference of the inscribed and circumscribed figures is the
    sum of the parallelograms Bl, Cm, Dn, Eo, that is (from the equality
    of all their bases), the rectangle under one of their bases Bl and the
    sum of their altitudes Aa, that is, the rectangle ABla. But this rectangle,
    because its breadth AB is supposed diminished in infinitum, becomes less
    than any given space. And therefore (by Lem. 1) the figures inscribed
    and circumscribed become ultimately equal one to another; and much
    more will the intermediate curvilinear figure be ultimately equal to either.

    a
    bases of all the rectangles are narrow enough, then the Riemann sum ought to be
    close to the integral. The following theorem states this precisely.
    
    Suppose that f is integrable on [a,b]. Then for every ε > 0 there is some δ > 0
    such that, if P = {x0,...,xn} is any partition of [a, b] with all lengths Δxi < δ,
    then
    
    ∑_{i=1}^n f(x_i)Δx_i ≈ ∫_a^b f(x) dx
    
    for any Riemann sum formed by choosing x_i in [x_{i-1}, x_i].
    
    Since the Riemann sum and the integral both lie between L(f, P) and U(f, P),
    this amounts to showing that for any given ε we can make U(f, P) — L(f, P) < ε
    by choosing a δ such that U(f, P) — L(f, P) < ε for any partition with all lengths
    Δx_i < δ.
    
    The definition of f being integrable on [a, b] includes the condition that |f| < M for some M. First choose some particular partition P* = {x0, ..., xn} for
    which
    
    U(f, P*)— L(f, P*) < ε/2,
    
    and then choose a δ such that
    
    δ < ε/(2M).
    
    For any partition P with all Δx_i < δ, we can break the sum
    
    U(f, P) - L(f, P) = ∑_{i=1}^n (M - m_i)(x_i - x_{i-1})
    
    as
    
    into two sums. The first involves those i for which the interval [x_{i-1}, x_i] is completely contained within one of the intervals [x_{j-1}, x_j]. This sum is clearly <
    U(f, P*) — L(f, P*) < ε/2. For all other i we will have x_{i-1} < x_j < x_i for some j = 1,..., K — 1, so there are at most K — 1 of them. Consequently, the sum for these terms is < (K —1)·2M·δ < ε/2. J

    The moral of this tale is that anything which looks like a good approximation
    to an integral really is, provided that all the lengths ¢; — t¢;_, of the intervals in the
    partition are small enough. Some of the following problems should bring home
    this message with even greater force.

    sum and a Riemann sum; you will need to use uniform continuity (Chapter

        [4 THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM  
    CHAPTER OF CALCULUS  
    
    THEOREM 1 (THE FIRST  
    FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM  
    OF CALCULUS)  
    
    PROOF  
    
    From the hints given in the previous chapter you may have already guessed the  
    first theorem of this chapter. We know that if f is integrable, then F(x) = f" f is  
    continuous; it is only fitting that we ask what happens when the original function f  
    is continuous. It turns out that F is differentiable (and its derivative is especially  
    simple).  
    
    Let f be integrable on [a, b], and define F on [a, b] by  
    
    F(x) -|/ f.  
    
    If f is continuous at c in [a,b], then F 1s differentiable at c, and  
    
    F'(c) = f(c).  
    
    (If c =a or b, then F'(c) is understood to mean the right- or left-hand derivative  
    of F.)  
    
    We will assume that c is in (a, b); the easy modifications for c = a or b may be  
    supplied by the reader. By definition,  
    
    F'(c) = lim ETD FO  
    h-OQ h  
    
    Suppose first that h > 0. Then  
    
    cth  
    Fic+h)- Fo)= | f.  
    
    Define m; and M,, as follows (Figure 1):  
    
    m, = inf{f(x):c<x<cth},  
    M, =sup{f(x):c<x<c+h}.
  - |-
    It follows from Theorem 13-7 that  
    $$ c+h $$  
    $$ \inf\{ f(x): c < x < c+h \} \leq \frac{1}{h} \int_c^{c+h} f(x) dx \leq \sup\{ f(x): c < x < c+h \} $$
    
    Therefore  
    $$ m, < \frac{1}{h} \int_c^{c+h} f(x) dx < M_y $$
    
    If $ h < 0 $, only a few details of the argument have to be changed. Let  
    $$ m, = \inf\{ f(x): c+h < x < c \} $$  
    $$ M, = \sup\{ f(x): c+h < x < c \} $$
    
    285  
    $$
    \frac{1}{-h} < f < M,-(-h)
    $$
    
    Since  
    $$
    \int_{c+h}^c f(x) dx = - \int_c^{c+h} f(x) dx
    $$
    
    this yields  
    $$
    m,-h > \int_{c+h}^c f(x) dx > M,-h
    $$
    
    Since $ h < 0 $, dividing by $ h $ reverses the inequality again, yielding the same result as before:  
    $$
    \frac{\int_{c+h}^c f(x) dx}{h} < \frac{1}{h} \int_c^{c+h} f(x) dx < \frac{\int_{c+h}^c f(x) dx}{h}
    $$
    
    This inequality is true for any integrable function, continuous or not. Since $ f $ is continuous at $ c $, however,
    
    $$
    \lim_{h \to 0^+} m_h = \lim_{h \to 0^+} M_h = f(c)
    $$
    
    and this proves that  
    $$
    \frac{F(c+h) - F(c)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{F(c+h) - F(c)}{h}
    $$
    
    $$
    = f(c)
    $$
    
    Although Theorem 1 deals only with the function obtained by varying the upper limit of integration, a simple trick shows what happens when the lower limit is varied. If $ G $ is defined by  
    $$
    G(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt
    $$
    
    then  
    $$
    G'(x) = f(x)
    $$
    
    Consequently, if $ f $ is continuous at $ c $, then  
    $$
    G'(c) = f(c)
    $$
    
    The minus sign appearing here is very fortunate, and allows us to extend Theorem 1 to the situation where the function  
    $$
    F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt
    $$
    
    is defined even for $ x < a $. In this case we can write  
    $$
    F(x) = - \int_x^a f(t) dt
    $$
    
    $$
    F'(x) = -(-f(x)) = f(x)
    $$
    
    so if $ c < a $ we have  
    exactly as before.
  - |-
    Notice that in either case, differentiability of F at c is ensured by continuity of f at c alone. Nevertheless, 'Theorem | is most interesting when f is continuous at all points in [a,b]. In this case F is differentiable at all points in [a, b] and
    
    F' = f.
    
    In general, it is extremely difficult to decide whether a given function f 1s the derivative of some other function; for this reason Theorem I11-7 and Problems 11-60 and 11-61 are particularly interesting, since they reveal certain properties which f must have. If f 1s continuous, however, there is no problem at all—according to Theorem 1, f zs the derivative of some function, namely the
    
    function .
    F(x) -|/ f.
    
    Theorem | has a simple corollary which frequently reduces computations of
    integrals to a triviality.
    
    If f is continuous on [a,b] and f = g' for some function g, then
    
    b
    | f = g(b) — g(a).
    
    Foy = f f.
    
    Then F' = f = g' on [a, b]. Consequently, there 1s a number c such that
    
    Let
    
    F=e¢g+e.
    288 Derwwatives and Integrals
    
    The number c can be evaluated easily: note that
    O = F(a) = g(a) +c,
    
    so c = —g(a); thus
    F(x) = g(x) — g(a).
    
    This is true, in particular, for x = b. Thus
    
    b
    | f = F(b) = g(b) — g(a). I
    
    The proof of this corollary tends, at first sight, to make the corollary seem useless:
    after all, what good is it to know that
    
    b
    | f = g(b) — g(a)
    
    if g is, for example, g(x) = f. f ? The point, of course, is that one might happen
    to know a quite different function g with this property. For example, if
    x?
    g(x) = z and f(x)= x,
    then g'(x) = f(x) so we obtain, without ever computing lower and upper sums:

    The problem of computing this integral is discussed later, but it provides a good  
    opportunity to warn against a serious error. The conclusion of Corollary | is often  
    
    confused with the definition of integrals—many students think that tr f 1s defined  
    as: "g(b) — g(a), where g is a function whose derivative is f." This "definition" 1s  
    not only wrong—it is useless. One reason is that a function f may be integrable  
    without being the derivative of another function. For example, if f(x) = 0 for  
    x #1 and f(1) = I, then f 1s integrable, but f cannot be a derivative (why noty?).  
    There is also another reason that is much more important: If f 1s continuous,
  - |-
    The corollary to Theorem | is so useful that it is frequently called the Second  
    Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In this book, that name is reserved for a  
    somewhat stronger result (which in practice, however, is not much more useful).  
    As we have just mentioned, a function f might be of the form g' even if f is not  
    continuous. If f is integrable, then it is still true that
    
    b
    ∫ f = g(b) — g(a).
    
    The proof, however, must be entirely different—we cannot use ‘Theorem 1, so we  
    must return to the definition of integrals.
    
    THEOREM 2 (THE SECOND FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS)  
    If f is integrable on [a,b] and f = g' for some function g, then
    
    b
    ∫ f = g(b) — g(a).
    
    PROOF Let P = {x0, ..., xn} be any partition of [a, b]. By the Mean Value Theorem there  
    is a point xi in [xi-1, xi] such that
    
    g(xi) — g(xi-1) = f (xi) (xi — xi-1)  
    = f (xi) (xi — xi-1).
    
    If
    
    m_i = inf{ f(x): x_{i-1} <x < x_i},  
    M_i = sup{f(x):x_{i-1} <x < x_i},
    
    then clearly  
    m_i (x_i —x_{i-1}) < ∫_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} f(x) dx < M_i (x_i —x_{i-1}),
    
    that is,  
    m_i (x_i —x_{i-1}) ≤ g(xi) —g(xi-1) < M_i (x_i —x_{i-1}).
    
    Adding these equations for i = 1, ..., n we obtain  
    ∑ m_i (x_i —x_{i-1}) ≤ g(b) —g(a) < ∑ M_i (x_i —x_{i-1}).
    
    So  
    L(f, P) < g(b) —g(a) < U(f, P)
    
    for every partition P. But this means that
    
    b
    g(b) —g(a) = ∫ f.

    We have already used the corollary to Theorem 1 (or, equivalently, Theorem 2)  
    to find the integrals of a few elementary functions:

      FICURE 2 Similar care must be exercised in finding the areas of regions which are bounded

      by the graphs of more than one function—a problem which may frequently involve
      considerable ingenuity in any case. Suppose, to take a simple example first, that
      we wish to find the area of the region, shown in Figure 3, between the graphs of
      the functions

      f(x) =x? and g(x) =x?

      on the interval [0, 1]. If 0 < x < 1, then 0 < x3 < x, so that the graph of g hies
      below that of f. The area of the region of interest to us 1s therefore

      area R(f,0, 1)— area R(g,0, 1),

      This area could have been expressed as

      If g(x) < f(x) for all x in [a, b], then this integral always gives the area bounded
      by f and g, even if f and g are sometimes negative. ‘Vhe easicst way to see this is shown
      in Figure 4. If c isa number such that f +c and g+c are nonnegative on [a. 5],
      BIG eR 3 then the region Rj, bounded by f and g, has the same area as the region Ro,

      bounded by the graphs of

      f= x>—x and g(x) = x'.
      The first necessity 1s to determine this region more precisely. The graphs of f

      and g intersect when

      On the interval ({1 — V5 |/2, 0) we have x? — x > x* and on the interval

      (O, [1 + V5 ]/2) we have x2 > x3 — x. These assertions are apparent from the
      graphs (Figure 5), but they can also be checked easily, as follows. Since f(x) = g(x)

      only if x = O, [I+ V5] /2, or [1 — V5 1/2, the function f — g does not change sign
      on the intervals ({1 — V/5]/2, QO) and (0, [1+ V5 ]/2); it is therefore only necessary

      to observe, for example, that

      As this example reveals, one of the major problems involved in finding the areas of a region may be the exact determination of the region. There are, however, more substantial problems of a logical nature—we have thus far defined the areas of some very special regions only, which do not even include some of the regions whose areas have just been computed! We have simply assumed that area makes sense for these regions, and that certain reasonable properties of "area" do hold. These remarks are not meant to suggest that you should regard exercising ingenuity to compute areas as beneath you, but are meant to indicate that a better approach to the definition of area is available, although its proper place is somewhere in advanced calculus. The desire to define area was the motivation, both in this book and historically, for the definition of the integral, but the integral does not really provide the best method of defining areas, although it is frequently the proper tool for computing them.

      It may be discouraging to learn that integrals are not suitable for the very purpose for which they were invented, but we will soon see how essential they are for other purposes. The most important use of integrals has already been emphasized: if f is continuous, the integral provides a function y such that

      y (x) = f(x).

      This equation is the simplest example of a "differential equation" (an equation for a function y which involves derivatives of y). The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that this differential equation has a solution, if f is continuous. In succeeding chapters, and in various problems, we will solve more complicated equations, but the solution almost always depends somehow on the integral; in order to solve a differential equation it is necessary to construct a new function, and the integral is one of the best ways of doing this.

      Since the differentiable functions provided by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus will play such a prominent role in later work, it is very important to realize that these functions may be combined, like less esoteric functions, to yield still more functions, whose derivatives can be found by the Chain Rule.

      As these examples reveal, the expression occurring above (or below) the integral sign indicates the function which will appear on the right when f is written as a composition. As a final example, consider the triple compositions

      which can be written
      $$
      f = F \circ G \circ H \quad \text{and} \quad g = F \circ G \circ F.
      $$

      Omitting the intermediate steps (which you may supply, if you still feel insecure),
      we obtain

      $$
      f'(x) = \frac{e^{x}}{1 + \sin^2 x}, \quad g'(x) = \frac{e^{x}}{1 + \sin^2 x}.
      $$

      $$
      g'(x) = \frac{e^{x}}{1 + \sin^2 x}.
      $$

      Like the simpler differentiations of Chapter 10, these manipulations should become much easier after the practice provided by some of the problems, and, like the problems of Chapter 10, these differentiations are simply a test of your understanding of the Chain Rule, in the somewhat unfamiliar context provided by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

      The powerful uses to which the integral will be put in the following chapters all depend on the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, yet the proof of that theorem was quite easy—it seems that all the real work went into the definition of the integral. Actually, this is not quite true. In order to apply Theorem 1 to a continuous function we need to know that if f is continuous on [a, b], then f is integrable on [a, b]. Although we've already offered one proof of this result, there

      will both exist, even if f is not integrable. These numbers are called the lower
      integral of f on [a,b] and the upper integral of f on [a, b], respectively, and

      will be denoted by
      $$
      \int_a^b f \, dx \quad \text{and} \quad \int_a^b f \, dx.
      $$

      The lower and upper integrals both have several properties which the integral
      possesses. In particular, if $ a <c < b $, then

      $$
      L_f(a,b) = L_f(a,c) + L_f(c,b) \quad \text{and} \quad U_f(a,b) = U_f(a,c) + U_f(c,b)
      $$

      and if $ m < f(x) < M $ for all x in [a, b], then
      $$
      m(b - a) \leq L_f(a,b) \leq U_f(a,b) \leq M(b - a)
      $$

      The proofs of these facts are left as an exercise, since they are quite similar to the
      corresponding proofs for integrals. 'The results for integrals are actually a corollary
      of the results for upper and lower integrals, because f is integrable precisely when

      $$
      L_f = U_f
      $$

      We will prove that a continuous function f is integrable by showing that this
      equality always holds for continuous functions. It is actually easier to show that

      $$
      L_f \leq U_f
      $$

      for all x in [a,b]; the trick is to note that most of the proof of 'Theorem 1 didn't
      even depend on the fact that f was integrable!

      If f is continuous on [a, b], then f is integrable on [a, b].

      Define functions L and U on [a, b] by

      $$
      L(x) = L_f \quad \text{and} \quad U(x)= U_f.
      $$

      Let x be in (a,b). If h > 0 and

      $$
      m_1 = \inf\{f(t):x <t<x +h\}, \quad M_1 = \sup\{f(t):x <t<x +h\},
      $$

      then
      $$
      \frac{m_1 h}{h} \leq L_f \leq \frac{M_1 h}{h},
      $$
      so
      $$
      m_1 h \leq L_f \leq M_1 h.
      $$

      Therefore,
      $$
      m_1 h \leq L(x + h) - L(x) \leq U(x + h) - U(x) \leq M_1 h.
      $$

      Thus,
      $$
      m_1 < \frac{L(x + h) - L(x)}{h} < M_1.
      $$

      If $ h < 0 $ and

      $$
      m_1 = \inf\{f(t):x +h <t <x\}, \quad M_1 = \sup\{f(t):x +h <t <x\},
      $$

      one obtains the same inequality, precisely as in the proof of Theorem 1.
      Since f is continuous at x, we have

      lim mp = lim Mp = f(x),
      and this proves that

      L'(x) = U'(x) = f(x) for x in (a,b).
      This means that there is a number c such that

      U(x) = L(x)+c for all x in [a, Dd).

      Since
      U(a) = L(a) = 0,

      the number c must equal 0, so
      U(x) = L(x) for all x in [a, dD].

      In particular,

      u/ f =U(b)=L6)=L | f,

      CHAPTER THE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
      - |-
      The definitions of the functions sin and cos are considerably more subtle than one might suspect. For this reason, this chapter begins with some informal and intuitive definitions, which should not be scrutinized too carefully, as they shall soon be replaced by the formal definitions which we really intend to use.

      In elementary geometry an angle is simply the union of two half-lines with a common initial point (Figure 1).

      More useful for trigonometry are "directed angles," which may be regarded as pairs (J), /2) of half-lines with the same initial point, visualized as in Figure 2.

      The sine and cosine of a directed angle can now be defined as follows (Figure 5):
      a directed angle is determined by a point (x, y) with x* + y? = 1; the sine of the
      angle is defined as y, and the cosine as x.
      - |-
      Despite the aura of precision surrounding the previous paragraph, we are not yet finished with the definitions of sin and cos. Indeed, we have barely begun. What we have defined is the sine and cosine of a directed angle; what we want to define is sinx and cosx for each number x. The usual procedure for doing this depends on associating an angle to every number. The oldest method is to "measure angles in degrees." An angle "all the way around" is associated to 360, an angle "half-way around" is associated to 180, an angle "a quarter way around" to 90, etc. (Figure 6). The angle associated, in this manner, to the number x, is called "the angle of x degrees." 'The angle of 0 degrees is the same as the angle of 360 degrees, and this ambiguity is purposely extended further, so that an angle of 90 degrees is also an angle of 360 + 90 degrees, etc. One can now define a function, which we will denote by sin', as follows:

      sin' (x) = sine of the angle of x degrees.

      There are two difficulties with this approach. Although it may be clear what we mean by an angle of 90 or 45 degrees, it is not quite clear what an angle of √2 degrees is, for example. Even if this difficulty could be circumvented, it is unlikely that this system, depending as it does on the arbitrary choice of 360, will lead to elegant results—it would be sheer luck if the function sin' had mathematically pleasing properties.

      "Radian measure" appears to offer a remedy for both these defects. Given any number x, choose a point P on the unit circle such that x is the length of the arc of the circle beginning at (1, 0) and running counterclockwise to P (Figure 7). The directed angle determined by P is called "the angle of x radians." Since the length of the whole circle is 2π, the angle of x radians and the angle of 2π + x radians are identical. A function sin' can now be defined as follows:

      sin' (x) = sine of the angle of x radians.
      - |-
      This same method can easily be adopted to define sin"; since we want to have
      sin' 360 = sin' 27, we can define

      - O r
      sn xX =sm =—,— =-sinNn —_=

      360 180°

      We shall soon drop the superscript r in sin', since sin" (and not sin*) is the only
      function which will interest us; before we do, a few words of warning are advisable.
      The expressions sin® x and sin" x are sometimes written

      sin x°
      sin x radians,

      but this notation is quite misleading; a number x is simply a number—it does not
      carry a banner indicating that it is "in degrees" or "in radians." If the meaning

      of the notation "sin x" is in doubt one usually asks:
      "Is x in degrees or radians?"

      but what one means Is:

      "Do you mean ‘sin' or ‘sin''?"
      Even for mathematicians, addicted to precision, these remarks might be dispens-
      able, were it not for the fact that failure to take them into account will lead to
      incorrect answers to certain problems (an example is given in Problem 19).
      Although the function sin" is the function which we wish to denote simply by sin
      (and use exclusively henceforth), there is a difficulty involved even in the definition
      of sin'. Our proposed definition depends on the concept of the length of a curve.
      Although the length of a curve has been defined in several problems, it is also easy
      to reformulate the definition in terms of areas. (A treatment in terms of length is
      outlined in Problem 28.)

      Suppose that x is the length of the arc of the unit circle from (1, 0) to P; this arc
      thus contains x/27 of the total length 27 of the circumference of the unit circle.
      Let S denote the "sector" shown in Figure 8; S is bounded by the unit circle, the
      horizontal axis, and the half-line through (0,0) and P. The area of S should be
      x /2m times the area inside the unit circle, which we expect to be z; thus S should

      have area
      x x

      a T= 5
      We can therefore define cosx and sinx as the coordinates of the point P which
      determines a sector of area x/2.

      With these remarks as background, the rigorous definition of the functions sin
      and cos now begins. The first definition identifies z as the area of the unit circle—
      more precisely, as twice the area of a semicircle (Figure 9).

      The second definition is meant to describe, for —1 < x < 1, the area A(x) of
      the sector bounded by the unit circle, the horizontal axis, and the half-line through
      (x, V1 —x2). If O < x <1, this area can be expressed (Figure 10) as the sum of

      This definition actually requires a few words of justification. In order to know  
      that there zs a number y satisfying A(y) = x/2, we use the fact that A is continuous,  
      and that A takes on the values 0 and 2/2. This tacit appeal to the Intermediate  
      Value Theorem 1s crucial, if we want to make our preliminary definition precise.  
      Having made, and justified, our definition, we can now proceed quite rapidly.

      The values of sinx and cosx for x not in [0,2] are most easily defined by a
      two-step piecing together process:

      (1) If mw <x < 2m, then

      sinx = —sin(27 — x),

      cosx = cos(27 — x).

      Figure 16 shows the graphs of sin and cos on [0, 277].

      If x = 27k + x' for some integer k, and some x' in [0, 27], then
      sinx = sinx,
      COSX = COS xX'.

      Figure 17 shows the graphs of sin and cos, now defined on all of R.

      The inverses of the trigonometric functions are also easily differentiated. The
      trigonometric functions are not one-one, so it is first necessary to restrict them
      to suitable intervals; the largest possible length obtainable is π, and the intervals
      usually chosen are (Figure 19)

      [−π/2, π/2] for sin,
      [0, π] for cos,
      (−π/2, π/2) for tan.

      (The inverses of the other trigonometric functions are so rarely used that they will
      not even be discussed here.)
      The inverse of the function

      f(x) = sinx, −π/2 < x < π/2

      is denoted by arcsin (Figure 20); the domain of arcsin is [−1, 1]. The notation
      sin⁻¹ has been avoided because arcsin is not the inverse of sin (which is not one-
      one), but of the restricted function f; sometimes this function f is denoted by Sin,

      and arcsin by Sin⁻¹.

      and the "addition formula"
      sin(x + y) = sinx cos y+ cosx sin y.

      Both of these formulas can be derived easily now that the derivative of sin and cos
      are known. The first is just the special case sin'(0) = cos0. The second depends
      on a beautiful characterization of the functions sin and cos. In order to derive this
      result we need a lemma whose proof involves a clever trick; a more straightforward

      proof will be supplied in Part IV.

      Suppose f has a second derivative everywhere and that

      f" +f =0.
      f(0) =0.
      f'0) =0.

      Then f = 0.

      Multiplying both sides of the first equation by ff' yields
      fifo + ff' — 0.
      Thus
      [FY + FY = 20F'f" + ff') = 0,

      so (f')* + f is a constant function. From f(0) = 0 and f'(0) = 0 it follows that
      the constant 1s 0; thus

      (f(x) 2 +[f@)]? =0 for all x.

      This implies that
      f(x) =0 for all x. J

      If f has a second derivative everywhere and

      f(O) =a,
      f'(0) = 5,

      then

      f =b-snm+a-cos.

      (In particular, if f(O) = Oand f'(0) = 1, then f = sin; if f(O) = | and f'(0) = 0,
      then f = cos.)

      which shows that  
      O = g(x) = f(x) — bsinx — acosx, for all x.  

      THEOREM 5 If x and y are any two numbers, then  
      sin(x + y) = sinxcosy + cosx siny,  

      cos(x + y) = cosx cosy — sinx siny.  

      PROOF _ For any particular number y we can define a function f by  

      f(x) = sin(x + y).  

      Then  
      f'(x) = cos(x + y)  
      f" (x) = —sin(x + y).  
      Consequently,  
      f' + f = 0,  
      f(0) = sin y,  
      f'(0) = cos y.  

      It follows from Theorem 4 that  
      f = (cos y) - sin + (sin y) - cos;  

      that is,  
      sin(x + y) = cos y sinx + sin y cos x, for all x.  

      Since any number y could have been chosen to begin with, this proves the first  
      formula for all x and y.  
      The second formula is proved similarly. J  

      As a conclusion to this chapter, and as a prelude to Chapter 18, we will mention  
      an alternative approach to the definition of the function sin. Since  

      arcsin (x) = for —-Il <x <l,  
      l— x2  

      it follows from the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that  

      |  
      3 dt.  

      This equation could have been taken as the definition of arcsin. It would follow  
      immediately that  

      X  
      arcsin x X = arcsin x — arcsin 0 = |  
      0  

      I e  
      J1—x2  

      the function sin could then be defined as (arcsin)~! and the formula for the deriva-  
      tive of an inverse function would show that  

      arcsin (x) =  
      sin' (x) = V1 — sin' x,

      which could be defined as cos x. Eventually, one could show that A(cosx) = x/2,
      recovering at the very end of the development the definition with which we started.
      Whue much of this presentation would proceed more rapidly, the definition would
      be utterly unmotivated; the reasonableness of the definitions would be known to
      the author, but not to the student, for whom it was intended! Nevertheless, as
      we shall see in Chapter 18, an approach of this sort is sometimes very reasonable

      tained using only a picture of the graph of sin. Indeed, pure thought
      is your only hope in this problem, because determining the sign of the
      derivative f'(x) = cos(x*)-2x is no easier than determining the behavior
      of f directly. The formula for f'(x) does indicate one important fact,
      however— f'(O) = 0, which must be true since f is even, and which
      should be clear in your graph.)
      f(x) = sinx + sin2x. (It will probably be instructive to first draw the
      graphs of g(x) = sinx and h(x) = sin2x carefully on the same set of
      axes, from 0 to 27, and guess what the sum will look like. You can
      easily find out how many critical points f has on [0, 27] by considering
      the derivative of f. You can then determine the nature of these critical
      points by finding out the sign of f at each point; your sketch will probably
      suggest the answer.)

      This short chapter, diverging from the main stream of the book, is included to demonstrate that we are already in a position to do some sophisticated mathematics. This entire chapter is devoted to an elementary proof that z is irrational. Like many "elementary" proofs of deep theorems, the motivation for many steps in our proof cannot be supplied; nevertheless, it is still quite possible to follow the proof step-by-step.

      Two observations must be made before the proof. The first concerns the function

      x^n(1—x)^n
      n!

      fn (x) = ————

      which clearly satisfies

      0 < fn(x) < — for 0 < x < 1.
      n!

      An important property of the function fn is revealed by considering the expression obtained by actually multiplying out x^n(1 —x)^n. The lowest power of x appearing will be n and the highest power will be 2n. Thus fn can be written in the form

      2n
      fn(x) = — Σ cix^i
      n! i=n

      where the numbers c_i are integers. It is clear from this expression that

      fn^(k)(0) = 0 if k < n or k > 2n.

      Moreover,

      fn^(n)(x) = C_n + terms involving x
      n! 

      fn^(n+1)(x) = -[(n + 1)!c_{n+1} + terms involving x]
      n!

      fn^(2n)(x) = (2n)!c_{2n}.

      This means that

      fn^(k)(0) = c_n if k = n,
      fn^(k)(0) = (n + 1)!c_{n+1} if k = n + 1,

      fn^(k)(0) = (2n)(2n — 1)...(2n - k + 1)c_{2n} if k = 2n,

      where the numbers on the right are all integers. Thus fn^(k)(0) is an integer for all k.

      The relation

      fn(x) = (-1)^n fn(1 - x)

      implies that
      fn^(k)(A) is also an integer for all k.

      The proof that z is irrational requires one further observation: if a is any positive number, and ε > 0, then for sufficiently large n we will have

      a^n < ε,
      n!
      - |-
      To prove this, notice that if n > 2a, then

      $$
      \frac{(n + 1)!}{n!} < \frac{2^n}{n!}
      $$

      Now let $ n $ be any natural number with $ n > 2a $. Then, whatever value

      $$
      \frac{(n + 1)!}{n!}
      $$

      may have, the succeeding values satisfy

      $$
      \frac{(n + 1)!}{n!} < \frac{2^n}{n!}
      $$

      $$
      \frac{(n + 2)!}{(n + 1)!} < \frac{2^{n+1}}{(n + 1)!}
      $$

      $$
      \frac{(n + k)!}{(n + k - 1)!} < \frac{2^{n+k}}{(n + k - 1)!}
      $$

      If $ k $ is so large that

      $$
      \frac{(n + k)!}{(n + k - 1)!} < \frac{2^k}{(n + k - 1)!}
      $$

      then

      $$
      \frac{(n + k)!}{(n + k - 1)!} < \frac{2^k}{(n + k - 1)!}
      $$

      which is the desired result. Having made these observations, we are ready for the
      one theorem in this chapter.

      The number $ \pi $ is irrational; in fact, $ e $ is irrational. (Notice that the irrationality

      of $ e $ implies the irrationality of $ \pi $, for if $ \pi $ were rational, then $ e $ certainly would

      be.)

      Suppose $ \pi $

      $$
      = \frac{a}{b}
      $$

      for some positive integers $ a $ and $ b $. Let

      (1) $ G(x) = b^2[2x f(x) - \pi^2 f'(x) + \frac{\pi^2}{2} f''(x)] $

      Notice that each of the factors

      $$
      n_2^n - 2k __ p_n 2^{n-k} - p_n (4^n - n - k)y^k
      $$

      is an integer. Since $ f^{(n)}(0) $ and $ f^{(n)}(1) $ are integers, this shows that
      $ G(0) $ and $ G(1) $ are integers.

      Differentiating $ G $ twice yields

      $$
      2) G(x) = b^2[2x f'(x) - \pi^2 f''(x) + \frac{\pi^2}{2} f'''(x)]
      $$

      The last term, $ (-1)^n f^{(n)}(x) $, is zero. Thus, adding (1) and (2) gives
      - |-
      (3) G" (x) + 27G(x) = b'n7"** f(x) = 17a" fy(x).

      Now let
      H(x) = G'(x)sinax — mG(x)cosxx.

      Then

      H'(x) = rG'(x) cosax + G(x) sinax — 1G' (x) cosmx +2°G(x) sin rx
      = [G"(x) +2°G(x)] sinax
      = 7a" f,(x)sinwx, by (3).

      = G(1)sinaz — 2G(1)cosx — G'(0) sin0 + 2 G(0) cosO

      But this is absurd, because the integral is an integer, and there is no integer between
      0 and 1. Thus our original assumption must have been incorrect: 7? is irrational. J

      This proof is admittedly mysterious; perhaps most mysterious of all is the way
      that a enters the proof—t almost looks as if we have proved z irrational without
      ever mentioning a definition of 2. A close reexamination of the proof will show
      that precisely one property of 2 1s essential—

      sin(z) = 0.
      - |-
      The proof really depends on the properties of the function sin, and proves the irrationality of the smallest positive number x with sinx = Q. In fact, very few properties of sin are required, namely,

      sin' = cos,

      cos = —sin,
      sin(O) = O,
      cos(O) = 1.

      Even this list could be shortened; as far as the proof is concerned, cos might just as well be defined as sin'. The properties of sin required in the proof may then be written

      sin' + sin = 0,
      sin(Q) = QO,
      sin (0) = 1.

      Of course, this is not really very surprising at all, since, as we have seen in the previous chapter, these properties characterize the function sin completely.

      PROBLEMS

      1. (a) For the areas of triangles OAB and OAC in Figure 1, with ∠AOB < π/4,
      show that we have
      $$
      \text{area OAC} = \frac{1}{2} + \int_0^1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} \, dx
      $$
      area OAB = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} \, dx

      Hint: Solve the equations xy = 2(area OAB), x^2 + y^2 = 1, for y.

      (b) Let P_m be the regular polygon of m sides inscribed in the unit circle. If
      A_m is the area of P_m, show that

      $$
      A_m = \pi - 2\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{2A_m}{m}\right)^2}.
      $$

      This result allows one to obtain (more and more complicated) expressions
      for A_m, starting with A_1 = 2, and thus to compute π as accurately
      as desired (according to Problem 8-11). Although better methods will
      appear in Chapter 20, a slight variant of this approach yields a very
      interesting expression for π:

      $$
      \text{area}(OAB) = \frac{1}{2} OB,

      $$

      show that if d_m is the distance from O to one side of P_m, then
      $$
      d_m = \frac{2A_m}{m}.

      CHAPTER

      PLANETARY MOTION

      Nature and Nature's Laws lay hid in night
      God said "Let Newton be," and all was light.

      Alexander Pope

      Unlike Chapter 16, a short chapter diverging from the main stream of the book,
      this long chapter diverges from the main stream of the book to demonstrate that
      we are already in a position to do some real physics.

      In 1609 Kepler published his first two laws of planetary motion. The first law
      describes the shape of planetary orbits:

      The planets move in ellipses, with the sun at one focus.

      The second law involves the area swept out by the segment from the sun to the
      planet (the ‘radius vector from the sun to the planet') in various time intervals

      (Figure 1):

      Equal areas are swept out by the radius vector in equal times. (Equivalently, the area
      swept out in time t 1s proportional to t.)

      Kepler's third law, published in 1619, relates the motions of different planets. If a
      is the major axis of a planet's elliptical orbit and T 1s its period, the time it takes
      the planet to return to a given position, then:

      The ratio a> /T* is the same for all planets.
      - |-
      Newton's great accomplishment was to show (using his general law that the  
      force on a body is its mass times its acceleration) that Kepler's laws follow from the  
      assumption that the planets are attracted to the sun by a force (the gravitational  
      force of the sun) always directed toward the sun, proportional to the mass of the  
      planet, and satisfying an inverse square law; that is, by a force directed toward  
      the sun whose magnitude varies inversely with the square of the distance from the  
      sun to the planet and directly with the mass of the planet. Since force is mass  
      times acceleration, this is equivalent simply to saying that the magnitude of the  
      acceleration is a constant divided by the square of the distance from the sun.

      Newton's analysis actually established three results that correlate with Kepler's  
      individual laws. The first of Newton's results concerns Kepler's second law (which  
      was actually discovered first, nicely preserving the symmetry of the situation):

      17. Planetary Motion 331

      Kepler's second law holds true precisely for ‘central forces', that is, if and only if the force between  
      the sun and the planet always lies along the line between the sun and the planet.

      Although Newton is revered as the discoverer of calculus, and indeed invented  
      calculus precisely in order to treat such problems, his derivation hardly seems to  
      use calculus at all. Instead of considering a force that varies continuously as the  
      planet moves, Newton first considers short equal time intervals and assumes that  
      a momentary force is exerted at the ends of each of these intervals.

      ‘To be specific, let us imagine that during the first time interval the planet moves  
      along the line P1P2, with uniform velocity (Figure 2a). If, during the next equal  
      time interval, the planet continued to move along this line, it would end up at  
      P3, where the length of P1P2 equals the length of P2P3. ‘This would imply that  
      the triangle SP1P2 has the same area as the triangle SP2P3 (since they have equal  
      bases, and the same height)—this just says that Kepler's law holds in the special  
      case where the force is 0.
      - |-
      Now suppose (Figure 2b) that at the moment the planet arrives at P2 it experi-
      ences a force exerted along the line from S to Pz, which by itself would cause the planet
      to move to the pot Q. Combined with the motion that the planet already has,
      this causes the planet to move to R, the vertex opposite P) in the parallelogram
      whose sides are P> P3 and PoQ.

      Thus, the area swept out in the second time interval is actually the triangle
      SPR. But the area of triangle SP)R is equal to the area of triangle SP3 P , since
      they have the same base SP, and the same heights (since R P3 1s parallel to SP).
      Hence, finally, the area of triangle SP)R is the same as the area of the original
      triangle SP; P2! Conversely, if the triangle SRP 2 has the same area as SP; P2, and
      hence the same area as SP3P2, then RP3 must be parallel to SP), and this implies
      that Q must lie along SP.

      Of course, this isn't quite the sort of argument one would expect to find in a
      modern book, but in its own charming way it shows physically just why the result
      should be true.

      To analyze planetary motion we will be using the material in the Appendix to
      Chapter 12, and the "determinant" det defined in Problem 4 of Appendix | to
      Chapter 4. We describe the motion of the planet by the parameterized curve

      c(t) = r(t)(cos @(t), sin O(t)),

      so that r always gives the length of the line from the sun to the planet, while 6
      gives the angle, which we will assume is increasing (the case where @ 1s decreasing
      then follows easily). It will be convenient to write this also as

      (1) c(t) =r(t)- e(@(t)),

      where
      e(t) = (cost, sin fr)

      is Just the parameterized curve that runs along the unit circle. Note that

      e'(t) = (—sinf, cost)

      is also a vector of unit length, but perpendicular to e(t), and that we also have  
      (2) det(e(t), e'(t)) = 1.  

      Differentiating (1), using the formulas on page 247, we obtain  
      (3) c(t) = r'(t) - e@(2)) + r()6"(t) - e'((4)),  

      and combining with (1), together with the formulas in Problem 6 of Appendix 1  
      to Chapter 4, we get  

      det(c(t), c'(t)) = r(t)r'(t) det(e(O(r)), e(@(t))) + r(t)°0'(t) det(e(@(z)), e'(8(t)))  
      = r(t)6'(t) det(e(@(t)), e'(A(t))),  
      since det(v, v) is always 0. Using (2) we then get  
      (4) det(c, c') = 76'.  

      As we will see, r76' turns out to have another important interpretation.  

      Suppose that A(t) is the area swept out from time 0 to ¢ (Figure 3). We want  
      to get a formula for A'(t), and, in the spirit of Newton, we'll begin by making  
      an educated guess. Figure 4 shows A(t +h) — A(t), together with a straight line  
      segment between c(t) and c(t +h). It is easy to write down a formula for the area  
      of the triangle A(h) with vertices O, c(t), and c(t +h): according to Problems 4  
      and 5 of Appendix 1 to Chapter 4, the area is  

      area(A(h)) = 5 det(c(t), c(t + h) — c(t)).  

      Since the triangle A(h) has practically the same area as the region A(t+h) — A(t),  
      this shows (or practically shows) that  

      A(t+h)—-—A(t  
      A(t) = lim (ti +n) (it)

      = det (ca lim SUF A) et ')  
      h-0 h  

      = } det(c(t), c/(t)).
      - |-
      A rigorous derivation, establishing more in the process, can be made using Problem 13-24, which gives a formula for the area of a region determined by the graph of a function in polar coordinates. According to this Problem, we can write

      $$
      A(t) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{\theta_0}^{\theta(t)} r(\theta) \, d\theta
      $$

      if our parameterized curve $ c(t) = r(t) \, e^{i\theta(t)} $ is the graph of the function $ r $ in polar coordinates (here we've used $ \theta $ for the angular polar coordinate, to avoid confusion with the function $ \theta $ used to describe the curve $ c $).
      $$
      \text{THEOREM 1}
      $$

      $$
      \text{PROOF}
      $$

      17. Planetary Motion 333

      Now the function $ \theta $ is just

      $$
      \theta(t) = \theta(r(t))
      $$

      [for any particular angle $ \theta $, $ t $ is the time at which the curve $ c $ has angular polar coordinate $ \theta $, so $ r(\theta(t)) $ is the radius coordinate corresponding to $ \theta $]. Although the presence of the inverse function might look a bit forbidding, it's actually quite innocent: Applying the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Chain Rule to (*) we immediately get

      $$
      A(t) = \frac{1}{2} r(\theta(t))^2 \cdot \frac{d\theta}{dt}
      = \frac{1}{2} r(t)^2 \cdot \theta'(t), \text{ since } r = r(\theta)
      $$

      Briefly,
      $$
      A' = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta'.
      $$

      Combining with (4), we thus have

      (5) $ A' = \frac{1}{2} \det(c, c') = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta' $. 

      Now we're ready to consider Kepler's second law. Notice that Kepler's second law is equivalent to saying that $ A' $ is constant, and thus it is equivalent to $ A'' = 0 $. But

      $$
      A'' = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} \det(c, c') \right) = \frac{1}{2} \det(c', c'') + \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{1}{2} \det(c, c') \right) \text{ (see page 248)}
      $$

      $$
      - \frac{1}{2} \det(c, c'').
      $$

      So

      Kepler's second law is equivalent to $ \det(c, c'') = 0 $.

      Putting this all together we have:

      Kepler's second law is true if and only if the force is central, and in this case each planetary path $ c(t) = r(t) \, e^{i\theta(t)} $ satisfies the equation

      $$
      (r^2 \theta') = \det(c, c') = \text{constant}. 
      $$

      Saying that the force is central just means that it always points along c(t). Since
      c'(t) is in the direction of the force, that is equivalent to saying that c'(t) always
      points along c(t). And this is equivalent to saying that we always have

      det(c, c") = 0.

      We've just seen that this is equivalent to Kepler's second law.

      Moreover, this equation implies that | det(c, c')| = 0, which by (5) gives (K2). J

      PROOF

      NADY

      FIGURE 5

      Newton next showed that if the gravitational force of the sun is a central force
      and also satisfies an inverse square law, then the path of any object in it will be a
      conic section having the sun at one focus. Planets, of course, correspond to the
      case where the conic section is an ellipse, and this is also true for comets that visit
      the sun periodically; parabolas and hyperbolas represent objects that come from
      outside the solar system, and eventually continue on their merry way back outside
      the system.

      If the gravitational force of the sun is a central force that satisfies an inverse square
      law, then the path of any body in it will be a conic section having the sun at one
      focus (more precisely, either an ellipse, parabola, or one branch of an hyperbola).
      - |-
      Notice that our conclusion specifies the shape of the path, not a particular param-
      eterization. But this parameterization 1s essentially determined by Theorem 1: the
      hypothesis of a central force implies that the area A(t) (Figure 5) 1s proportional
      to t, so determining c(f) is essentially equivalent to determining A for arbitrary
      points on the ellipse. Unfortunately, the areas of such segments cannot be deter-
      mined explicitly.* ‘This means that we have to determine the shape of the path
      c(t) = r(t) -e(@(t)) without finding its parameterization! Since it is the function
      r o@7—! which actually describes the shape of the path in polar coordinates, we

      Notice that the left-hand side of this equation is
      [c' 067 !7/(@(1)).

      So if we let
      D=c'o@7!

      (this is the main trick—‘we consider c' as a function of 6"), then the equation can
      be written as

      H H |
      D'(@(t)) = — u e(@(t)) = — yy (cos 9). sin O(t)),

      * More precisely, we can't write down a solution in terms of familiar "standard functions," like sin,

      rotating our polar coordinate system (choosing which ray corresponds to 0 = QO),

      the last equation in our proof shows that we can rewrite (*) as

      Recall (page 87) that the major axis a of the ellipse is given by

      Remember that equation (5) gives
      A'(t) = 4r°6' = 4M,
      and thus
      A(t) = 5Mt.

      We can therefore interpret M in terms of the period T of the orbit. This period T
      is, by definition, the value of t for which we have 6(t) = 27, so that we obtain the
      complete ellipse. Hence

      area of the ellipse = A(T) = sMT,

      Kepler's third law is true if and only if the accelerations c"(t) of the various planets,  
      moving on ellipses, satisfy

      for a constant G that does not depend on the planet.  

      THEOREM 4  

      PROOF  

      17. Planetary Motion 337  

      It should be mentioned that the converse of ‘Theorem 2' is also true. ‘To prove  
      this, we first want to establish one further consequence of Kepler's second law.  

      Recall that for  

      e(t) = (cosf, sin f)  
      we have  
      e'(t) = (—sint, cosf).  
      Consequently,  
      e'(t) = (—cost, —sint) = —e(f).  

      Now differentiating (3) gives  
      c"(t) =r" (t)-e(O(t)) +r ()O'(£) - e'(A(t))  
      +r'(t)O'(t)-e(O(t)) +r") -e (Ot) +r Qe HO) - e"(O(t)).  
      Using e"(t) = —e(t) we get  
      c(t) = [r'"(@) — r)0'(t)*] - e(6(0)) + [27 (D0'@) + 0" ()] - e'((0)).  

      Since Kepler's second law implies central forces, hence that c"(t) is always a mul-  
      tiple of c(t), and thus always a multiple of e(@(t)), the coefficient of e'(O(t))  
      must be O [as a matter of fact, we can see this directly by taking the derivative of  
      formula (K2)]. Thus Kepler's second law implies that  

      (6) c"(t) = [r(t) — r(t)6'(t)*] - e(6(2)).

      If the path of a planet moving under a central gravitational force lies on a conic section with the sun as focus, then the force must satisfy an inverse square law.

      As in Theorem 2, notice that the hypothesis on the shape of the path, together with the hypothesis of a central force, which is equivalent to Kepler's second law, essentially determines the parameterization. But we can't write down an explicit solution, so we have to obtain information about the acceleration without actually knowing what it is.

      Once again, the hypothesis of a central force implies that

      (K2) r'' = M,

      for some constant M, and the hypothesis that the path lies on a conic section with the sun as focus implies that it satisfies the equation

      (A) r(1 + e cos θ) = A,

      for some ε and A. For our (not especially illuminating) proof, we will keep differentiating and substituting from these two equations.
      First we differentiate (A) to obtain

      r'(1 + e cos θ) - r e' sin θ = 0.
      Multiplying by r this becomes
      rr'(1 + e cos θ) - r e' sin θ = 0.

      Using both (A) and (K2), this becomes
      Ar' - eM sin θ = 0.
      Differentiating again, we get
      Ar'' - εMθ' cos θ = 0.

      Using (K2) we get

      Ar'' - cos θ = 0,

      Comparing with (6), we obtain

      c(t) = - A² e(θ(t)),

      which is precisely what we wanted to show: the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the sun to the planet. J

      R THE LOGARITHM AND
      CHAPTER EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
      - |-
      In Chapter 15 the integral provided a rigorous formulation for a preliminary def-
      inition of the functions sin and cos. In this chapter the integral plays a more
      essential role. For certain functions even a preliminary definition presents difficul-
      ties. For example, consider the function

      f(x) = 10°.
      This function is assumed to be defined for all x and to have an inverse function,
      defined for positive x, which is the "logarithm to the base 10,"
      f'(x) = logy) x.

      In algebra, 10* is usually defined only for rational x, while the definition for 1r-
      rational x is quietly ignored. A brief review of the definition for rational x will
      not only explain this omission, but also recall an important principle behind the

      definition of 10%.

      The symbol 10" is first defined for natural numbers n. This notation turns out
      to be extremely convenient, especially for multiplying very large numbers, because

      10" - 10" = 10"*".

      The extension of the definition of 10* to rational x is motivated by the desire
      to preserve this equation; this requirement actually forces upon us the customary
      definition. Since we want the equation

      10° - 10" = 10°*" = 10"
      to be true, we must define 10° = 1; since we want the equation

      107". 10" = 10° = 1

      to be true, we must define 107" = 1/10"; since we want the equation
      101"... 10" = 10" F1/" = 10! = 10
      sem a,
      n times n times

      to be true, we must define 10!/" = 10; and since we want the equation

      10!/" Loo, 19!/" _ 1Q Wirt +l /n _ 107/"
      a / a
      m times m times

      to be true, we must define 10"/" = (V10)".

      Unfortunately, at this point the program comes to a dead halt. We have been
      guided by the principle that 10* should be defined so as to ensure that 10*** =
      10* 10"; but this principle does not suggest any simple algebraic way of defining

      Here is the corrected and properly formatted text:

      10* for irrational x. For this reason we will try some more sophisticated ways of  
      finding a function f such that

      (*) f(ty) = fx): f(y) for all x and y.

      Of course, we are interested in a function which is not always zero, so we might  
      add the condition f(1) ≠ 0. If we add the more specific condition f(1) = 10,  
      then (*) will imply that f(x) = 10^x for rational x, and 10^x could be defined as f(x)  
      for other x; in general f(x) will equal [f(1)]^x for rational x.

      One way to find such a function is suggested if we try to solve an apparently  
      more difficult problem: find a differentiable function f such that

      f(x + y) = f(x) · f(y) for all x and y,  
      f(1) = 10.

      Assuming that such a function exists, we can try to find f'—knowing the derivative  
      of f might provide a clue to the definition of f itself. Now

      f(x + h) - f(x)  
      f'(x) = lim  
      h→0 h  

      = lim [f(x) · f(h)] / h - f(x)/h  
      = f(x) · lim [f(h)/h] - f(x)/h  

      for the moment assume this limit exists, and denote it by a. Then  
      f(x) = a · f(x) for all x.

      Even if a could be computed, this approach seems self-defeating. The derivative  
      of f has been expressed in terms of f again.

      If we examine the inverse function f^{-1} = log_{10}, the whole situation appears in  
      a new light:

      log_{10}(x) =  

      The derivative of f^{-1} is about as simple as one could ask! And, what is even  
      more interesting, of all the integrals ∫ x^n dx examined previously, the integral  
      ∫ x^{-1} dx is the only one which we cannot evaluate. Since log_{10} 1 = 0 we should  

      have

      ∫_{1}^{x} (1/t) dt = ∫_{1}^{x} log_{10}(t) dt = log_{10}(x)

      reasonable, from a mathematical point of view, than log,y. The usefulness of
      log,g depends on the important role of the number 10 in arabic notation (and thus
      ultimately on the fact that we have ten fingers), while the function log provides a
      notation for an extremely simple integral which cannot be evaluated in terms of

      Theorem 1 provides some important information about the graph of log. The  
      function log is clearly increasing, but since log'(x) = 1/x, the derivative becomes  
      very small as x becomes large, and log consequently grows more and more slowly.  
      It is not immediately clear whether log is bounded or unbounded on R. Observe,  
      however, that for a natural number n,  

      log(2^n) = n log 2 (and log 2 > 0);  
      it follows that log is, in fact, not bounded above. Similarly,  

      log(1 / 2^n) = log(1) - log(2^n) = -n log 2;  
      therefore log is not bounded below on (0,1). Since log is continuous, it actu-  
      ally takes on all values. Therefore R is the domain of the function log^{-1}. This  
      important function has a special name, whose appropriateness will soon become  
      clear.  

      The "exponential function," exp, is defined as log^{-1}.  

      The graph of exp is shown in Figure 2. Since log x is defined only for x > 0, we  
      always have exp(x) > 0. The derivative of the function exp is easy to determine.

      implies that

      exp(x) = [exp(1)]^x
      = e^x, for all rational x.

      Since exp is defined for all x and exp(x) = e^x for rational x, it is consistent with

      attempt. If x is rational, then

      If a > 0, then, for any real number x,

      a^x = e^{x \log a}

      (If a = e this definition clearly agrees with the previous one.)

      The requirement a > 0 is necessary, in order that log_a be defined. This is not
      unduly restrictive since, for example, we would not even expect

      (-1)^{1/2} = \sqrt{-1}

      to be defined. (Of course, for certain rational x, the symbol a^x will make sense,
      according to the old definition; for example,

      (-1)^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{-1} = -1)

      Our definition of a^x was designed to ensure that
      (a^x)^y = a^{xy} for all x and y.

      As we would hope, this equation turns out to be true when e is replaced by any
      number a > 0. The proof is a moderately involved unraveling of terminology. At
      the same time we will prove the other important properties of a^x.

      If a > 0, then
      (1) (a^x)^y = a^{xy} for all x, y.

      (Notice that a^x will automatically be positive, so (a^x)^y will be defined);
      (2) a^{x+y} = a^x \cdot a^y and a^{xy} = (a^x)^y for all x, y.

      (Notice that (2) implies that this definition of a^x agrees with the old one for all
      rational x.)

      f(x) = log, x (a < 1)

      f(x) = l* = 1. Suppose a > 1. In this case loga > 0. Thus,

      if x < y,
      then xloga < yloga,
      so e^x loga < e^y loga
      that is, a^x < a^y.

      Thus the function f(x) = a^x is increasing. On the other hand, if 0 < a < 1,
      so that loga < 0, the same sort of reasoning shows that the function f(x) = a^x
      is decreasing. In either case, if a > 0 and a ≠ 1, then f(x) = a^x is one-to-one.
      Since exp takes on every positive value, it is also easy to see that a^x takes on every
      positive value. Thus the inverse function is defined for all positive numbers, and
      takes on all values. If f(x) = a^x, then f^{-1} is the function usually denoted by log,
      (Figure 5).

      Just as a^x can be expressed in terms of exp, so log_a can be expressed in terms

      of log. Indeed,

      if y = log_a x,
      then x = a^y = e^{y ln a},
      so ln x = y ln a,
      that is, log_a x = (ln x) / (ln a).

      The derivatives of f(x) = a^x and g(x) = log_a x are both easy to find:

      f'(x) = a^x ln a, so f'(x) = ln a * a^x,
      g(x) = 1 / x, so g'(x) = -1 / x^2.

      A more complicated function like  
      f(x) = g(x) log a(x).  
      is also easy to differentiate, if you remember that, by definition,

      f(x) = g(x) log a(x).  

      it follows from the Chain Rule that

      f'(x) = g(x) log a(x) + h(x)  
      — g(x)" ; h(x) og g(x) + noe | ,  

      There is no point in remembering this formula—simply apply the principle behind  
      it in any specific case that arises; it does help, however, to remember that the first  
      factor in the derivative will be g(x)".  

      ---

      THEOREM 5  

      PROOF  

      18. The Logarithm and Exponential Functions 347  

      There is one special case of the above formula which is worth remembering.  
      The function f(x) = x^a was previously defined only for rational a. We can now  
      define and find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^a for any number a; the  
      result is just what we would expect:  

      f(x) = x^a = e^{a log x}  

      SO  

      f'(x) = a \cdot e^{a \log x} \cdot \frac{1}{x} = a \cdot x^{a-1}  

      Algebraic manipulations with the exponential functions will become second na-  
      ture after a little practice—just remember that all the rules which ought to work  
      actually do. The basic properties of exp are still those stated in Theorems 2 and 3:  

      exp(x) = e^x,  
      exp(x + y) = exp(x) \cdot exp(y).  

      In fact, each of these properties comes close to characterizing the function exp.  
      Naturally, exp is not the only function f satisfying f' = f, for if f = c e^x, then  
      f'(x) = c e^x = f(x); these functions are the only ones with this property, however.  

      If f is differentiable and  
      f'(x) = f(x) for all x,  

      then there is a number c such that  
      f(x) = c e^x for all x.  

      Let  
      f(x) = e^x  
      g(x) = \frac{f(x)}{e^x}  

      (This is permissible, since e^x ≠ 0 for all x.) Then  
      \frac{g'(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(x) e^x - f(x) e^x}{(e^x)^2} = 0.  

      Therefore there is a number c such that  
      g(x) = c = c for all x.

      The second basic property of exp requires a more involved discussion. 'The
      function exp is clearly not the only function f which satisfies

      f(x +y) = f(x): f(y).

      In fact, f(x) = 0 or any function of the form f(x) = a" also satisfies this equation.
      But the true story is much more complex than this—there are infinitely many other
      functions which satisfy this property, but it is impossible, without appealing to more
      advanced mathematics, to prove that there is even one function other than those
      348 Derivatives and Integrals

      THEOREM 6

      PROOF

      l
      f= -

      FIGURE 6

      already mentioned! It is for this reason that the definition of 10* is so difficult:
      there are infinitely many functions f which satisfy

      fx+y)= f(x): fO),
      fC) = 10,

      but which are not the function f(x) = 10*! One thing is true however—any
      continuous function f satisfying

      f(x+y)= f(x): fy)

      must be of the form f(x) = a* or f(x) = 0. (Problem 38 indicates the way to
      prove this, and also has a few words to say about discontinuous functions with this
      property.)

      In addition to the two basic properties stated in Theorems 2 and 3, the function
      exp has one further property which is very important—exp "grows faster than any
      polynomial." In other words,

      For any natural number n,

      e~

      lim — = oo.
      x00 x"

      The proof consists of several steps.

      Step 1. e* > x for all x, and consequently lim e* = oo (this may be considered

      to be the case n = 0).
      To prove this statement (which is clear for x < Q) it suffices to show that

      x >logx forall x > 0.

      If x < 1 this is clearly true, since log x < 0. If x > 1, then (Figure 6) x — 1 is an
      upper sum for f(t) = 1/t on [1,x], so logx <x—-—I <x.

      Xx

      Step 2. lim — = 00.

      By Step 1, the expression in parentheses is greater than 1, and lim e*/* = oo; this

      shows that lim e*/x = oo.

      Note that  

      18. The Logarithm and Exponential Functions 349  

      The expression in parentheses becomes arbitrarily large, by Step 2, so the nth  
      power certainly becomes arbitrarily large. J  

      It is now possible to examine carefully the following very interesting function:  
      f(x) = ent? x #0. We have  

      2  
      fey see 5  
      Xx  

      Therefore,  

      f(x) <0 forx <0,  
      f'(x)>0 forx > 0,  

      so f is decreasing for negative x and increasing for positive x. Moreover, if |x| is  

      1/x?  

      large, then x* is large, so —1/x? is close to 0, so e~!/*" is close to 1 (Figure 7).  

      FIGURE 7  

      The behavior of f near O is more interesting. If x is small, then 1 /x* is large,  
      so e!/** is large, so etx" — | /(el/ x*) is small. ‘his argument, suitably stated with  
      e's and 4's, shows that  

      lim e7!/* =0.

      Therefore, if we define  

      _ en Nx" x #0

      then the function f is continuous (Figure 8). In fact, f is actually differentiable

      This argument can be continued. In fact, using induction it can be shown (Prob-  
      lem 40) that f"(0) = O for every k. The function f is extremely flat at 0, and  
      approaches O so quickly that it can mask many irregularities of other functions.

      f(x) = 7 x

      It can be shown (Problem 41) that for this function it is also true that f"(0) = 0  
      for all k. ‘This example shows, perhaps more strikingly than any other, Just how  
      bad a function can be, and still be infinitely differentiable. In Part IV we will  
      investigate even more restrictive conditions on a function, which will finally rule  
      out behavior of this sort.

      If a bank gives a percent interest per annum, then an initial investment / yields 7(1 + a/100) after 1 year. If the bank compounds the interest (counts the accrued interest as part of the capital for computing interest the next year), then the initial investment grows to (1 + a/100)" after n years. Now suppose that interest is given twice a year. The final amount after n years is, alas, not /(1 +a/100)2", but merely /(1 +a /200)*"—although interest is awarded twice as often, the interest must be halved in each calculation, since the interest is a/2 per half year. This amount is larger than 7(1 + a/100)',
      but not that much larger. Suppose that the bank now compounds the interest continuously, i.e., the bank considers what the investment would yield when compounding k times a year, and then takes the least upper bound of all these numbers. How much will an initial investment of | dollar yield after Il year?

      $$ \lim_{h \to 0} (1 + h)^{1/h} $$  
      If we can show that this has a limit $ e $, then $ \log_a (x) = \frac{1}{\log_e a} \ln x $, and consequently $ \exp = \log_a $ has derivative $ \exp'(x) = \exp(x) $.  

      (b) Let $ a_n = (1 + \frac{1}{n})^n $ for natural numbers $ n $. Using the binomial theorem,

      A point P is moving along a line segment AB of length 10' while another
      point Q moves along an infinite ray (Figure 11). The velocity of P is always
      equal to the distance from P to B (in other words, if P(t) is the position of P
      at time t, then P'(t) = 10' − P(t)), while Q moves with constant velocity
      Q'(t) = 10'. The distance traveled by Q after time t is defined to be the
      Napierian logarithm of the distance from P to B at time t. Thus

      10't = Nap log[10' − P(t)].

      This was the definition of logarithms given by Napier (1550-1617) in his
      publication of 1614, "Mirifici logarithmorum canonum" (A Description of
      the Wonderful Law of Logarithms); work which was done before the use of
      exponents was invented! The number 10' was chosen because Napier's ta-
      bles (intended for astronomical and navigational calculations), listed the loga-
      rithms of sines of angles, for which the best possible available tables extended
      to seven decimal places, and Napier wanted to avoid fractions. Prove that

      A more direct approach is illustrated in the next part:

      (c) In Problem 35, Problem 2-22 was deduced as a special case of the inequality

      Let $ f $ and $ g $ be continuous functions such that $ \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} g(x) = \infty $.

      We say that $ f $ grows faster than $ g $ (i.e., $ f > g $) if

      $$
      \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \infty
      $$

      and we say that $ f $ and $ g $ grow at the same rate (i.e., $ f \sim g $) if

      $$
      \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = c
      $$

      where $ c $ is a finite positive number.

      For example, for any polynomial function $ P $ with $ \lim_{x \to \infty} P(x) = \infty $ (i.e., $ P $ is non-constant and has a positive leading coefficient), we have $ e^x > P $ and $ P > \log^n x $ for any positive integer $ n $.

      Given $ f $ and $ g $, with $ \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} g(x) = \infty $, is it necessarily true that one of the three conditions $ f > g $, $ g > f $, or $ f \sim g $ holds?

      If $ f > g $, then $ f + g \sim f $.

      If

      $$
      \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\log f(x)}{\log g(x)} > 1
      $$

      for sufficiently large $ x $, then $ f > g $.

      If $ f > g $ and $ F(x) = \int_0^x f(t) dt $, $ G(x) = \int_0^x g(t) dt $, does it necessarily follow that $ F >> G $?

      This evaluation of ∫ log x dx depended on the lucky guess that log is the derivative of the function F(x) = x(logx)—x. In general, a function F satisfying F' = f
      is called a primitive of f. Of course, a continuous function f always has a

      primitive, namely,
      F(x) = ∫ f(x) dx;

      but in this chapter we will try to find a primitive which can be written in terms of
      familiar functions like sin, log, etc. A function which can be written in this way
      is called an elementary function. "To be precise," an elementary function is
      one which can be obtained by addition, multiplication, division, and composition
      from the rational functions, the trigonometric functions and their inverses, and the
      functions log and exp.

      It should be stated at the very outset that elementary primitives usually cannot
      be found. For example, there is no elementary function F such that

      F'(x) = e^-x for all x

      (this is not merely a report on the present state of mathematical ignorance; it is
      a (difficult) theorem that no such function exists). And, what is even worse, you

      * The definition which we will give is precise, but not really accurate, or at least not quite standard.
      Usually the elementary functions are defined to include "algebraic" functions, that is, functions g
      satisfying an equation

      (g(x))^n + f_{n-1}(x)(g(x))^{n-1} + ... + f_0(x) = 0,

      where the f_j are rational functions. But for our purposes these functions can be ignored.

      We will have no way of knowing whether or not an elementary primitive can be found
      (you will just have to hope that the problems for this chapter contain no misprints).

      This chapter consists of little more than methods for finding elementary prim-
      itives of given elementary functions (a process known simply as "integration'),
      together with some notation, abbreviations, and conventions designed to facilitate
      this procedure. This preoccupation with elementary functions can be justified by
      three considerations:

      (1) Integration is a standard topic in calculus, and everyone should know
      about it.

      (2) Every once in a while you might actually need to evaluate an integral, under
      conditions which do not allow you to consult any of the standard integral
      tables (for example, you might take a (physics) course in which you are
      expected to be able to integrate).

      (3) The most useful "methods" of integration are actually very important the-
      orems (that apply to all functions, not just elementary ones).

      Naturally, the last reason is the crucial one. Even if you intend to forget how
      to integrate (and you probably will forget some details the first time through), you
      must never forget the basic methods.

      These basic methods are theorems which allow us to express primitives of one
      function in terms of primitives of other functions. ‘To begin integrating we will
      therefore need a list of primitives for some functions; such a list can be obtained
      simply by differentiating various well-known functions. The list given below makes
      use of a standard symbol which requires some explanation. The symbol

      means "a primitive of f" or, more precisely, "the collection of all primitives of f."
      The symbol ∫f(x)dx will often be used in stating theorems, while ∫a^b f(x)dx is most
      useful in formulas like the following:

      ∫x³ dx = x⁴/4.

      19. Integration in Elementary Terms 365

      This "equation" means that the function F(x) = x⁴/4 satisfies F'(x) = x³. It
      cannot be interpreted literally because the right side is a number, not a function,
      but in this one context we will allow such discrepancies; our aim is to make the
      integration process as mechanical as possible, and we will resort to any possible
      device. Another feature of the equation deserves mention. Most people write

      ∫x² dx = x³/3
      to emphasize that the primitives of f(x) = x² are precisely the functions of the
      form F(x) = x³/3 + C for some number C. Although it is possible (Problem 14)
      to obtain contradictions if this point is disregarded, in practice such difficulties do
      not arise, and concern for this constant is merely an annoyance.

      There is one important convention accompanying this notation: the letter appearing
      on the right side of the equation should match with the letter appearing after the "d"
      on the left side—thus

      ∫u³ du = u⁴/4,
      ∫x dx = x²/2.

      A function in ∫f(x)dx, i.e., a primitive of f, is often called an "indefinite
      integral" of f, while ∫a^b f(x)dx is called, by way of contrast, a "definite integral."
      This suggestive notation works out quite well in practice, but it is important not to
      be led astray. At the risk of boring you, the following fact is emphasized once again:
      the integral ∫f(x)dx is not defined as "F(b) − F(a), where F is an indefinite
      integral of f" (if you do not find this statement repetitious, it is time to reread
      Chapter 13).

      We can verify the formulas in the following short table of indefinite integrals
      simply by differentiating the functions indicated on the right side.

      [c-fendx =e: f fondx,

      These equations should be interpreted as meaning that a primitive of f + g can
      be obtained by adding a primitive of f to a primitive of g, while a primitive of
      c+ f can be obtained by multiplying a primitive of f by c.

      Notice the consequences of these formulas for definite integrals: If f and g are
      continuous, then

      These follow from the previous formulas, since each definite integral may be writ-
      ten as the difference of the values at a and b of a corresponding primitive. Con-
      tinuity is required in order to know that these primitives exist. (Of course, the
      formulas are also true when f and g are merely integrable, but recall how much
      more difficult the proofs are in this case.)

      The product formula for the derivative yields a more interesting theorem, which

      Since integration by parts depends upon recognizing that a function is of the  
      form g', the more functions you can already integrate, the greater your chances for  
      success. It is frequently reasonable to do a preliminary integration before tackling  
      the main problem. For example, we can use parts to integrate  

      [ cog)? ax = | (log x) (log x) dx  
      1 1  
      fg'  

      if we recall that flog x dx = x(logx) — x (this formula was itself derived by inte-  
      gration by parts); we have  

      | (log x) (log x) dx = (log x)[x (log x) — x] — | (1/x)[x(logx) — x] dx

      = (log x)[x(log x) — x] — [x(logx) — x] +x  
      = x(logx)* — 2x(log x) + 2x.  

      The most important method of integration is a consequence of the Chain Rule.  
      The use of this method requires considerably more ingenuity than integrating by  
      parts, and even the explanation of the method is more difficult. We will therefore

      we note that the integrand is of the form $\frac{1}{u} \cdot u'$, where $u = \log x$. Hence,

      $$

      It 1s quite uneconomical to obtain primitives from the substitution formula by first
      finding definite integrals. Instead, the two steps can be combined, to yield the

      du = g'(x)dx:

      (after this manipulation only the letter u should appear, not the
      letter x).

      (2) Find a primitive (as an expression involving u).

      These applications of the substitution formula* illustrate the most straight-
      forward and least interesting types—once the suitable factor g'(x) 1s recognized,
      the whole problem may even become simple enough to do mentally. The following
      three problems require only the information provided by the short table of indefi-
      nite integrals at the beginning of the chapter and, of course, the right substitution

      This formula cannot be taken literally (after all, $\int f(u)\,du$ should mean a primitive of $f$ and the symbol $\int f(g(x))g'(x)\,dx$ should mean a primitive of $(f \circ g) - 9'$; these are certainly not equal).
      However, it may be regarded as a symbolic summary of the procedure which we have developed. If
      we use Leibniz's notation, and a little fudging, the formula reads particularly well:

      $$
      \int f(u)\,du = \int f(v)\,dv,
      $$
      $$
      \frac{d}{dx} \int f(u)\,du = f(x),
      $$
      $$
      \frac{d}{dx} \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du = f(x).
      $$

      (the third problem has been disguised a little by some algebraic chicanery).

      $$
      \int \sec^2 x \tan^2 x \, dx,

      $$
      \int (\cos x)e^{x} \, dx,
      $$

      $$
      \int \frac{e^x}{\sqrt{1 - e^x}} \, dx.
      $$

      If you have not succeeded in finding the right substitutions, you should be able to
      guess them from the answers, which are $\frac{\tan^3 x}{6}$, $e^{x}$, and $\arcsin e^x$. At first you
      may find these problems too hard to do in your head, but at least when $g$ is of the
      very simple form $g(x) = ax +b$ you should not have to waste time writing out the
      substitution. The following integrations should all be clear. (The only worrisome
      detail is the proper positioning of the constant—should the answer to the second be

      $\frac{e^{3x}}{3}$ or $3e^{3x}$? I always take care of these problems as follows. Clearly $\int e^{3x} \, dx =
      e^{3x}$. (something). Now if I differentiate $F(x) = e^{3x}$, I get $F'(x) = 3e^{3x}$, so the
      "something" must be $x$ to cancel the 3.)

      $$
      \int \frac{1}{x + 3} \, dx = \ln |x + 3| + C,
      $$

      $$
      \int \frac{3x}{x} \, dx = 3x + C,
      $$

      $$
      \int \frac{\sin 4x}{4} \, dx = -\frac{1}{4} \cos 4x + C,
      $$

      $$
      \int \sin (ax + 1) \, dx = -\frac{1}{a} \cos (ax + 1) + C,
      $$

      $$
      \int \frac{1}{1 + 4x^2} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \arctan(2x) + C,
      $$

      $$
      \int \frac{1}{1 + 4x^2} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \arctan(2x) + C.
      $$

      More interesting uses of the substitution formula occur when the factor $g'(x)$
      does not appear. There are two main types of substitutions where this happens.

      Consider first

      $$
      \int \frac{1 + e^x}{1 - e^x} \, dx.
      $$

      The prominent appearance of the expression $e^x$ suggests the simplifying substitution

      Most substitution problems are much easier if one resorts to this trick of express-

      see why this trick always works (as long as the function expressing u in terms of x
      is one-one for all x under consideration): If we apply the substitution

      On the other hand, if we apply the straightforward substitution

      u = g(x)
      du = g'(x)dx
      to the same integral,
      l
      [ feonas = [ feo). — . g(x) dx,
      g'(x)

      we obtain

      |
      2 , du.
      ") [ Fo g'(g—!(u)) .

      The integrals (1) and (2) are identical, since (g-')'(u) = 1/g'(g7'(u)).
      As another concrete example, consider

      e2x
      | ax.
      ver + |
      - |-
      u = VJVet + 1,  
      ue = e + 1,  
      u > —1l = e*, x = log(u? — 1),  
      d Qu  
      x=  

      The integral then becomes

      (uz — 1)? 2u 5 QW  
      | 7 du = 2 fu? Adu = ~2u  

      Thus

      eet 2  
      dx = =(e* + 1)?/7 — 2(e +1)!".
      i ver +1 3  

      Another example, which illustrates the second main type of substitution that can  
      occur, is the integral  
      | V1 —x?dx.  

      In this case, instead of replacing a complicated expression by a simpler one, we  
      will replace x by sinu, because Vl —sin?u = cosu. This really means that we  
      are using the substitution u = arcsin x, but it is the expression for x in terms of u  
      which helps us find the expression to be substituted for dx. Thus,  

      let x = sinu, [u = arcsinx]  
      dx = cosudu;  

      then the integral becomes  

      [ vin sin cosudu = f cos? udu.  

      The evaluation of this integral depends on the equation  

      5 1+ cos2u  
      cos' u = 5  

      (see the discussion of trigonometric functions below) so that

      376 Derivatives and Integrals  

      Substitution and integration by parts are the only fundamental methods which  
      you have to learn; with their aid primitives can be found for a large number of  
      functions. Nevertheless, as some of our examples reveal, success often depends  
      upon some additional tricks. The most important are listed below. Using these  
      you should be able to integrate all the functions in Problems 1 to 10 (a few other  
      interesting tricks are explained in some of the remaining problems).

      the latter expression, multiplied out, involves terms of the form sin x cos' x, all of
      which can be integrated easily. The integral for cos" x is treated similarly. An
      integral

      | sin" x cos" x dx

      is handled the same way if n or m is odd. If n and m are both even, use the

      Although there are several ways of "deriving" this result, by means of the meth-
      ods already at our disposal (Problem 13), it 1s simplest to check this formula by
      differentiating the right side, and to memorize it.

      We might as well assume that a, = b, = 1. Moreover, we can assume that n < m,  
      for otherwise we may express p/q as a polynomial function plus a rational function  
      which zs of this form by dividing (the calculation  

      uz

      is a simple example). The integration of an arbitrary rational function depends  
      on two facts; the first follows from the "Fundamental Theorem of Algebra" (see  
      Chapter 26, Theorem 2 and Problem 26-3), but the second will not be proved in  
      this book.  

      THEOREM

      Every polynomial function

      (In this expression, identical factors have been collected together, so that all

      This expression, known as the "partial fraction decomposition" of p(x)/q(x), 1s
      so complicated that it is srmpler to examine the following example, which ulustrates
      such an expression and shows how to find it. According to the theorem, it 1s

      To find the numbers a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h, write the right side as a polynomial
      over the common denominator (x? + x + 1)*(x*2 + 2x + 3)(x — 1)*; the numerator
      becomes

      $$
      \frac{a(x - 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 + x + 1)^0 + b(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 + x + 1)^1 + (cx + d)(x - 1)^2(x^2 + x + 1)^1 + (ex + f)(x - 1)^1(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 + x + 1) + (gx + h)(x - 1)^2(x^2 + 2x + 2)}
      {(x^2 + x + 1)^2(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x - 1)^2}
      $$

      Actually multiplying this out (!) we obtain a polynomial of degree 8, whose coefficients are combinations of $ a,...,h $. Equating these coefficients with the coefficients of $ 2x^7 + 8x^6 + 13x^5 + 20x^4 + 4x^3 + 15x^2 + 16x + 7x + 10 $ (the coefficient of $ x^8 $ is 0)

      we obtain 8 equations in the eight unknowns $ a,...,h $. After heroic calculations these can be solved to give

      $$
      a = 2,\quad b = 1,\quad c = 1,\quad d = 3,
      $$
      $$
      e = 0,\quad f = 0,\quad g = 0,\quad h = 1.
      $$

      Thus,

      $$
      \frac{2x^7 + 5x^6 + 13x^5 + 20x^4 + 17x^3 + 16x^2 + 7x + 7}
      {(x^2 + x + 1)^2(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x - 1)^2}
      $$

      $$
      = \frac{a}{(x - 1)} + \frac{b}{(x - 1)^2} + \frac{c x + d}{(x^2 + x + 1)} + \frac{e x + f}{(x^2 + x + 1)^2} + \frac{g x + h}{(x^2 + 2x + 2)}
      $$

      $$
      = \frac{2}{(x - 1)} + \frac{1}{(x - 1)^2} + \frac{x + 3}{(x^2 + x + 1)} + \frac{0 x + 0}{(x^2 + x + 1)^2} + \frac{0 x + 1}{(x^2 + 2x + 2)}.
      $$

      $$
      = \frac{2}{(x - 1)} + \frac{1}{(x - 1)^2} + \frac{x + 3}{(x^2 + x + 1)} + \frac{1}{(x^2 + 2x + 2)}.
      $$

      (In simpler cases the requisite calculations may actually be feasible. I obtained this particular example by starting with the partial fraction decomposition and converting it into one fraction.)

      We are already in a position to find each of the integrals appearing in the above expression; the calculations will illustrate all the difficulties which arise in integrating rational functions.

      The first two integrals are simple:

      $$
      \int \frac{dx}{(x - 1)} = \log |x - 1|,
      $$
      $$
      \int \frac{dx}{(x - 1)^2} = \log |x - 1|.
      $$

      The third integration depends on "completing the square":

      $$
      \int \frac{x^2 + x + 1}{(x^2 + x + 1)^2} dx = \int \frac{1}{(x^2 + x + 1)} dx.

      (If we had obtained —3 instead of : we could not take the square root, but in this
      case our original quadratic factor could have been factored into linear factors.) We

      which can be computed using the third reduction formula given above.

      Finally, to evaluate
      | x+3
      (x? + 2x + v4
      we write

      | x+3 , ; | 2x +2 4 + | 2 7
      x=erz
      x*+2x+2 2) x74+2x4+2 * (x+1)2+1 .

      The first integral on the right side has been purposely constructed so that we can
      evaluate it by using the substitution

      u=x*+2x 42,
      du = (2x +2) dx

      The second integral on the right, which 1s just the difference of the other two, 1s
      simply 2 arctan(x + 1). If the original integral were

      | x+3 dx | 2x +2 4 +/ F
      == X X,
      (x2 + 2x +2)" 2) (x*+2x +2)" [(x + 1)% 4+ 1)"

      the first integral on the right would still be evaluated by the same substitution.
      The second integral would be evaluated by means of a reduction formula.

      This example has probably convinced you that integration of rational functions
      is a theoretical curiosity only, especially since it is necessary to find the factorization
      of g(x) before you can even begin. This is only partly true. We have already seen
      that simple rational functions sometimes arise, as in the integration

      Moreover, if a problem has been reduced to the integration of a rational function,  
      it is then certain that an elementary primitive exists, even when the difficulty or  
      impossibility of finding the factors of the denominator may preclude writing this  
      primitive explicitly.  

      PROBLEMS  

      1. This problem contains some integrals which require little more than alge-  
      braic manipulation, and consequently test your ability to discover algebraic  
      tricks, rather than your understanding of the integration processes. Never-  
      theless, any one of these tricks might be an important preliminary step in  
      an honest integration problem. Moreover, you want to have some feel for  
      which integrals are easy, so that you can see when the end of an integration  
      process is in sight. ‘The answer section, if you resort to it, will only reveal

      that

      no substitute for cleverness, but there is a general rule to follow: substitute
      for an expression which appears frequently or prominently; if two different
      troublesome expressions appear, try to express them both in terms of some
      new expression. And don't forget that it usually helps to express x directly
      in terms of u, to find out the proper expression to substitute for dx.

      The following two problems provide still more practice at integration, if you need it (and can bear it). Problem 9 involves algebraic and trigonometric manipulations and integration by parts, while Problem 10 involves substitutions.

      It looks very familiar. In general, the substitution x = cosh u often works for

      integrals involving √(x² - 1), while x = sinh u is the thing to try for integrals

      involving √(x² + 1). Try these substitutions on the other integrals in Problem

      4. (The method is not really recommended; it is easier to stick with

      trigonometric substitutions.)

      There are obvious substitutions to try,

      but integration by parts is much easier.

      Comparing the answers obtained is,

      perhaps, instructive.

      The world's sneakiest substitution is undoubtedly

      t = tan(1/2)x = 2 arctan t, dx =

      1 + t²

      *13.

      As we found in Problem 15-17, this substitution leads to the expressions

      | 2r 1 -1?
      sin x = 75 r e cosx = 5 r s
      This substitution thus transforms any integral which involves only sin and
      cos, combined by addition, multiplication, and division, into the integral of

      a rational function. Find

      (1) ∫ tan x dx (Compare your answer with Problem I(vi).)

      I — sin² x

      (111) ∫ 7 . (There is also another way to do this, using
      asinxX + OCOSX problem 15-8.)

      (iv) ∫ sin² x dx. (An exercise to convince you that this substitution
      should be used only as a last resort.)

      (v) ∫ a . (A last resort.)

      Derive the formula for ∫ sec x dx in the following two ways:

      (a) By writing

      ∫ cos x

      — =
      1 — sin² x

      i cos x 4 cos x
      2) 1 + sinx 1 - sinx |'

      an expression obviously inspired by partial fraction decompositions. Be
      sure to note that ∫ cosx/(1 - sinx) dx = -log(1 - sin x); the minus sign
      is very important. And remember that 5 log a = log (a). From there
      on, keep doing algebra, and trust to luck.
      - |-
      (b) By using the substitution $ \theta = \tan(x/2) $. One again, quite a bit of manipulation is required to put the answer in the desired form; the expression $ \tan(x/2) $ can be attacked by using Problem 15-9, or both answers can be expressed in terms of $ \theta $. There is another expression for $ \int \sec x \, dx $, which is less cumbersome than $ \log(\sec x + \tan x) $; using Problem 15-9, we obtain

      $$
      \int \sec x \, dx = \log \left| \frac{1 + \tan(x/2)}{1 - \tan(x/2)} \right| + C
      $$

      This last expression was actually the one first discovered, and was due, not to any mathematician's cleverness, but to a curious historical accident: In 1599 Wright computed nautical tables that amounted to definite integrals of sec. When the first tables for the logarithms of tangents were produced, the correspondence between the two tables was immediately noticed (but remained unexplained until the invention of calculus).

      The derivation of $ \int e^x \sin x \, dx $ given in the text seems to prove that the only primitive of $ f(x) = e^x \sin x $ is $ F(x) = \frac{e^x (\sin x - \cos x)}{2} $, whereas $ F(x) = \frac{e^x (\sin x - \cos x)}{2} + C $ is also a primitive for any number $ C $. Where does $ C $ come from? (What is the meaning of the equation

      $$
      \int e^x \sin x \, dx = \frac{e^x (\sin x - \cos x)}{2} - \int e^x \sin x \, dx?
      $$

      Suppose that $ f'' $ is continuous and that

      $$
      \int_0^\pi [f(x) + f''(x)] \sin x \, dx = 2.
      $$

      Given that $ f(\pi) = 1 $, compute $ f(0) $.

      *(b) Generalize this trick: Find $ \int f^{-1}(x) \, dx $ in terms of $ \int f(x) \, dx $. Compare with Problems 12-21 and 14-14.

      and then using the formula for sin' x.  
      (b) Combine your answers to obtain an impressive trigonometric identity.

      Express ∫ log(log x) dx in terms of ∫ logx dx. (Neither is expressible in  
      terms of elementary functions.)

      (Do not try to find it!)

      Prove the reduction formulas in the text. For the third one write  
      ∫ dx - ∫ dx - ∫ x^2 dx  
      (x^2 + 1)^n - (x^2 + 1)^{n-1} (x^2 + 1)^n  

      and work on the last integral. (Another possibility is to use the substitution  
      x = tan u.)

      Let $ c $ be a curve represented parametrically by $ u $ and $ v $ on $[a, b]$, and let $ h $ be an increasing function with $ h(a) = a $ and $ h(b) = b $.

      (b) Recall that the cycloid is the graph of $ v = 7! $. Find the area under one arch of the cycloid by using the appropriate substitution in $ \int $ and evaluating the resultant integral. [Answer: $ 3\pi a^2 $.]

      Use induction and integration by parts to generalize Problem 14-10:

      If $ f' $ is continuous on $ [a, b] $, use integration by parts to prove the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma for $ f $:

      $$
      \lim_{A \to \infty} \int_a^b f(t) \sin(At) dt = 0.
      $$

      This result is just a special case of Problem 15-26, but it can be used to prove the general case (in much the same way that the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma was derived in Problem 15-26 from the special case in which $ f $ is a step function).

      The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals was introduced in Problem 13-23. The "Second Mean Value Theorem for Integrals" states the following. Suppose that $ f $ is integrable on $ [a,b] $ and that $ g $ is either nondecreasing or nonincreasing on $ [a, b] $. Then there is a number $ c $ in $ [a, b] $ such that

      $$
      \int_a^b f(x)g(x) dx = f(a) \int_a^b g(x) dx + f(b) \int_a^b g(x) dx.
      $$

      In this problem, we will assume that $ f $ is continuous and that $ g $ is differentiable, with a continuous derivative $ g' $.

      (a) Prove that if the result is true for nonincreasing $ g $, then it is also true for nondecreasing $ g $.

      (b) Prove that if the result is true for nonincreasing $ g $ satisfying $ g(b) = 0 $, then it is true for all nonincreasing $ g $.

      Thus, we can assume that $ g $ is nonincreasing and $ g(b) = 0 $. In this case, we have to prove that

      $$
      \int_a^b f(x)g(x) dx = g(a) \int_a^b f(x) dx.
      $$

      (c) Prove this by using integration by parts.

      (d) Show that the hypothesis that $ g $ is either nondecreasing or nonincreasing is needed.
      - |-
      From this special case of the Second Mean Value Theorem for Integrals, the
      general case could be derived by some approximation arguments, Just as in the case
      of the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma. But there is a more instructive way, outlined

      in the next problem.

      36.

      (a) Given $ q_1, \ldots, q_n $ and $ b_1, \ldots, b_n $, let $ S_k = a_1 + \cdots + a_k $. Show that

      $$
      (q_1b_1 + \cdots + q_n b_n) = S_1(b_1 - b_2) + S_2(b_2 - b_3)
      + \cdots + S_{n-1}(b_{n-1} - b_n) + S_n b_n,
      $$

      This disarmingly simple formula is sometimes called "Abel's formula for summation
      by parts." It may be regarded as an analogue for sums of the integration by parts formula

      $$
      \int_a^b f'(x)g(x) dx = f(b)g(b) - f(a)g(a) - \int_a^b f(x)g'(x) dx,
      $$

      especially if we use Riemann sums (Chapter 13, Appendix). In fact, for a partition

      $ P = \{ t_0, \ldots, t_n \} $ of $[a, b]$, the left side is approximately

      $$
      \sum_{k=1}^n f(t_k) \Delta t_k,
      $$

      while the right side is approximately

      $$
      f(b)g(b) - f(a)g(a) - \sum_{k=1}^n f(t_k) \Delta t_k,
      $$

      which is approximately

      $$
      f(b)g(b) - f(a)g(a) + \sum_{k=1}^n f(t_k) [g(t_k) - g(t_{k-1})].
      $$

      This simplifies to

      $$
      f(b)g(b) - f(a)g(a) + \sum_{k=1}^n [F(t_k) - F(t_{k-1})] [g(t_k) - g(t_{k-1})],
      $$

      where $ F $ is an antiderivative of $ f $. This can be further simplified to:

      $$
      f(b)g(b) - f(a)g(a) + \sum_{k=1}^n [F(t_k) - F(t_{k-1})] [g(t_k) - g(t_{k-1})].
      $$

      Since the right-most sum is just $ g(a) - g(b) $, this works out to be

      $$
      f(b)g(b) - f(a)g(a) + g(a) - g(b).

      The first symbol on the right side means, of course,

      The gamma function thus provides a simple example of a continuous function  
      which "interpolates" the values of n! for natural numbers n. Of course there  
      are infinitely many continuous functions f with f(n) = (n — 1)!; there are  
      even infinitely many continuous functions f with f(x + 1) = xf (x) for all  
      x > 0. However, the gamma function has the important additional property  
      that log o F 1s convex, a condition which expresses the extreme smoothness  
      of this function. A beautiful theorem due to Harold Bohr and Johannes  
      Mollerup states that T' is the only function f with logof convex, f(1) = |  
      and f(x + 1) = xf(x). See reference [43] of the Suggested Reading.

      $$
      \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^n x \, dx = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^{n-2} x \, dx

      (b) Now show that  

      $$
      \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^n x \, dx = \frac{n-1}{n} \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^{n-2} x \, dx
      $$

      and conclude that  

      $$
      \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^n x \, dx = \frac{n-1}{n} \cdot \frac{n-3}{n-2} \cdots \frac{1}{2} \cdot \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin^2 x \, dx
      $$

      Show that the quotient of the two integrals in this expression is between  
      1 and 1 + 1/2n, starting with the inequalities  

      $$
      \frac{2n-1}{2n} \cdot x < \sin x < x \quad \text{for } 0 < x < \frac{\pi}{2}

      Wallis' procedure was quite different! He worked with the integral fa — x?" dx

      If we interpret x! to mean F(1 + 4), this agrees with Problem 45, but Wallis did not
      know of the gamma function (which was invented by Euler, guided principally by Wallis'

      2
      work). Since (2n)!/(n!)* is the binomial coefficient ( "), Wallis hoped to find 5! by
      n

      finding (' 4) for p=q = 1/2. Now
      P

      In Chapter 13 we said, rather blithely, that integrals may be computed to any
      degree of accuracy desired by calculating lower and upper sums. But an applied
      mathematician, who really has to do the calculation, rather than just talking about
      doing it, may not be overjoyed at the prospect of computing lower sums to evaluate
      an integral to three decimal places, say (a degree of accuracy that might easily be
      needed in certain circumstances). The next three problems show how more refined
      methods can make the calculations much more efficient.

      We ought to mention at the outset that computing upper and lower sums might
      not even be practical, since it might not be possible to compute the quantities m;

      and M; for each interval [f;_1, ¢;]. It is far more reasonable simply to pick points x;
      n

      in [t;_1, ¢;] and consider a f (xi) - (t; — t;-1). This represents the sum of the areas

      i=l

      of certain rectangles which partially overlap the graph of f—see Figure | in the
      Appendix to Chapter 13. But we will get a much better result if we instead choose
      the trapezoids shown in Figure 2.

      Approximations to $ | f $. In the next problem we will estimate $ | f - \overline{X}_y $.

      47. (a) Suppose that $ f'' $ is continuous. Let $ P_i $ be the linear function which agrees with $ f $ at $ x_{i-1} $ and $ x_i $. Using Problem 11-46, show that if $ m_i $ and $ M_i $ are the minimum and maximum of $ f'' $ on $ [x_{i-1}, x_i] $, and

      $$
      b = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i x_i
      $$

      then

      $$
      2 \Delta x_i f(x_i) - 2 \Delta x_i f(x_{i-1}) = 2 \Delta x_i (f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1}))
      $$

      (b) Evaluate $ J $ to get

      $$
      3 \Delta x_i f(x_i) - 3 \Delta x_i f(x_{i-1}) = 3 \Delta x_i (f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1}))
      $$

      (c) Conclude that there is some $ c $ in $ (a, b) $ with

      $$
      \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_{i-1})
      $$

      Notice that the "error term" $ \frac{(b - a)^2}{12n^2} f''(c) $ varies as $ \frac{1}{n^2} $ (while the error obtained using ordinary sums varies as $ \frac{1}{n} $).

      $$
      \frac{a + b}{2}
      $$

      We can obtain still more accurate results if we approximate $ f $ by quadratic functions rather than by linear functions. We first consider what happens when the interval $ [a, b] $ is divided into two equal intervals (Figure 3).

      48. (a) Suppose first that $ a = 0 $ and $ b = 2 $. Let $ P $ be the polynomial function of degree $ < 2 $ which agrees with $ f $ at 0, 1, and 2 (Problem 3-6). Show that

      $$
      P = \frac{1}{2} f(0) + 4 f(1) + \frac{1}{2} f(2)
      $$

      (b) Conclude that in the general case

      $$
      \frac{b - a}{2} f(a) + 4 f\left( \frac{a + b}{2} \right) - \frac{b - a}{2} f(b)
      $$

      (c) Naturally $ \int P = f $ when $ f $ is a quadratic polynomial. But, remarkably enough, this same relation holds when $ f $ is a cubic polynomial!

      Prove this, using Problem 11-46; note that $ f'' $ is a constant.

      The previous problem shows that we do not have to do any new calculations to compute $ \int Q $ when $ Q $ is a cubic polynomial which agrees with $ f $ at $ a, b, $ and $ \frac{a + b}{2} $. We still have

      $$
      \int Q = \frac{b - a}{2} f(a) + 4 f\left( \frac{a + b}{2} \right) - \frac{b - a}{2} f(b)
      $$
      - |-
      But there is much more leeway in choosing Q, which we can use to our advantage:

      49. (a) Show that there is a cubic polynomial function Q satisfying

      $$
      O(a)= f(a), \quad O(b)=f(b), \quad O\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)=H(S)
      $$

      Hint: Clearly $ Q(x) = P(x) + A(x - a)(x - b)\left(x - \frac{a+b}{2}\right) $ for some $ A $.

      (b) Prove that if $ f^{(4)} $ is defined on $[a, b]$, then for every $ x $ in $[a,b]$ we have

      $$
      f(x) - Q(x) = f^{(4)}(\xi)(x - a)^4
      $$

      for some $ \xi $ in $(a,b)$. Hint: Imitate the proof of Problem 11-46.

      (c) Conclude that if $ f $ is continuous, then

      $$
      \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \frac{b - a}{24} \left[ f(a) + 4f\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right) + f(b) \right]
      $$

      for some $ c $ in $(a,b)$.

      (d) Now divide $[a, b]$ into $ 2n $ intervals by means of the points

      $$
      x_i = a + \frac{i(b - a)}{2n}, \quad i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 2n
      $$

      Prove Simpson's rule:

      $$
      \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \frac{b - a}{24n} \left[ f(a) + 4\sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_{2i-1}) + 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f(x_{2i}) + 4f(b) \right]
      $$

      for some $ c $ in $(a, b)$.

      APPENDIX. THE COSMOPOLITAN INTEGRAL
      - |-
      We originally introduced integrals in order to find the area under the graph of  
      a function, but the integral is considerably more versatile than that. For example,  
      Problem 13-24 used the integral to express the area of a region of quite another  
      sort. Moreover, Problem 13-25 showed that the integral can also be used to ex-  
      press the lengths of curves—though, as we've seen in Appendix to Chapter 13, a  
      lot of work may be necessary to consider the general case! This result was prob-  
      ably a little more surprising, since the integral seems, at first blush, to be a very  
      two-dimensional creature. Actually, the integral makes its appearance in quite a  
      few geometric formulas, which we will present in this Appendix. ‘To derive these  
      C formulas we will assume some results from elementary geometry (and allow a little  

      fudging).

      Instead of going down to one-dimensional objects, we'll begin by tackling some  
      three-dimensional ones. There are some very special solids whose volumes can  
      be expressed by integrals. The simplest such solid V is a "solid of revolution,"  
      obtained by revolving the region under the graph of f > 0 on [a,b] around  
      FIGURE 1 the horizontal axis, when we regard the plane as situated in space (Figure 1).  
      If P = {t,...,t,} 1s any partition of [a,b], and m; and M; have their usual  
      meanings, then  

      2  
      f wm; (t; — ti-1)  

      \ \ is the volume of a disc that lies inside the solid V (Figure 2). Similarly,  
      na M;*(t; — t;-;) is the volume of a disc that contains the part of V between ¢j_|  
      and ¢t;. Consequently,  

      1s So mi (ti —t;-,) < volume V <x So Mi? (i —t;_}).

      FIGURE 2 i=l i=]

      But the sums on the ends of this inequality are just the lower and upper sums for  
      f? on [a, bl:  

      x L(f*, P) < volume V<2-U(f', P).  

      Consequently, the volume of V must be given by  

      b

      The surface area of certain curved regions can also be expressed in terms of integrals. Before we tackle complicated regions, a little review of elementary geometric formulas may be appreciated here.

      Figure 7 shows a right pyramid made up of triangles with bases of length $ l $ and altitude $ s $. The total surface area of the sides of the pyramid is thus

      $$
      2P s
      $$

      where $ P $ is the perimeter of the base. By choosing the base to be a regular polygon with a large number of sides we see that the area of a right circular cone (Figure 8) must be

      $$
      \frac{1}{2}(2\pi s) = \pi s,
      $$

      where $ s $ is the "slant height." Finally, consider the frustum of a cone with slant height $ s $ and radii $ r_1 $ and $ r_2 $ shown in Figure 9(a). Completing this to a cone, as in Figure 9(b), we have

      $$
      S = \frac{1}{2} r_1 s + \frac{1}{2} r_2 s
      $$

      so that

      $$
      S = \frac{1}{2} s (r_1 + r_2)
      $$

      Consequently, the surface area is

      $$
      \pi (r_1^2 - r_2^2) = \pi s (r_1 + r_2)
      $$

      Now consider the surface formed by revolving the graph of $ f $ around the horizontal axis. For a partition $ P = \{ t_0, t_1, ..., t_n \} $ we can inscribe a series of frustums of cones, as in Figure 10. The total surface area of these frustums is

      $$
      \sum_{i=1}^{n} 2 \pi \left( \frac{f(t_i) + f(t_{i-1})}{2} \right) \sqrt{(t_i - t_{i-1})^2 + [f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1})]^2}
      $$

      $$
      = 2 \pi \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1}) \right) \sqrt{(t_i - t_{i-1})^2 + [f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1})]^2}
      $$

      $$
      = 2 \pi \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1}) \right) \sqrt{(t_i - t_{i-1})^2 + [f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1})]^2}
      $$

      By the Mean Value Theorem, this is

      $$
      2 \pi \sum_{i=1}^{n} f'(x_i) (t_i - t_{i-1}) \sqrt{(t_i - t_{i-1})^2 + [f(t_i) - f(t_{i-1})]^2}
      $$

      for some $ x_i $ in $ (t_{i-1}, t_i) $. Appealing to Problem 1 of the Appendix to Chapter 13,
      - |-
      We conclude that the surface area is

      () APPROXIMATION BY
      CHAPTER POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS

      There is one sense in which the "elementary functions" are not elementary at all.
      If p is a polynomial function,

      P(x) = ag tax +--+ +aynx",

      then p(x) can be computed easily for any number x. This is not at all true for
      functions like sin, log, or exp. At present, to find log x = {; 1/t dt approximately,
      we must compute some upper or lower sums, and make certain that the error
      involved in accepting such a sum for logx is not too great. Computing e* =
      log~'(x) would be even more difficult: we would have to compute log a for many
      values of a until we found a number a such that log a is approximately x—then a
      would be approximately e".
      - |-
      In this chapter we will obtain important theoretical results which reduce the
      computation of f(x), for many functions f, to the evaluation of polynomial func-
      tions. 'The method depends on finding polynomial functions which are close ap-
      proximations to f. In order to guess a polynomial which is appropriate, it 1s useful
      to first examine polynomial functions themselves more thoroughly.

      Suppose that

      p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + ... + a_nx^n.

      It is interesting, and for our purposes very important, to note that the coefficients a_i
      can be expressed in terms of the value of p and its various derivatives at 0. 'To
      begin with, note that

      p(0) = a_0.

      Differentiating the original expression for p(x) yields

      p'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2x + ... + n a_n x^{n-1}.

      Therefore,
      p'(0) = a_1.

      Differentiating again we obtain
      p''(x) = 2a_2 + 3a_3x + ... + n(n-1)a_n x^{n-2}.

      Therefore,
      p''(0) = 2a_2.

      In general, we will have

      p^{(k)}(0) = k! a_k or a_k = \frac{p^{(k)}(0)}{k!}.

      If we agree to define 0! = 1, and recall the notation p^{(k)} = p^{(k)}, then this formula
      holds for k = 0 also.

      [41]

      p^{(k)}(0) = k! a_k or a_k = \frac{p^{(k)}(0)}{k!}.

      If we had begun with a function p that was written as a "polynomial in (x —a),"
      p(x) = a_0 + a_1(x — a) + ... + a_n(x — a)^n,
      then a similar argument would show that

      p(a) = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k (x - a)^k,

      and

      a_k = \frac{p^{(k)}(a)}{k!}.

      Suppose now that f is a function (not necessarily a polynomial) such that

      f(a), f'(a), f''(a), ..., f^{(n-1)}(a)
      all exist. Let
      f^{(k)}(a), 0 < k < n,

      and define
      P_n(x) = a_0 + a_1(x - a) + ... + a_n (x - a)^n.

      The polynomial P,,. 1s called the Taylor polynomial of degree n for f at a.
      (Strictly speaking, we should use an even more complicated expression, like Pru, s,
      to indicate the dependence on f; at times this more precise notation will be useful.)
      The ‘Taylor polynomial has been defined so that

      Pra (a) = f(a) for 0 < k < n;

      in fact, it is clearly the only polynomial of degree < n with this property.

      Although the coefficients of P,.a,f seem to depend upon f in a fairly complhi-
      cated way, the most important elementary functions have extremely simple Taylor
      polynomials. Consider first the function sin. We have

      sin(Q) = Q,
      sin'(0) = cosO = 1,
      sin' (0) = —sin0 = 0,
      sin' (0) = —cosO = —1,
      sin (0) = sin0O = 0.

      One simple consequence of Theorem | allows us to perfect the test for local
      maxima and minima which was developed in Chapter 11. If a is a critical point
      of f, then, according to Theorem 11-5, the function f has a local minimum
      at aif f"(a) > O, and a local maximum ata if f"(a) < 0. If f"(a) = 0 no
      conclusion was possible, but it is conceivable that the sign of f(a) might give
      further information; and if f'"(a) = 0, then the sign of f(a) = 0 might be
      significant. Even more generally, we can ask what happens when

      (*)  f(a)=f'(a)=---=f^{(n)}(a) =0
      f(a) ≠ 0.
      The situation in this case can be guessed by examining the functions
      f(x) — (x _ a)^n,

      g(x) = —(x - a)^n,

      which satisfy (*). Notice (Figure 2) that if n is odd, then a is neither a local
      maximum nor a local minimum point for f or g. On the other hand, if n is
      even, then f, with a positive nth derivative, has a local minimum at a, while
      g, with a negative nth derivative, has a local maximum at a. Of all functions
      satisfying (*), these are about the simplest available; nevertheless they indicate the
      general situation exactly. In fact, the whole point of the next proof is that any
      function satisfying (*) looks very much like one of these functions, in a sense that
      is made precise by Theorem 1.

      (1) If n is even and f(a) > 0, then f has a local minimum at a.
      (2) If n is even and f(a) < 0, then f has a local maximum at a.
      (3) If n is odd, then f has neither a local maximum nor a local minimum at a.

      There is clearly no loss of generality in assuming that f(a) = 0, since neither the
      hypotheses nor the conclusion are affected if f is replaced by f — f(a). Then,
      since the first n — 1 derivatives of f at a are O, the ‘Taylor polynomial P_n of f is

      f(a) + f'(a)(x — a) + f''(a)(x — a)^2 / 2! + ... + f^{(n)}(a)(x — a)^n / n!

      But since f(a) = 0, the Taylor polynomial P_n of f is

      P_n(x) = f^{(n)}(a)(x — a)^n / n!

      Thus, Theorem 1 states that

      f(x) — P_n(x) = f(x) — f^{(n)}(a)(x — a)^n / n!

      Therefore, Theorem 1 states that

      f(x) — P_n(x) = f(x) — f^{(n)}(a)(x — a)^n / n!

      Thus, Theorem 1 states that

      f(x) — P_n(x) = f(x) — f^{(n)}(a)(x — a)^n / n!

      Consequently, if x is sufficiently close to a, then

      f(x) — f(a)

      has the same sign as

      (x — a)^n / n!

      Suppose now that n is even. In this case (x — a)^n > 0 for all x ≠ a. Since
      f(x)/(x — a)^n has the same sign as f^{(n)}(a)/n! for x sufficiently close to a, it follows
      that f(x) itself has the same sign as f^{(n)}(a)/n! for x sufficiently close to a. If
      f^{(n)}(a) > 0, this means that

      f(x) > 0 = f(a)

      for x close to a. Consequently, f has a local minimum at a. A similar proof works
      for the case f^{(n)}(a) < 0.

      Now suppose that n is odd. The same argument as before shows that if x is
      sufficiently close to a, then

      f(x)
      (x — a)^n 
      has the same sign as f^{(n)}(a)/n! for x sufficiently close to a. Since n is odd, (x — a)^n
      changes sign as x crosses a. Therefore, f(x) changes sign as x crosses a, which means
      that f has neither a local maximum nor a local minimum at a.
      - |-
      But (x —a)" > O for x > a and (x —a)" < O for x <a. Therefore f(x) has different
      signs for x > a and x <a. This proves that f has neither a local maximum nor
      a local minimum at a. J

      always has the same sign.

      Although Theorem 2 will settle the question of local maxima and minima for
      just about any function which arises in practice, it does have some theoretical
      limitations, because f\)(a) may be 0 for all k. This happens (Figure 3(a)) for the
      function
      etx y # 0)

      0, x =Q,

      which has a minimum at O, and also for the negative of this function (Figure 3(b)),
      which has a maximum at 0. Moreover (Figure 3(c)), if

      f(x) =

      ent /x? x>0O

      f(x)= 4 0, x =0
      2

      —et/ y <0,

      then f")(O) = 0 for all k, but f has neither a local minimum nor a local maximum
      at Q.

      The conclusion of Theorem | is often expressed in terms of an important con-
      cept of "order of equality." ‘Iwo functions f and g are equal up to order n

      In the language of this definition, Theorem 1 says that the ‘Taylor polynomial
      P,.a.f equals f up to order n at a. The ‘Taylor polynomial might very well have
      been designed to make this fact true, because there is at most one polynomial of
      degree < n with this property. This assertion is a consequence of the following
      elementary theorem.

      Let P and Q be two polynomials in (x — a), of degree < n, and suppose that P
      and Q are equal up to ordern ata. Then P = Q.

      Let R = P —@Q. Since R 1s a polynomial of degree < n, it 1s only necessary to

      then R = 0. Now the hypothesis on R surely imply that

      $$
      \lim_{x \to a} \frac{R(x)}{(x - a)^n} = 0 \quad \text{for } 0 < i < n.
      $$

      For $ i = 0 $ this condition reads simply $\lim_{x \to a} R(x) = 0$; on the other hand,

      $$
      \lim_{x \to a} R(x) = \lim_{x \to a} [b_0 + b_1 (x - a) + \cdots + b_n (x - a)^n]
      = b_0.
      $$

      Thus $ b_0 = 0 $ and
      $$
      R(x) = b_1 (x - a) + \cdots + b_n (x - a)^n.
      $$

      Therefore,
      $$
      \frac{R(x)}{(x - a)^i} = \frac{b_0 + b_1 (x - a) + \cdots + b_n (x - a)^n}{(x - a)^i}
      $$
      and
      $$
      \lim_{x \to a} \frac{R(x)}{(x - a)^i} = b_i.
      $$

      Thus $ b_0 = 0 $ and
      $$
      R(x) = b_1 (x - a)^1 + \cdots + b_n (x - a)^n.
      $$

      Continuing in this way, we find that

      Let $ f $ be $ n $-times differentiable at $ a $, and suppose that $ P $ is a polynomial in $ (x - a) $ of degree $ < n $, which equals $ f $ up to order $ n $ at $ a $. Then $ P = P_{a,f} $.

      Since $ P $ and $ P_{a,f} $ both equal $ f $ up to order $ n $ at $ a $, it is easy to see that $ P $ equals $ P_{a,f} $ up to order $ n $ at $ a $. Consequently, $ P = P_{a,f} $ by the Theorem. J

      At first sight this corollary appears to have unnecessarily complicated hypotheses;
      it might seem that the existence of the polynomial $ P $ would automatically imply
      that $ f $ is sufficiently differentiable for $ P_{a,f} $ to exist. But in fact this is not so. For
      example (Figure 4), suppose that

      $$
      f(x) = 
      \begin{cases}
      x^n & \text{if } x \text{ is irrational} \\
      0 & \text{if } x \text{ is rational}
      \end{cases}
      $$

      FIGURE 4
      - |-
      When f does have n derivatives at a, however, the corollary may provide a
      useful method for finding the ‘Taylor polynomial of f. In particular, remember
      that our first attempt to find the ‘Taylor polynomial for arctan ended in failure.

      The equation x
      arctan x = ∫ dt
      0 1 + t²

      suggests a promising method of finding a polynomial close to arctan—divide 1
      by 1 + t², to obtain a polynomial plus a remainder:

      1

      This formula, which can be checked easily by multiplying both sides by 1 + t²,
      shows that

      When $|x| < 1$, this expression is at most $1/(2n + 3)$, and we can make this as
      small as we like simply by choosing $n$ large enough. In other words, for $|x| < 1$
      we can use the Taylor polynomials for $\arctan$ to compute $\arctan x$ as accurately as we like.
      The most important theorems about Taylor polynomials extend this isolated result
      to other functions, and the Taylor polynomials will soon play quite a new role.
      The theorems proved so far have always examined the behavior of the Taylor
      polynomial $P_{n,a}(x)$ for fixed $n$, as $x$ approaches $a$. Henceforth we will compare ‘Taylor
      polynomials $P_{n,a}(x)$ for fixed $x$, and different $n$. In anticipation of the coming theorem
      we introduce some new notation.

      If $f$ is a function for which $P_{q}(x)$ exists, we define the remainder term

      We would like to have an expression for R,,4(x) whose size is easy to estimate.
      There is such an expression, involving an integral, just as in the case for arctan.
      One way to guess this expression is to begin with the case n = 0:

      f(x) = fla) + Roa(x).

      The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus enables us to write

      A similar expression for Rj,(x) can be derived from this formula using integra-
      tion by parts in a rather tricky way: Let

      (notice that x represents some fixed number in the expression for u(t), so u'(t) = 1);

      then x x

      discover after sufficiently many similar but futile manipulations. However, it 1s

      and this requires only a brief glance at a table of factorials. (Moreover, the indi-

      with n = 3). These methods can actually be used to compute tables of sin and  
      cos; a high-speed computer can compute P2,41.9(x) for many different x in almost  
      no time at all. Nowadays, computers, and even cheap calculators, determine the  
      values of such functions "on-the-fly", though by specialized methods that are even  
      faster.

      With this estimate it is easy to find an n which will make the remainder less than  
      any preassigned number; on the other hand, n will usually have to be so large as to  
      make computations hopelessly long. To obtain a remainder < 10~*, for example, we must take n > (10* — 3)/2. This is really a shame, because arctan 1 = 7/4,  
      so the Taylor polynomial for arctan should allow us to compute z. Fortunately,  
      there are some clever tricks which enable us to surmount these difficulties. Since

      which is impossible for an integer. J

      The second illustration is merely a straightforward demonstration of a fact

      proved in Chapter 15: If

      f''(x) = -f(x),
      f(0) = 9,
      f'(0) = 0,
      then f = 0. To prove this, observe first that f'' exists for every k; in fact
      f(k) = (-1)^k f(x),
      f(0) = (f(0))' = (-f') = -f'' = f
      f'(0) = (f(0))' = f

      etc.
      430 Infinite Sequences and Infinite Series

      This shows, not only that all f'' exist, but also that there are at most 4 different
      ones: f, f', -f, -f'. Since f(0) = f'(0) = 0, all f(0) are 0. Now Taylor's

      Theorem states, for any n, that

      f(x) = Σ f^(k)(0)/k! (x - 0)^k + R_n(x)

      for some t in [0, x]. Each function f^(k) exists (since f^(n) exists)), so for
      any particular x there is a number M such that

      |f^(k)(t)| < M for 0 < t < x, and all n

      (we can add the phrase "and all n" because there are only four different f^(k)?).

      Thus

      |f(x)| < M |x|^n / (n+1)! .
      Since this is true for every n, and since |x|^n /n! can be made as small as desired by
      choosing n sufficiently large, this shows that | f(x)| < ε for any ε > 0; consequently,

      f(x) = 0.

      The other uses to which Taylor's Theorem will be put in succeeding chapters
      are closely related to the computational considerations which have concerned us
      for much of this chapter. If the remainder term R_n(x) can be made as small as
      desired by choosing n sufficiently large, then f(x) can be computed to any degree
      of accuracy desired by using the polynomials P_n(x). As we require greater and
      greater accuracy we must add on more and more terms. If we are willing to add
      up infinitely many terms (in theory at least!), then we ought to be able to ignore
      the remainder completely. There should be "infinite sums" like

      This problem is similar to the previous one, except that the errors demanded
      are so small that the tables cannot be used. You will have to do a little
      thinking, and in some cases it may be necessary to consult the proof, in
      Chapter 16, that x"/n! can be made small by choosing n large—the proof
      actually provides a method for finding the appropriate n. In the previous
      problem it was possible to find rather short sums; in fact, it was possible
      to find the smallest n which makes the estimate of the remainder given by
      Taylor's Theorem less than the desired error. But in this problem, finding any
      specific sum is a moral victory (provided you can demonstrate that the sum

      works).

      \text{Pria. } f + e = \text{Fria. } f + \text{Pria. } g - :

      **(b)** Similarly, Problem 7 (11) could be used to show that  
      $$
      \text{Pria. } f \cdot g = [\text{Pria. } f \circ \text{Pria. } g]_{n},
      $$  
      where $ [P]_n $ denotes the truncation of $ P $ to degree $ n $, the sum of all  
      terms of $ P $ of degree $ < n $ [with $ P $ written as a polynomial in $ x - a $].  
      Again, give a more direct proof, using obvious facts about products involving terms of the form $ R_{\text{nia}} $.

      **(c)** Prove that if $ p $ and $ q $ are polynomials in $ x - a $ and  
      $$
      \lim_{x \to a} \frac{R(x)}{(x - a)^n} = 0,

      then  
      $$
      p(q(x) + R(x)) = p(q(x)) + R(x),

      where  
      $$
      \lim_{x \to a} \frac{R(x)}{(x - a)^n} = 0.
      $$  
      Also note that if $ p $ is a polynomial in $ x - a $ having only terms of degree  
      $ > n $, and $ q $ is a polynomial in $ x - a $ whose constant term is 0, then all  
      terms of $ p(q(x)) $ are of degree $ > n $.

      Problem 18-43 presented a rather complicated proof that f = O if f"—f = 0 and f(O) = f'(O) = 0. Give another proof, using Taylor's Theorem. (This problem is really a preliminary skirmish before doing battle with the general case in Problem 26, and is meant to convince you that Taylor's Theorem is a good tool for tackling such problems, even though tricks work out more neatly for special cases.)

      Consider a function f which satisfies the differential equation

      $$
      f^{(n)}(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j f^{(j)}(x)
      $$

      for certain numbers $ a_0, \ldots, a_{n-1} $. Several special cases have already received detailed treatment, either in the text or in other problems; in particular, we have found all functions satisfying $ f' = f $, or $ f'' + f = 0 $, or $ f''' - f = 0 $. The trick in Problem 18-42 enables us to find many solutions for such equations, but doesn't say whether these are the only solutions. This requires a uniqueness result, which will be supplied by this problem. At the end you will find some (necessarily sketchy) remarks about the general solution.

      (a) Derive the following formula for $ f^{(n)} (x) $ (let us agree that "a_{-1}" will be 0):

      $$
      f^{(n)} (x) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} (a_j f^{(j)}(x) + a_{j+1} f^{(j+1)}(x))
      $$

      (b) Deduce a formula for $ f^{(n)} (x) $.

      The formula in part (b) is not going to be used; it was inserted only to convince you that a general formula for $ f^{(n)} (x) $ is out of the question. On the other hand, as part (c) shows, it is not very hard to obtain estimates on the size of $ f^{(n)} (x) $.

      (c) Let $ N = \max(\lvert a_0 \rvert, \ldots, \lvert a_{n-1} \rvert) $. Then $ \lvert a_j + a_{j+1} \rvert < 2N $. This means that

      $$
      f^{(n)} (x) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} b_j f^{(j)} (x),
      $$

      where $ \lvert b_j \rvert < 2N $.

      Show that

      $$
      \lvert f^{(n)} (x) \rvert \leq \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} 4N^3.

      with g(a) = g(b) = f(a). For sufficiently small ε > 0 we will have
      g(x) > g(a), so g will have a maximum point y in (a,b). Now use
      Problem 23(c) (the Schwarz second derivative of (x - a)(b - x) is simply
      its ordinary second derivative).

      If f is a continuous function on [a, b] whose Schwarz second derivative
      is 0 at all points of (a,b), then f is linear.

      This example is slightly more complex, but also slightly more impressive,

      a ≠ 0. Thus, for each number a there is another number m(a) such that

      € IS TRANSCENDENTAL

      The irrationality of e was so easy to prove that in this optional chapter we will
      attempt a more difficult feat, and prove that the number e is not merely irrational,
      but actually much worse. Just how a number might be even worse than irrational
      is suggested by a slight rewording of definitions. A number x is irrational if it is
      not possible to write x = a/b for any integers a and b, with b ≠ 0. This is the
      same as saying that x does not satisfy any equation

      bx —a = 0

      for integers a and b, except for a = 0, b = 0. Viewed in this light, the irrationality
      of √2 does not seem to be such a terrible deficiency; rather, it appears that √2 just

      a x + a g = 0,
      it is the solution of the equation
      x² - 2 = 0,

      of one higher degree. Problem 2-18 shows how to produce many irrational numbers x which satisfy higher-degree equations

      Anxⁿ + yxⁿ⁻¹ + ... + aₙ = 0,

      where the a; are integers not all 0. A number which satisfies an "algebraic" equation of this sort is called an algebraic number, and practically every number we
      have ever encountered is defined in terms of solutions of algebraic equations (7
      and e are the great exceptions in our limited mathematical experience). All roots,

      such as

      are clearly algebraic numbers, and even complicated combinations, like

      34541434 %

      are algebraic (although we will not try to prove this). Numbers which cannot be
      obtained by the process of solving algebraic equations are called transcendental;
      the main result of this chapter states that e is a number of this anomalous sort.
      The proof that e is transcendental is well within our grasp, and was theoretically
      possible even before Chapter 20. Nevertheless, with the inclusion of this proof, we
      can justifiably classify ourselves as something more than novices in the study of
      higher mathematics; while many irrationality proofs depend only on elementary
      properties of numbers, the proof that a number is transcendental usually involves

      21. e is Transcendental 443  

      some really high-powered mathematics. Even the dates connected with the transcendence of e are impressively recent—the first proof that e is transcendental, due to Hermite, dates from 1873. The proof that we will give is a simplification, due to Hilbert.

      Before tackling the proof itself, it is a good idea to map out the strategy, which depends on an idea used even in the proof that e is irrational. 'Two features of the expression  

      | | |  
      I! 2!  

      were important for the proof that e is irrational: On the one hand, the number  
      , | |  

      can be written as a fraction p/q with q <n! (so that n! (p/q) is an integer); on the other hand, 0 < R, < 3/(n+ 1)! (so n!R, is not an integer). These two facts show that e can be approximated particularly well by rational numbers. Of course, every number x can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers—if ¢ > O there is a rational number r with |x —r| < €; the catch, however, is that it may be necessary to allow a very large denominator for r, as large as |/e perhaps. For e we are assured that this is not the case: there is a fraction p/g within 3/(n + 1)! of e, whose denominator gq is at most n!. If you look carefully at the proof that e is irrational, you will see that only this fact about e is ever used. The number e is by no means unique in this respect: generally speaking, the better a number can be approximated by rational numbers, the worse it is (some evidence for this assertion is presented in Problem 3). The proof that e is transcendental depends on a natural extension of this idea: not only e, but any finite number of powers e, e? can be simultaneously approximated especially well by rational numbers. In our proof we will begin by assuming that e is algebraic, so that

      THEOREM 1

      PROOF

      The first term in brackets is an integer, and we will choose the M's so that it will
      necessarily be a nonzero integer. We will also manage to find €'s so small that

      lea, +-+- + €nan| < x

      this will lead to the desired contradiction—the sum of a nonzero integer and a
      number of absolute value less than . cannot be zero!

      As a basic strategy this is all very reasonable and quite straightforward. ‘The
      remarkable part of the proof will be the way that the M's and e's are defined. In
      order to read the proof you will need to know about the gamma function! (This
      function was introduced in Problem 19-40.)

      e 1s transcendental.

      Suppose there were integers ao, ... , dn, with ag # O, such that

      ey =e | xP~"l[(x — 1)-...-(a —n)]?e dx.
      0 (p — 1)!
      - |-
      The unspecified number p represents a prime number* which we will choose later.
      Despite the forbidding aspect of these three expressions, with a little work they will
      appear much more reasonable. We concentrate on M first. If the expression in
      brackets,

      [((x —1)-...-@—na")],
      is actually multiplied out, we obtain a polynomial

      x" 4+.--4+n!

      * The term "prime number" was defined in Problem 2-17. An important fact about prime numbers
      will be used in the proof, although it is not proved in this book: If p is a prime number which does
      not divide the integer a, and which does not divide the integer b, then p also does not divide ab.
      The Suggested Reading mentions references for this theorem (which is crucial in proving that the
      factorization of an integer into primes is unique). We will also use the result of Problem 2-17(d),
      that there are infinitely many primes——the reader is asked to determine at precisely which points this
      information 1s required.

      more complicated polynomial

      Thus M can be written in the form

      where the Cy, are certain integers, and Co = +(n!)?. But

      Now, for a = O we obtain the term
      (p— 1)!
      +(n!)? = +(n!)?.
      (p — 1)!

      We will now consider only primes p > n; then this term is an integer which 1s not
      divisible by p. On the other hand, if @ > O, then

      (p—l1+a)!

      This can be transformed into an expression looking very much like M by the

      The limits of integration are changed to 0 and oo, and
      vl -[° (u tk? '[mM@tk—1)-... ue... utk=n)]Pe™

      There is one very significant difference between this expression and that for M.
      The term in brackets contains the factor u in the kth place. Thus the pth power
      contains the factor u?. This means that the entire expression

      in this case every term in the sum 1s divisible by p. Thus each M, is an integer
      which zs divisible by p.
      Now it 1s clear that

      In addition to requiring that p > n let us also stipulate that p > |ao|. This means
      that both M and ag are not divisible by p, so agM 1s also not divisible by p. Since
      each M, 1s divisible by p, it follows that

      It is not divisible by p. In particular it is a nonzero integer.
      In order to obtain a contradiction to the assumed equation (*), and thereby
      prove that e is transcendental, it is only necessary to show that

      $$ \left| a_1e + a_2e^2 + \cdots + a_ne^n \right| $$

      can be made as small as desired, by choosing p large enough; it is clearly sufficient
      to show that each $ |a_ie^i| $ can be made as small as desired. This requires nothing more
      than some simple estimates; for the remainder of the argument remember that n
      is a certain fixed number (the degree of the assumed polynomial equation (+)). To
      begin with, if $ 1 < k < n $, then

      $$ \int_0^\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k e^{px} dx $$

      $$ = \int_0^\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k e^{px} dx $$

      $$ = \int_0^\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k e^{px} dx $$

      $$ = \int_0^\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k e^{px} dx $$

      $$ = \int_0^\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k e^{px} dx $$

      Now let A be the maximum of $ |(x - 1)...-(x - n)| $ for x in [0,7]. Then

      $$ \left| \int_0^\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k e^{px} dx \right| < e^p n A \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-x} (x - p)^k}{(p - 1)!} dx $$

      $$ = \frac{e^p n A}{(p - 1)!} \int_0^\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k dx $$

      $$ < \frac{e^p n A}{(p - 1)!} \int_0^\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k dx $$

      $$ = \frac{e^p n A}{(p - 1)!} \int_0^\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k dx $$

      $$ < \frac{e^p n A}{(p - 1)!} \int_0^\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k dx $$

      $$ = \frac{e^p n A}{(p - 1)!} \int_0^\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k dx $$

      $$ = \frac{e^p n A}{(p - 1)!} \int_0^\infty e^{-x} (x - p)^k dx $$

      But n and A are fixed; thus $ \frac{(nA)^p}{(p - 1)!} $ can be made as small as desired by
      making p sufficiently large. J

      This proof, like the proof that $ e $ is irrational, deserves some philosophic afterthoughts. At first sight, the argument seems quite "advanced"—after all, we
      use integrals, and integrals from 0 to ∞ at that. Actually, as many mathematicians have observed, integrals can be eliminated from the argument completely;
      the only integrals essential to the proof are of the form

      $$ \int_0^\infty x^k e^{-x} dx $$
      - |-
      for integral k, and these integrals can be replaced by k! whenever they occur.
      Thus M, for example, could have been defined initially as

      $$
      M = \frac{(p-1+a)!}{(p-1)!}
      $$

      where $ C_y $ are the coefficients of the polynomial
      $$
      [((x-1)-\cdots-(a_n))]^2.
      $$

      If this idea is developed consistently, one obtains a "completely elementary" proof
      that $ e $ is transcendental, depending only on the fact that

      $$
      | I I 
      $$

      Unfortunately, this "elementary" proof is harder to understand than the original
      one—the whole structure of the proof must be hidden just to eliminate a few
      integral signs! ‘This situation is by no means peculiar to this specific theorem—
      "elementary" arguments are frequently more difficult than "advanced" ones. Our
      proof that $ \zeta $ is irrational is a case in point. You probably remember nothing
      about this proof except that it involves quite a few complicated functions. There is
      actually a more advanced, but much more conceptual proof, which shows that $ \pi $
      is transcendental, a fact which is of great historical, as well as intrinsic, interest. One
      of the classical problems of Greek mathematics was to construct, with compass
      and straightedge alone, a square whose area is that of a circle of radius 1. This
      requires the construction of a line segment whose length is $ \pi $, which can be
      accomplished if a line segment of length $ \pi $ is constructible. The Greeks were
      totally unable to decide whether such a line segment could be constructed, and
      even the full resources of modern mathematics were unable to settle this question
      until 1882. In that year Lindemann proved that $ \pi $ is transcendental; since the
      length of any segment that can be constructed with straightedge and compass can
      be written in terms of $ +, -, \times, \div, $ and $ \sqrt{} $, and is therefore algebraic, this proves
      that a line segment of length $ \pi $ cannot be constructed.

      The proof that $ \pi $ is transcendental requires a sizable amount of mathematics
      which is too advanced to be reached in this book. Nevertheless, the proof is not
      much more difficult than the proof that $ e $ is transcendental. In fact, the proof

      for z is practically the same as the proof for e. This last statement should certainly
      surprise you. The proof that e is transcendental seems to depend so thoroughly
      on particular properties of e that it is almost inconceivable how any modifications
      could ever be used for 7; after all, what does e have to do with 2? Just wait and

      Although Problem 4 mentions only one specific transcendental number, it should be clear that one can easily construct infinitely many other numbers α which do not satisfy |α - p/q| > c/q^n for any c and n. Such numbers were first considered by Liouville (1809-1882), and the inequality in Problem 3 is often called Liouville's inequality. None of the transcendental numbers constructed in this way happens to be particularly interesting, but for a long time Liouville's transcendental numbers were the only ones known. This situation was changed quite radically by the work of Cantor (1845-1918), who showed, without exhibiting a single transcendental number, that most numbers are transcendental. The next two problems provide an introduction to the ideas that allow us to make sense of such statements. The basic definition with which we must work is the following: A set A is called countable if its elements can be arranged in a sequence

      a1, a2, a3, a4, ....

      The obvious example (in fact, more or less the Platonic ideal of) a countable set is N, the set of natural numbers; clearly the set of even natural numbers is also countable:

      2, 4, 6, 8, ....

      It is a little more surprising to learn that Z, the set of all integers (positive, negative and 0) is also countable, but seeing it is believing:

      0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, ....

      The next two problems, which outline the basic features of countable sets, are really a series of examples to show that (1) a lot more sets are countable than one might think and (2) nevertheless, some sets are not countable.

      (f) Prove that the set of all n-tuples (a1, a2,..., an) is countable. (If you have done part (e), you can do this, using induction.)

      (g) Prove that the set of all roots of polynomial functions of degree n with integer coefficients is countable. (Part (f) shows that the set of all these polynomial functions can be arranged in a sequence, and each has at most n roots.)

      Q2 = 0.a21a22a23a24...

      is countable. If the set of transcendental numbers were also countable, then the
      set of all real numbers would be countable, by Problem 5(a), and consequently the
      set of real numbers between O and 1 would be countable. But this is false. ‘Thus,

      to be differentiable at a set of points which is not countable, but it 1s still

      rigorous definition of an infinite sequence is not hard to formulate, however; the
      important point about an infinite sequence is that for each natural number, n,
      there is a real number a,,. This sort of correspondence is precisely what functions
      are meant to formalize.

      An infinite sequence of real numbers is a function whose domain is N.

      From the point of view of this definition, a sequence should be designated by a
      single letter like a, and particular values by

      a(1), a(2), a(3),...,

      but the subscript notation
      a|, a2, Q3,...

      is almost always used instead, and the sequence itself is usually denoted by a symbol

      A more convenient representation of a sequence is obtained by simply labeling the points aj, a2, a3, ... on a line (Figure 2). This sort of picture shows where the sequence "is going." The sequence {a@,} "goes out to infinity," the sequence {B,} "jumps back and forth between —1 and 1," and the sequence {y,} "converges to 0." Of the three phrases in quotation marks, the last is the crucial concept associated with sequences, and will be defined precisely (the definition is illustrated in Figure 3).

      In addition to the terminology introduced in this definition, we sometimes say that the sequence {a,} approaches / or has the limit J. A sequence {a,} is said to converge if it converges to / for some /, and to diverge if it does not converge.

      practically the same as Vn for large n), but a mathematical proof might not be so  
      obvious. To estimate Vn + 1 — Vn we can use an algebraic trick:

      _ (nt l= vnyi/n+14+yn)  
      vntl—vn= vn+l+vyn  

      n+l—n  

      vn tl +n

      ~ Vntl+vn  

      It is also possible to estimate Yn + 1 — vn by applying the Mean Value Theorem  
      to the function f(x) = x on the interval [n,n + 1]. We obtain

      is left to you, as a simple but valuable exercise.

      should also seem reasonable, because the terms involving n°? are the most impor-  
      tant when n is large. If you remember the proof of Theorem 7-9 you will be able  
      to guess the trick that translates this idea into a proof—dividing top and bottom

      (If we wanted to be utterly precise, the third statement would have to be even
      more complicated. As it stands, we are considering the limit of the sequence
      {Cn} = {@n/bn}, where the numbers c, might not even be defined for certain n < N.
      This doesn't really matter—we could define c, any way we liked for such n—
      because the limit of a sequence is not changed if we change the sequence at a
      finite number of points.)

      Although these facts are very useful, we will not bother stating them as a
      theorem—you should have no difficulty proving these results for yourself, because
      the definition of im a, = lis so similar to previous definitions of limits, especially
      lim fi=l.

      THEOREM 1  

      PROOF  

      The behavior of the logarithm function also shows that if a > 1, then a" be-  
      comes arbitrarily large as n becomes large. ‘This assertion is often written

      and say that {—a"} approaches —oo. Notice, however, that if a < —1, then lim a"  
      n— OO  

      does not exist, even in this extended sense.  

      Despite this connection with a familiar concept, it is more important to visualize  
      convergence in terms of the picture of a sequence as points on a line (Figure 3).  
      There 1s another connection between limits of functions and limits of sequences  
      which 1s related to this picture. ‘This connection is somewhat less obvious, but con-  
      siderably more interesting, than the one previously mentioned—uinstead of defining  
      liamits of sequences in terms of limits of functions, it 1s possible to reverse the pro-  
      cedure.  

      Let f be a function defined in an open interval containing c, except perhaps at c

      Then the sequence { f(a,)} satishes

      Suppose, conversely, that $ \lim_{n \to \infty} f(a_n) = l $ for every sequence $ \{a_n\} $ with $ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = c $. If $ \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = l $ were not true, there would be some $ \epsilon > 0 $ such that for every $ \delta > 0 $ there is an $ x $ with

      0 < |x - c| < \delta \quad \text{but} \quad |f(x) - l| > \epsilon.

      $$
      0 < |x_n - c| < \frac{\epsilon}{n} \quad \text{but} \quad |f(x_n) - l| > \epsilon.

      Now the sequence $ \{x_n\} $ clearly converges to $ c $ but, since $ |f(x_n) - l| > \epsilon $ for all $ n $, the sequence $ \{f(x_n)\} $ does not converge to $ l $. This contradicts the hypothesis, so

      Clearly converge to sin(13) and cos(sin(1)), respectively. It is important, however,
      to have some criteria guaranteeing convergence of sequences which are not obvi-
      ously of this sort. There is one important criterion which is very easy to prove, but
      which is the basis for all other results. 'This criterion is stated in terms of concepts
      defined for functions, which therefore apply also to sequences: a sequence {a_n} is
      increasing if a_{n+1} > a_n for all n, nondecreasing if a_{n+1} > a_n for all n, and
      bounded above if there is a number M such that a_n < M for all n; there are sim-
      ilar definitions for sequences which are decreasing, nonincreasing, and bounded
      below.

      If {a_n} is nondecreasing and bounded above, then {a_n} converges (a similar state-
      ment is true if {a_n} is nonincreasing and bounded below).

      The set A consisting of all numbers a_n is, by assumption, bounded above, so A has
      a least upper bound a. We claim that lim a_n = a (Figure 5). In fact, if ε > 0,

      n→∞

      there is some a_n satisfying a - a_n < ε, since a is the least upper bound of A.
      Then if n > N we have

      a_n > a_1, so |a - a_n| < ε.

      This proves that lim a_n = a. J
      n→∞

      The hypothesis that {a_n} is bounded above is clearly essential in Theorem 2: if
      {a_n} is not bounded above, then (whether or not {a_n} is nondecreasing) {a_n} clearly
      diverges. Upon first consideration, it might appear that there should be little
      trouble deciding whether or not a given nondecreasing sequence {a_n} is bounded
      above, and consequently whether or not {a_n} converges. In the next chapter such
      sequences will arise very naturally and, as we shall see, deciding whether or not
      they converge is hardly a trivial matter. For the present, you might try to decide
      whether or not the following (obviously increasing) sequence is bounded above:

      Although Theorem 2 treats only a very special class of sequences, it is more
      useful than might appear at first, because it 1s always possible to extract from an
      arbitrary sequence {a,} another sequence which is either nonincreasing or else
      nondecreasing. ‘To be precise, let us define a subsequence of the sequence {a,}
      to be a sequence of the form

      Then every sequence contains a subsequence which is either nondecreasing or
      nonincreasing. It 1s possible to become quite befuddled trying to prove this as-
      sertion, although the proof is very short if you think of the right idea; it is worth
      recording as a lemma.

      FIGURE 6

      LEMMA Any sequence {a,} contains a subsequence which 1s either nondecreasing or non-

      PROOF ~~ Call a natural number n a "peak point" of the sequence {a,} if dm < da, for all
      m > n (Figure 6).

      Case 1. The sequence has infinitely many peak points. In this case, if ny < n2 <
      n3 <.--- are the peak points, then a,, > Gn, > Gn; > +++, SO {An,} 1s the desired
      (nonincreasing) subsequence.

      Case 2. The sequence has only finitely many peak points. In this case, let n; be greater
      than all peak points. Since n, is not a peak point, there is some n2 > ny such that
      Gn, = An,. Since nz 1s not a peak point (it is greater than nj, and hence greater
      than all peak points) there is some n3 > n2 such that a,, > a,,. Continuing in this
      way we obtain the desired (nondecreasing) subsequence. J

      If we assume that our original sequence {a,} 1s bounded, we can pick up an
      extra corollary along the way.

      DEFINITION

      THEOREM 3

      PROOF

      22. Infinite Sequences 459

      Without some additional assumptions this is as far as we can go: it is easy to
      construct sequences having many, evenly infinitely many, subsequences converg-
      ing to different numbers (see Problem 3). ‘There is a reasonable assumption to
      add, which yields a necessary and sufficient condition for convergence of any se-
      quence. Although this condition will not be crucial for our work, it does simplify
      many proofs. Moreover, this condition plays a fundamental role in more advanced
      investigations, and for this reason alone it is worth stating now.

      If a sequence converges, so that the individual terms are eventually all close to
      the same number, then the difference of any two such individual terms should be

      very small. ‘To be precise, if lim a, = / for some /, then for any ¢ > O there is

      an N such that Ja, —1| < e/2 forn > N; nowif both n > N and m > N, then

      2 2
      This final inequality, ja, — a,| < €, which eliminates mention of the limit /, can
      be used to formulate a condition (the Cauchy condition) which is clearly necessary
      for convergence of a sequence.

      A sequence {a,} is a Gauchy sequence if for every € > O there is a natural
      number WN such that, for all m and n,

      ifm,n > N, then ja, — ay| < e.

      (This condition is usually written lim = |a,, — a,| = 0.)

      m,n CoO

      The beauty of the Cauchy condition is that it is also sufficient to ensure conver-
      gence of a sequence. After all our preliminary work, there is very little left to do
      in order to prove this.

      A sequence {a,} converges if and only if it is a Gauchy sequence.
      - |-
      We have already shown that {a,,} is a Cauchy sequence if it converges. 'The proof of
      the converse assertion contains only one tricky feature: showing that every Cauchy
      sequence {a,} is bounded. If we take ε = | in the definition of a Cauchy sequence
      we find that there is some N such that

      |Am — An| < | for m,n > N.
      In particular, this means that
      |Qm — An+1| < | for all m > N.

      Thus {a,, :m > N} is bounded; since there are only finitely many other a;'s the
      whole sequence is bounded.

      460 Infinite Sequences and Infinite Series

      The corollary to the Lemma thus implies that some subsequence of {a,} con-
      verges.

      Only one point remains, whose proof will be left to you: if a subsequence of a
      Cauchy sequence converges, then the Cauchy sequence itself converges. J

      In the Appendix to Chapter 8 we defined uniform continuity of a function

      sense: we say that f is uniformly continuous on an interval if for every ε > 0  
      there is some δ > 0 such that, if x and y are rational numbers in the interval  
      and |x — y| < δ, then | f(x) — f(y)| < ε.

      (a) Let x be any (rational or irrational) point in the interval, and let {x_n} be  
      a sequence of rational points in the interval such that lim x_n = x. Show

      (b) Prove that the limit of the sequence { f (x_n)} doesn't depend on the choice  
      of the sequence {x_n}.

      We will denote this limit by f(x), so that f is an extension of f to the  
      whole interval.

      (c) Prove that the extended function f is uniformly continuous on the inter-  
      val.

      Let a > 0, and for rational x let f(x) = a^x, as defined in the usual elementary  
      algebraic way. This problem shows directly that f can be extended to a  

      continuous function f on the whole line. Problem 28 provides the necessary  
      machinery.

      (a) For rational x < y, show that a^x < a^y for a > 1 and a^x > a^y for a < 1.

      (b) Using Problem 10, show that for any ε > 0 we have |a^x — a^y| < ε for  
      rational numbers x close enough to 0.

      (c) Using the equation a^x — a^y = a^x(a^y — 1), prove that on any closed  
      interval f is uniformly continuous, in the sense of Problem 28.

      (d) Show that the extended function f of Problem 28 is increasing for a > 1  
      and decreasing for a < 1 and satisfies f(x + y) = f(x) f(y).

      The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem is usually stated, and also proved, quite
      differently than in the text—the classical statement uses the notion of limit
      points. A point x is a limit point of the set A if for every ¢ > O there is a
      point a in A with |x —a| < ¢ but x #a.

      point of [a, b] is a limit point of A. Prove this in two ways:

      are distinct numbers x1, x2, x3,... in A.

      (e) Using the Nested Intervals Theorem. Hint: If [a, b] 1s divided into two
      intervals, at least one must contain infinitely many points of A.

      on [a,b], then f 1s bounded above on [a, b]. Hint: If f 1s not bounded
      above, then there are points xn in [a,b] with f(xn) > n.

      CHAPTER

      INFINITE SERIES

      Infinite sequences were introduced in the previous chapter with the specific intention of considering their "sums"

      a1 + a2 + a3 + ...

      in this chapter. This is not an entirely straightforward matter, for the sum of  
      infinitely many numbers is as yet completely undefined. What can be defined are  
      the "partial sums"

      Sn = a1 + a2 + ... + an,

      and the infinite sum must presumably be defined in terms of these partial sums.  
      Fortunately, the mechanism for formulating this definition has already been devel-  
      oped in the previous chapter. If there is to be any hope of computing the infinite  
      sum a1 + a2 + a3 + ..., the partial sums s_n should represent closer and closer ap-  
      proximations as n is chosen larger and larger. This last assertion amounts to little  
      more than a sloppy definition of limits: the "infinite sum" a1 + a2 + a3 + ... ought  
      to be lim s_n. This approach will necessarily leave the "sum" of many sequences  
      N → ∞

      undefined, since the sequence {s_n} may easily fail to have a limit. For example, the  
      sequence

      1, -1, 1, -1, ...
      with a_n = (-1)^{n+1} yields the new sequence

      S_1 = a_1 = 1,

      S_2 = a_1 + a_2 = 0,

      S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1,

      S_4 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 0,

      ... for which lim s_n does not exist. Although there happen to be some clever ex-  
      tensions of the definition suggested here (see Problems 12 and 24-20) it seems  
      unavoidable that some sequences will have no sum. For this reason, an acceptable  
      definition of the sum of a sequence should contain, as an essential component,  
      terminology which distinguishes sequences for which sums can be defined from  
      less fortunate sequences.

      DEFINITION  

      The sequence {a_n} is summable if the sequence {S_n} converges, where  
      S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n.  

      In this case, lim S_n is denoted by  
      n→∞  

      ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n (or, less formally, a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ...)  

      and is called the sum of the sequence {a_n}.  

      The terminology introduced in this definition is usually replaced by less precise  
      expressions; indeed the title of this chapter is derived from such everyday language.  

      An infinite sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n is usually called an infinite series, the word "series" emphasiz-  
      ing the connection with the infinite sequence {a_n}. ‘The statement that {a_n} is, or  
      is not, summable is conventionally replaced by the statement that the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n  
      does, or does not, converge. ‘This terminology is somewhat peculiar, because at  
      best the symbol ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n denotes a number (so it can't "converge''), and it doesn't de-  
      note anything at all unless {a_n} is summable. Nevertheless, this informal language  
      is convenient, standard, and unlikely to yield to attacks on logical grounds.  

      Certain elementary arithmetical operations on infinite series are direct conse-  
      quences of the definition. It is a simple exercise to show that if {a_n} and {b_n} are  
      summable, then  

      ∑_{n=1}^∞ (a_n + b_n) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n + ∑_{n=1}^∞ b_n,  
      ∑_{n=1}^∞ c a_n = c ∑_{n=1}^∞ a_n.  

      As yet these equations are not very interesting, since we have no examples of  
      summable sequences (except for the trivial examples in which the terms are even-  
      tually all 0). Before we actually exhibit a summable sequence, some general con-  
      ditions for summability will be recorded.  

      There is one necessary and sufficient condition for summability which can be  
      stated immediately. The sequence {a_n} is summable if and only if the sequence {S_n}  
      converges, which happens, according to Theorem 22-3, if and only if lim S_n -  
      n→∞

      The sequence {a,} is summable if and only if

      Although the Cauchy criterion is of theoretical importance, it is not very useful
      for deciding the summability of any particular sequence. However, one simple
      consequence of the Cauchy criterion provides a necessary condition for summability
      which is too important not to be mentioned explicitly.

      If {a,} 1s summable, then

      lim a, = 0.
      n—>©Oo

      This condition follows from the Cauchy criterion by taking m =n + 1; it can also

      be proved directly as follows. If lim s, = /, then

      lim a, = lim (s, — S,-1) = lim s, — lim s,_1

      Unfortunately, this condition is far from sufficient. For example, lim 1/n = 0,
      n> Oo

      but the sequence {1/n} 1s not summable; in fact, the following grouping of the
      numbers |/n shows that the sequence {s,} 1s not bounded:

      = 2 =—2 =—2
      (2 terms, (4 terms, (8 terms,
      each > i) each > x) each > ik)

      The method of proof used in this example, a clever trick which one might never
      see, reveals the need for some more standard methods for attacking these problems.

      These methods shall be developed soon (one of them will give an alternate proof

      that \" 1/n does not converge) but it will be necessary to first procure a few

      Special as they are, geometric series are standard examples from which important
      tests for summability will be derived.

      For a while we shall consider only sequences {a_n} with each a_n > 0; such
      sequences are called nonnegative. If {a_n} is a nonnegative sequence, then the se-
      quence {s_n} is clearly nondecreasing. ‘This remark, combined with Theorem 22-2,
      provides a simple-minded test for summability:

      By itself, this criterion is not very helpful—deciding whether or not the set of all s, is bounded is just what we are unable to do. On the other hand, if some convergent series are already available for comparison, this criterion can be used to obtain a result whose simplicity belies its importance (it is the basis for almost all other tests).

      Quite frequently the comparison test can be used to analyze very complicated looking series in which most of the complication is irrelevant. For example,

      Suppose $\sum b_n$ converges. Since $\lim \frac{a_n}{b_n} = c$, there is some $N$ such that
      $$
      n \to \infty
      $$

      $$
      a_n < 2cb_n, \text{ for } n > N.
      $$

      $$
      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \text{ certainly converges. Then Theorem 1 shows that}
      $$

      $$
      \sum_{n=N}^{\infty} a_n \text{ converges, and this implies convergence of the whole series } \sum a_n,
      $$

      $$
      \text{which has only finitely many additional terms.}
      $$

      The converse follows immediately, since we also have $\lim \frac{b_n}{a_n} = \frac{1}{c} \leq 0$. 

      $$
      n \to \infty
      $$

      The comparison test yields other important tests when we use previously analyzed series as catalysts. Choosing the geometric series $\sum r^n$, the convergent series par excellence, we obtain the most important of all tests for summability.

      Let $a_n > 0$ for all $n$, and suppose that

      $$
      \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = r
      $$

      Then $\sum a_n$ converges if $r < 1$. On the other hand, if $r > 1$, then the terms $a_n$ are unbounded, so $\sum a_n$ diverges. (Notice that it is therefore essential to compute

      $$
      \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}!
      $$

      Suppose first that $r < 1$. Choose any number $s$ with $r < s < 1$. The hypothesis

      $$
      \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = r < 1
      $$

      implies that there is some $N$ such that

      $$
      a_{n+1} < s \text{ for } n > N.
      $$

      This can be written

      $$
      a_{n+1} < s a_n \text{ for } n > N.
      $$

      Thus

      $$
      a_{n+1} < s a_n,
      $$

      $$
      a_{n+2} < s a_{n+1} < s^2 a_n,
      $$

      $$
      a_{n+k} < s^k a_n \text{ for } k \geq 1.
      $$

      $$
      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \text{ certainly converges. Then Theorem 1 shows that}
      $$

      $$
      \sum_{n=N}^{\infty} a_n \text{ converges, and this implies convergence of the whole series } \sum a_n,
      $$

      $$
      \text{which has only finitely many additional terms.}
      $$

      The case $r > 1$ is even easier. If $1 < s < r$, then there is a number $N$ such that

      $$
      \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} > s \text{ for } n > N.
      $$

      This implies that

      $$
      a_{n+1} > s a_n \text{ for } n > N.
      $$

      Therefore,

      $$
      a_{n+k} > s^k a_n \text{ for } k \geq 1.
      $$

      This shows that the terms $a_n$ grow without bound, so $\sum a_n$ diverges.

      \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{A_{n+1}}{A_n} = 0,

      so that $\sum \frac{r^n}{n!}$ converges. It follows that

      THEOREM 4 (THE INTEGRAL TEST)

      PROOF

      a result already proved in Chapter 16 (the proof given there was based on the same

      ideas as those used in the ratio test). Finally, if we consider the series $\sum n r'$,
      $$
      n=1|
      $$
      we have

      $$
      \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{(n+1) r'}{n r'} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n+1}{n} = 1.
      $$

      since $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n + 1}{n} = 1$. This proves that if $0 < r < 1$, then $\sum n r'$ converges,

      $$
      n=|
      $$

      and consequently

      $$
      \lim_{n \to \infty} n r' = 0.
      $$

      (This result clearly holds for $-1 < r < 0$, also.) It is a useful exercise to provide a
      direct proof of this limit, without using the ratio test as an intermediary.
      Although the ratio test will be of the utmost theoretical importance, as a practical
      tool it will frequently be found disappointing. One drawback of the ratio test is
      the fact that $\lim \frac{A_{n+1}}{A_n}$ may be quite difficult to determine, and may not even

      The limit might equal 1. The case lim a_n / a_{n+1} = 1 is precisely the one which is inconclusive: {a_n} might not be summable (for example, if a_n = 1/n), but then again it might be. In fact, our very next test will show that Σ 1/n^2 converges, even though

      This test provides a quite different method for determining convergence or divergence of infinite series—like the ratio test, it is an immediate consequence of the comparison test, but the series chosen for comparison is quite novel.

      Suppose that f is positive and decreasing on [1, ∞), and that f(n) = a_n for all n.

      Then Σ a_n converges if and only if the limit

      lim [f(n)] exists.

      n→∞

      The existence of lim [f(n)] is equivalent to convergence of the series

      Σ f(n).

      n=1

      Now, since f is decreasing we have (Figure 2)

      f(n+1) < ∫_{n}^{n+1} f(x) dx < f(n).

      The first half of this double inequality shows that the series Σ a_{n+1} may be compared to the series ∫ f(x) dx, proving that Σ a_{n+1} (and hence Σ a_n) converges

      if lim exists.

      The second half of the inequality shows that the series ∫ f(x) dx may be compared to the series Σ a_n, proving that lim ∫ f(x) dx must exist if Σ a_n converges.

      Only one example using the integral test will be given here, but it settles the

      question of convergence for infinitely many series at once. If p > 0, the convergence of Σ 1/n^p is equivalent, by the integral test, to the existence of

      ∫_{1}^{∞} 1/x^p dx.

      ∫_{1}^{∞} 1/x^p dx = [x^{-p+1}/(-p+1)] from 1 to ∞ = (0 - 1/(-p+1)) = 1/(p-1).

      Thus, the series Σ 1/n^p converges if p > 1 and diverges if p ≤ 1.

      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \text{ is a sequence with both positive and negative terms, one can consider instead the sequence } \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n|, \text{ all of whose terms are nonnegative.}
      $$

      Cheerfully ignoring the possibility that we may have thrown away all the interesting information about the original sequence, we proceed to eulogize those sequences which are converted by this procedure into convergent sequences.

      $$
      \text{The series } \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \text{ is absolutely convergent if the series } \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n| \text{ is convergent.}
      $$

      $$
      (\text{In more formal language, the sequence } \{a_n\} \text{ is absolutely summable if the sequence } \{|a_n|\} \text{ is summable.})
      $$

      Although we have no right to expect this definition to be of any interest, it turns out to be exceedingly important. The following theorem shows that the definition is at least not entirely useless.

      $$
      \text{Every absolutely convergent series is convergent. Moreover, a series is absolutely convergent if and only if the series formed from its positive terms and the series formed from its negative terms both converge.}
      $$

      $$
      \text{If } \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n| \text{ converges, then, by the Cauchy criterion,}
      $$

      $$
      \lim_{m,N \to \infty} |a_{n+m}| + \cdots + |a_n| = 0.
      $$

      Since
      $$
      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n| < |a_{n+m}| + \cdots + |a_n|,
      $$

      it follows that
      $$
      \lim_{m,N \to \infty} a_{n+m} + \cdots + a_n = 0.
      $$

      It follows from ‘Theorem 5 that every convergent series with positive terms can  
      be used to obtain infinitely many other convergent series, ‘simply by putting in  
      minus signs at random. Not every convergent series can be obtained in this way,  
      however—there are series which are convergent but not absolutely convergent  
      (such series are called conditionally convergent). In order to prove this state-  
      ment we need a test for convergence which applies specifically to series with positive  
      and negative terms.

      this result says something about the actual sums. Generally speaking, there is
      no reason to presume that a given infinite sum can be "evaluated" in any simpler
      terms. However, many simple expressions can be equated to infinite sums by using
      Taylor's Theorem. Chapter 20 provides many examples of functions for which

      The next two problems examine, with hints, some infinite series that require

      more delicate analysis than those in Problem 1.

      *2.

      *3.

      (a) If you have successfully solved examples (xix) and (xx) from Problem 1,

      it should be clear that $\frac{a^n}{n!}$ converges for $a < e$ and diverges for

      $n= |$
      $a > e$. For $a = e$ the ratio test fails; show that $\sum \frac{e^n}{n!}$ actually

      (b) Decide when $\sum \frac{y^n}{a n!}$ converges, again resorting to Problem 22-13

      $n=1$

      Problem 1 presented the two series $\sum \frac{1}{(\log n)^k}$ and $\sum \frac{1}{(\log n)^m}$, of which

      $n=2 \quad n=2$
      the first diverges while the second converges. The series

      $\sum \frac{1}{(\log n)^{0.8}}$

      which lies between these two, is analyzed in parts (a) and (b).

      (a) Show that $\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{e^x}{x^2} dx$ exists, by considering the series $\sum \left(\frac{e}{n}\right)^2$.
      $n=1$

      (b) Show that

      $\sum \frac{1}{(\log n)^{0.8}}$

      converges, by using the integral test. Hint: Use an appropriate substitution and part (a).
      (c) Show that

      $\sum \frac{1}{(\log n)^{0.8}}$

      diverges, by using the integral test. Hint: Use the same substitution as
      in part (b), and show directly that the resulting integral diverges.

      **Prove that if $f''(0)$ exists and $f(0) = f'(0) = 0$, then $\sum a_n$ converges.**

      **Suppose $\sum a_n$ converges. Must $f'(0)$ exist?**

      **Suppose $f(0) = f'(0) = 0$. Must $\sum a_n$ converge?**

      **Let $\{a_n\}$ be a sequence of integers with $0 < a_n < 9$. Prove that there exists $a_n$ such that $\sum a_n 10^{-n}$ exists (and lies between 0 and 1). (This, of course, is the number which we usually denote by $0.a_1a_2a_3a_4\ldots$).**

      **Suppose that $0 < x < 1$. Prove that there is a sequence of integers $\{a_n\}$ with $0 < a_n < 9$ and $\sum a_n 10^{-n} = x$. Hint: For example, $a_1 = [10x]$ (where $[y]$ denotes the greatest integer which is < y).**

      **Show that if $\{a_n\}$ is repeating, i.e., is of the form $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, \ldots$, then $\sum a_n 10^{-n}$ is a rational number (and find it). The same result naturally holds if $\{a_n\}$ is eventually repeating, i.e., if the sequence $\{a_{n+k}\}$ is repeating for some $N$.**

      It is easy to construct series for which the ratio test fails, while the root

      $$
      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}

      is related to the following remarkable fact: Any positive rational number x can be written as a finite sum of distinct numbers of the form $\frac{1}{n}$. The idea of the proof is shown by the following calculation for x: Since  

      $$
      \frac{27}{31} = \frac{23}{2^4} + \frac{7}{3^2} - \frac{1}{86}
      $$

      $$
      $$
      \frac{1}{86} = \frac{1}{2^7}
      $$
      $$
      \frac{1}{186} = \frac{1}{2^7}
      $$
      we have  
      $$
      \frac{27}{31} = \frac{23}{2^4} + \frac{7}{3^2} - \frac{1}{86}

      (a) Prove that if $\frac{1}{n+1} < x < \frac{1}{n}$ for some n, then the numerator in this sort of calculation must always decrease; conclude that x can be written as a finite sum of distinct numbers $\frac{1}{k}$.

      (b) Now prove the result for all x by using the divergence of $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}$.

      A UNIFORM CONVERGENCE AND  
      CHAPTER POWER SERIES

      FIGURE 1

      The considerations at the end of the previous chapter suggest an entirely new way  
      of looking at infinite series. Our attention will shift from particular infinite sums  
      to equations like  
      $$
      x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n
      $$
      which concern sums of quantities that depend on x. In other words, we are  
      interested in functions defined by equations of the form  

      $$
      f(x) = f_0(x) + f_1(x) + f_2(x) + \cdots
      $$

      (in the previous example $f_n(x) = x^n / n!$). In such a situation $\{ f_n \}$ will be  
      some sequence of functions; for each x we obtain a sequence of numbers $\{ f_n(x) \}$, and $f(x)$ is the sum of this sequence. In order to analyze such functions it will  
      certainly be necessary to remember that each sum  
      $$
      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}
      $$  
      diverges.

      $$
      f(x) + f(x) + f(x) + \cdots
      $$

      is, by definition, the limit of the sequence

      $$
      f(x), f(x) + f(x), f(x) + f(x), f(x) + f(x) + f(x), \cdots
      $$

      If we define a new sequence of functions $\{s_n\}$ by

      $$
      s_n(x) = f(x) + f(x) + \cdots + f(x)
      $$

      then we can express this fact more succinctly by writing
      $$
      f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} s_n(x)
      $$

      For some time we shall therefore concentrate on functions defined as limits,
      $$
      \lim_{n \to \infty}
      $$

      rather than on functions defined as infinite sums. The total body of results about
      such functions can be summed up very easily: nothing one would hope to be
      true actually is—instead we have a splendid collection of counterexamples. The
      first of these shows that even if each $f_n$ is continuous, the function $f$ may not be!
      Contrary to what you may expect, the functions $f_n$ will be very simple. Figure |
      shows the graphs of the functions

      $$
      x^n, 0 < x < 1
      $$

      $$
      1 \text{ for } x = 1
      $$

      These functions are all continuous, but the function $f(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x)$ is not
      continuous; in fact,

      $$
      f(x) = 
      \begin{cases}
      0, & 0 < x < 1 \\
      1, & x = 1
      \end{cases}
      $$

      Another example of this same phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 2; the func-
      tions $f_n$ are defined by

      $$
      f_n(x) = 
      \begin{cases}
      -1, & x < 0 \\
      0, & x = 0 \\
      1, & x > 0
      \end{cases}
      $$

      In this case, if $x < 0$, then $f_n(x)$ is eventually (i.e., for large enough $n$) equal to $-1$,

      and if $x > 0$, then $f_n(x)$ is eventually $1$, while $f_n(0) = 0$ for all $n$. Thus

      $$
      \lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(x) = 
      \begin{cases}
      -1, & x < 0 \\
      0, & x = 0 \\
      1, & x > 0
      \end{cases}
      $$
      - |-
      So, once again, the function f(x) = lim f_n(x) is not continuous.  
      n→∞

      By rounding off the corners in the previous examples it is even possible to produce a sequence of differentiable functions {f_n} for which the function f(x) = lim f_n(x) is not continuous. One such sequence is easy to define explicitly:  
      n→∞

      f_n(x) = 4 sin(πx/2n) - 1, for example.  
      " 2 J? nn  
      l  
      I, — <X  
      n

      These functions are differentiable (Figure 3), but we still have  

      lim f(x) = { -1, x < 0  
      n→∞    0, x = 0  
           1, x > 0 }

      Continuity and differentiability are, moreover, not the only properties for which problems arise. Another difficulty is illustrated by the sequence {f_n} shown in Figure 4; on the interval [0, 1/n] the graph of f_n forms an isosceles triangle of altitude n, while f_n(x) = 0 for x > 1/n. These functions may be defined explicitly as follows:  
      f_n(x) = { 2n x, 0 < x < 1/(2n)  
                2n - 2n x, 1/(2n) < x < 1/n  
                0, x > 1/n }

                0, x > 1/n }

      Because this sequence varies so erratically near 0, our primitive mathematical instincts might suggest that lim f_n(x) does not always exist. Nevertheless, this  
      n→∞  
      lim f_n(x) does exist.

      limit does exist for all x, and the function f(x) = lim f(x) is even continuous.
      In fact, if x > O, then f,,(x) is eventually 0, so lim f(x) = Q; moreover, f,,(0) = 0
      for all n, so that we certainly have lm f,(0) = Q. In other words, f(x) =
      im fn(x) = O for all x. On the other hand, the integral quickly reveals the

      strange behavior of this sequence; we have

      1
      | fnr(x)dx = x

      but ;
      [ f(x)dx =0.

      This particular sequence of functions behaves in a way that we really never
      imagined when we first considered functions defined by limits. Although it is true
      that

      f(x) = lim f(x) for each x in [0, 1],

      the graphs of the functions f,, do not "approach" the graph of f in the sense of
      lying close to it—if, as in Figure 5, we draw a strip around f of total width 2¢ (al-
      lowing a width of € above and below), then the graphs of f,, do not lie completely
      within this strip, no matter how large an n we choose. Of course, for each x there
      is some N such that the point (x, f,(x)) lies in this strip for n > N; this assertion
      just amounts to the fact that im fn(x) = f(x). But it is necessary to choose larger

      and larger N's as x is chosen closer and closer to 0, and no one N will work for
      all x at once.

      The same situation actually occurs, though less blatantly, for each of the other
      examples given previously. Figure 6 illustrates this point for the sequence

      coordinate equal to 53 since each function f,, takes on the value ‘, the graph of

      f, each f, fails to lie within this strip. Once again, for each point x there is some N
      fi f such that (x, f,(x)) les in the strip for n > N; but it is not possible to pick one N
      which works for all x at once.
      J to It is easy to check that precisely the same situation occurs for each of the other
      he Se examples. In each case we have a function f, and a sequence of functions { fy},
      fi all defined on some set A, such that
      - A i f(x) = lm f(x) for all x in A.
      This means that

      FIGURE7 for all e¢ > O, and for all x in A, there is some N such that if n > N, then

      If (x) — fn(x)| < e.

      But in each case different N's must be chosen for different x's, and in each case it
      is not true that

      for all ¢ > O there is some WN such that for all x in A, if n > N, then

      | f(x) — fr(x)| < &.

      Although this condition differs from the first only by a minor displacement of the
      phrase "for all x in A," it has a totally different significance. If a sequence {f,}
      satisfies this second condition, then the graphs of f, eventually lie close to the
      graph of f, as illustrated in Figure 7. his condition turns out to be just the one
      which makes the study of limit functions feasible.

      DEFINITION Let {f,} be a sequence of functions defined on A, and let f be a function which
      is also defined on A. Then f is called the uniform limit of { f,} on A if for
      every € > O there 1s some N such that for all x in A,

      ifn > N, then | f(x) — fr(x)| < e.

      We also say that { f,} converges uniformly to f onA, or that f, approaches
      f uniformly on A.

      As a contrast to this definition, if we know only that

      f(x) = lm f, (x) for each x in A,

      then we say that {f,} converges pointwise to f on A. Clearly, uniform conver-
      gence implies pointwise convergence (but not conversely!).

      Evidence for the usefulness of uniform convergence is not at all difficult to amass.
      Integrals represent a particularly easy topic; Figure 7 makes it almost obvious that
      if {f,} converges uniformly to f, then the integral of f, can be made as close
      to the integral of f as desired. Expressed more precisely, we have the following
      theorem.

      THEOREM 1

      PROOF

      THEOREM 2

      PROOF

      24. Uniform Convergence and Power Series 503

      Suppose that {/f,} 1s a sequence of functions which are integrable on [a, b], and

      that {f,} converges uniformly on [a,b] to a function f which 1s integrable on
      [a,b]. Then

      [s- lim In
      Let ¢ > O. There is some N such that for all n > N we have

      If (x) — fn(x)| < € for all x in [a, b].

      Since this is true for any € > Q, it follows that

      [r=in f ful

      The treatment of continuity 1s only a little bit more difficult, involving an
      "e /3-argument," a three-step estimate of | f(x) — f(x +h)|. If {fr} 1s a sequence
      of continuous functions which converges uniformly to f, then there is some n such
      that

      (1) FQ) — fl < 5,
      (2) fe +h) = fale + A)l <5.

      Moreover, since f, 1s continuous, for sufficiently small h we have

      It will follow from (1), (2), and (3) that | f(x) — f(x +h)| < e. In order to obtain (3),
      - |-
      However, we must restrict the size of |h| in a way that cannot be predicted until n
      has already been chosen; it is therefore quite essential that there be some fixed n
      which makes (2) true, no matter how small |h| may be—1t is precisely at this point
      that uniform convergence enters the proof.

      Suppose that { f,} is a sequence of functions which are continuous on [a, b], and
      that { f,} converges uniformly on [a, b] to f. Then f is also continuous on [a, b].

      For each x in [a,b] we must prove that f 1s continuous at x. We will deal only
      with x in (a, b); the cases x = a and x = b require the usual simple modifications.

      FIGURE 8

      After the two noteworthy successes provided by Theorem 1 and Theorem 2,
      the situation for differentiability turns out to be very disappointing. If each f, 1s
      differentiable, and if {f,} converges uniformly to f, it is still not necessarily true
      that f is differentiable. For example, Figure 8 shows that there is a sequence of
      differentiable functions { f,} which converges uniformly to the function f(x) = |x|.

      THEOREM 3

      If {f,} is a sequence of differentiable functions on [a, b], and if {f,} converges
      uniformly to f on [a, b], then it is not necessarily true that f is differentiable on
      [a, b].
      - |-
      24. Uniform Convergence and Power Series 505

      Even if f is differentiable, it may not be true that
      f(x) = lim fn(x);

      this is not at all surprising if we reflect that a smooth function can be approximated
      by very rapidly oscillating functions. For example (Figure 9), if

      fn(x) = ~ sin(nπx),

      then {f,} converges uniformly to the function f(x) = 0, but
      fn'(x) =n cos(nπx),

      and lim ncos(nπx) does not always exist (for example, it does not exist if x = 0).
      n→ ∞

      Figure 9

      Despite such examples, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus practically guar-
      antees that some sort of theorem about derivatives will be a consequence of Theo-
      rem 1; the crucial hypothesis is that {f,} converges uniformly (to some continuous
      function).

      Suppose that {f,} is a sequence of functions which are differentiable on [a, b],
      with integrable derivatives f,', and that {f,} converges (pointwise) to f. Suppose,
      moreover, that {f'} converges uniformly on [a, b] to some continuous function g.

      Then f is differentiable and

      f(x) = f(a) + lim fn'(x).
      Applying Theorem 1 to the interval [a, x], we see that for each x we have

      x
      f(x) - f(a) = lim fn'(t) dt.
      a n→ ∞

      Therefore,

      f(x) - f(a) = g(x) - g(a).

      Since g is continuous, it follows that f'(x) = g(x) = lim fn'(x) for all x in the
      interval [a, b]. 

      Now that the basic facts about uniform limits have been established, it is clear
      how to treat functions defined as infinite sums,

      This equation means that
      f(x) = lim [f1(x) + f2(x) + ... + fn(x)].

      our previous theorems apply when the new sequence

      {f1, f2, ...} 
      converges uniformly.

      converges only for —1 < x < 1. It is even possible to produce a power series which
      converges only for x = 0. For example, the power series

      $$
      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} n! x^n
      $$

      does not converge for $x \ne 0$; indeed, the ratios

      $$
      \frac{(n+1)! x^{n+1}}{n! x^n} = (n+1)x
      $$

      are unbounded for any $x \ne 0$. If a power series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$ does converge for
      some $x_0 \ne 0$, however, then a great deal can be said about the series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$ for
      $|x| < |x_0|$.
      Suppose that the series
      $$
      f (x_0) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x_0^n
      $$

      converges, and let $a$ be any number with $0 < a < |x_0|$. Then on $[-a, a]$ the series

      $$
      f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n
      $$

      converges uniformly (and absolutely). Moreover, the same is true for the series

      $$
      g(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n x^n
      $$

      Finally, $f$ is differentiable and

      $$
      f'(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n n x^{n-1}
      $$

      for all $x$ with $|x| < |x_0|$.

      **Proof**: Since $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$ converges, the terms $a_n x_0^n$ approach 0. Hence they are surely

      bounded: there is some number $M$ such that

      $$
      |a_n x_0^n| = |a_n| \cdot |x_0|^n < M \text{ for all } n.
      $$

      Now if $x$ is in $[-a, a]$, then $|x| < |a|$, so

      $$
      |a_n x^n| = |a_n| \cdot |x|^n < |a_n| \cdot |a|^n
      $$

      (this is the clever step)

      $$
      = |a_n| \cdot \left( \frac{|x|}{|x_0|} \right)^n |x_0|^n
      $$

      Since $|a/x_0| < 1$, so the (geometric) series

      $$
      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} M \left( \frac{|x|}{|x_0|} \right)^n
      $$

      converges. Choosing $M = |a/x_0|^n$ as the number $M$, in the Weierstrass M-test, it
      $$
      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} |a_n x^n| < \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} M \left( \frac{|x|}{|x_0|} \right)^n
      $$

      which converges. Therefore, the series $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n$ converges uniformly on $[-a, a]$.

      \sum_{n=0}^\infty 3 b,x"

      does converge for some $ x \neq 0 $. This is left as an exercise (Problem 18).  
      For derivatives, Theorem 6 gives us all the information we need. In particular,  

      when we apply Theorem 6 to the infinite series  
      $$
      \sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots,  
      $$  
      $$
      \cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots,  
      $$  
      $$
      e^x = 1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \cdots,  
      $$  
      we get precisely the results which are expected. Each of these converges for any $ x_0 $,  
      hence the conclusions of Theorem 6 apply for any $ x $:  

      $$
      \sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \cdots,  
      $$  
      $$
      \cos(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \cdots,  
      $$  
      $$
      e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \cdots.  
      $$  

      For the functions $ \arctan x $ and $ f(x) = \log(1 + x) $, the situation is only slightly more  
      complicated. Since the series  
      $$
      \arctan x = x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{5} - \cdots,  
      $$  
      converges for $ |x| < 1 $, and  
      $$
      \arctan'(x) = 1 - x^2 + x^4 - \cdots,  
      $$  
      In this case, the series happens to converge for $ x = -1 $ also. However, the formula  
      for the derivative is not correct for $ x = 1 $ or $ x = -1 $; indeed the series  
      $$
      1 - x^2 + x^4 - \cdots,  
      $$  
      diverges for $ x = 1 $ and $ x = -1 $. Notice that this does not contradict Theorem 6,  
      which proves that the derivative is given by the expected formula only for $ |x| < |x_0| $.

      converges for $ x = 1 $, it also converges for $ |x| < 1 $, and

      \frac{1}{1+x} = \log'(1+x) = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \cdots \text{ for } |x| < 1.
      $$

      In this case, the original series does not converge for $ x = -1 $; moreover, the
      differentiated series does not converge for $ x = 1 $.

      All the considerations which apply to a power series will automatically apply to
      its derivative, at the points where the derivative is represented by a power series.

      If

      $$
      f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n
      $$

      converges for all $ x $ in some interval $ (-R, R) $, then Theorem 6 implies that

      $$
      f'(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n a_n x^{n-1}
      $$

      for all $ x $ in $ (-R, R) $. Applying Theorem 6 once again we find that

      $$
      f''(x) = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} n(n-1) a_n x^{n-2},
      $$

      and proceeding by induction we find that

      $$
      f^{(k)}(x) = \sum_{n=k}^{\infty} n(n-1)(n-2) \cdots (n-k+1) a_n x^{n-k}.
      $$

      Thus, a function defined by a power series which converges in some interval
      $ (-R, R) $ is automatically infinitely differentiable in that interval. Moreover, the
      previous equation implies that

      $$
      f^{(k)}(0) = k! a_k,
      $$

      so that

      $$
      a_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}.
      $$

      In other words, a convergent power series centered at $ 0 $ is always the Taylor series at $ 0 $ of the
      function which it defines.

      On this happy note we could easily end our study of power series and Taylor
      series. A careful assessment of our situation will reveal some unexplained facts, however.
      - |-
      The ‘Taylor series of sin, cos, and exp are as satisfactory as we could desire;
      they converge for all x, and can be differentiated term-by-term for all x. The
      Taylor series of the function f(x) = log(1 + x) is slightly less pleasing, because it
      converges only for −1 < x < 1, but this deficiency is a necessary consequence of
      the basic nature of power series. If the Taylor series for f converges for any xo
      with |xo| > 1, then it would converge on the interval (−|xo|, |xo|), and on this
      interval the function which it defines would be differentiable, and thus continuous.
      But this is impossible, since it is unbounded on the interval (−1, 1), where it equals
      log(1 + x).

      The Taylor series for arctan is more difficult to comprehend—there seems to
      be no possible excuse for the refusal of this series to converge when |x| > 1. This
      mysterious behavior is exemplified even more strikingly by the function f(x) =
      1/(1 + x²), an infinitely differentiable function which is the next best thing to a
      polynomial function. The Taylor series of f is given by

      f(x) = 1 − x² + x⁴ − x⁶ + ...

      If |x| ≥ 1 the Taylor series does not converge at all. Why? What unseen obstacle
      prevents the Taylor series from extending past |1| and −1? Asking this sort of
      question is always dangerous, since we may have to settle for an unsympathetic
      answer: it happens because it happens—that's the way things are! In this case
      there does happen to be an explanation, but this explanation is impossible to give
      at the present time; although the question is about real numbers, it can be answered
      intelligently only when placed in a broader context. It will therefore be necessary
      to devote two chapters to quite new material before completing our discussion of
      Taylor series in Chapter 27.

      Suppose that $ \sum a_n $ converges. We know that the series $ f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n $  
      must converge uniformly on $[-a, a]$ for $ 0 < a < 1 $, but it may not converge  
      uniformly on $[-1, 1]$; in fact, it may not even converge at the point $-1$  
      (for example, if $ f(x) = \log(1 + x) $). However, a beautiful theorem of Abel  
      shows that the series does converge uniformly on $[0, 1]$. Consequently, $ f $ is  
      continuous on $[0, 1]$ and, in particular, $ \sum a_n = \lim_{x \to 1^-} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n $. Prove Abel's  
      Theorem by noticing that if $ |a_0 + \cdots + a_n| < \epsilon $, then  
      $ |a_0 x^0 + \cdots + a_n x^n| < \epsilon $,

      A sequence $ \{a_n\} $ is called Abel summable if $ \lim_{x \to 1^-} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n $ exists; Prob-

      COMPLEX NUMBERS

      With the exception of the last few paragraphs of the previous chapter, this book
      has presented unremitting propaganda for the real numbers. Nevertheless, the
      real numbers do have a great deficiency—not every polynomial function has a
      root. The simplest and most notable example is the fact that no number x can
      satisfy x² + 1 = 0. This deficiency is so severe that long ago mathematicians
      felt the need to "invent" a number i with the property that i² + 1 = 0. For a
      long time the status of the "number" i was quite mysterious: since there is no
      number x satisfying x² + 1 = 0, it is nonsensical to say "let i be the number
      satisfying i² + 1 = 0." Nevertheless, admission of the "imaginary" number i to
      the family of numbers seemed to simplify greatly many algebraic computations,
      especially when "complex numbers" a + bi (for a and b in R) were allowed, and
      all the laws of arithmetical computation enumerated in Chapter 1 were assumed
      to be valid. For example, every quadratic equation

      ax² + bx + c = 0 (a ≠ 0)

      can be solved formally to give

      - b + √(b² - 4ac)   - b - √(b² - 4ac)
      x =        , x =          .
      2a           2a

      If b² - 4ac > 0, these formulas give correct solutions; when complex numbers are
      allowed the formulas seem to make sense in all cases. For example, the equation

      x² + x + 1 = 0
      has no real root, since
      x² + x + 1 = (x + ½)² + ¾ > 0, for all x.

      It is even possible to "solve" quadratic equations whose coefficients are themselves
      complex numbers. For example, the equation

      x-+x+1+i=0

      where the symbol ¥ —3 — 4i means a complex number a + Bi whose square is
      —3—4i. In order to have

      (a + Bi)? =a' — B* + 2afi = —3 —4i
      we need

      a? _ Bo — 3,

      and

      p= -2 p=2.

      Thus the two "square roots" of —3 — 4i are 1 — 2i and —1 4+ 27. There is no

      reasonable way to decide which one of these should be called V —3 — 4i, and which

      For cubic equations complex numbers are equally useful. Every cubic equation
      axe+bx*+ex+d=0 (a0)

      with real coefficients a, b, c, and d, has, as we know, a real root a, and if we divide
      ax? + bx*+cx +d by x —a we obtain a second-degree polynomial whose roots are
      the other roots of ax*?+bx*+cx+d = 0; the roots of this second-degree polynomial

      may be complex numbers. Thus a cubic equation will have either three real roots
      or one real root and 2 complex roots. The existence of the real root is guaranteed
      by our theorem that every odd degree equation has a real root, but it is not really
      necessary to appeal to this theorem (which 1s of no use at all if the coefficients
      are complex); in the case of a cubic equation we can, with sufficient cleverness,
      actually find a formula for all the roots. The following derivation is presented not
      only as an interesting illustration of the ingenuity of early mathematicians, but as
      further evidence for the importance of complex numbers (whatever they may be).

      It turns out that only 3 different values for x will be obtained! An even more

      The fact that even one of these real roots is obtained from an expression which
      depends on complex numbers is impressive enough to suggest that the use of
      complex numbers cannot be entirely nonsense. As a matter of fact, the formulas
      for the solutions of the quadratic and cubic equations can be interpreted entirely
      in terms of real numbers.

      Suppose we agree, for the moment, to write all complex numbers as a + bi,
      writing the real number a as a + Oi and the number 7 as 0+ li. The laws of
      ordinary arithmetic and the relation i? = —1 show that

      (a+bi)+(c4+di)=(at+c)+(b4+d)i
      (a+ bi)-(c+di) = (ac — bd) + (ad + be)i.

      It is not very hard to check this assertion about real numbers without writing
      down a single "7," but the complications of the statement itself should convince
      you that equations about complex numbers are worthwhile as abbreviations for
      pairs of equations about real numbers. (If you are still not convinced, try para-
      phrasing the solution of the cubic equation.) If we really intend to use complex
      numbers consistently, however, it is going to be necessary to present some reason-

      able definition.

      then 4

      One possibility has been implicit in this whole discussion. All mathematical
      properties of a complex number a + bi are determined completely by the real
      numbers a and b; any mathematical object with this same property may reasonably
      be used to define a complex number. The obvious candidate is the ordered pair
      (a,b) of real numbers; we shall accordingly define a complex number to be a pair
      of real numbers, and likewise define what addition and multiplication of complex
      numbers is to mean.

      A complex number is an ordered pair of real numbers; if z = (a, b) is a com-
      plex number, then a 1s called the real part of z, and b is called the umaginary
      part of z. The set of all complex numbers is denoted by C. If (a, b) and (c, d)

      are two complex numbers we define
      - |-
      (a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d)
      (a,b) - (c,d) = (a-c, b-d)

      (The + and - appearing on the left side are new symbols being defined, while the
      + and - appearing on the right side are the familiar addition and multiplication

      for real numbers.)

      When complex numbers were first introduced, it was understood that real num-
      bers were, in particular, complex numbers; if our definition is taken seriously this
      is not true— a real number is not a pair of real numbers, after all. This difficulty
      532 Infinite Sequences and Infinite Series

      DEFINITION

      is only a minor annoyance, however. Notice that

      (a,0) + (b,0) = (a+ b, 0+0) = (a +b,0),
      (a,0)-(b,0) = (a-b, 0-0,a-0 + 0-b) = (a-b,0);

      this shows that the complex numbers of the form (a, 0) behave precisely the same
      with respect to addition and multiplication of complex numbers as real numbers
      do with their own addition and multiplication. For this reason we will adopt the
      convention that (a, 0) will be denoted simply by a. The familiar a + bi notation
      for complex numbers can now be recovered if one more definition is made.

      1 = (0, 1).

      Notice that i² = (0, 1) - (0,1) = (-1,0) = -1 (the last equality sign depends

      on our convention). Moreover

      (a,b) = (a, 0) + (0, b)
      = (a, 0) + (0, 0) - (0, 1)
      = a + bi.
      - |-
      You may feel that our definition was merely an elaborate device for defining complex numbers as "expressions of the form a + bi." ‘That is essentially correct; it is a firmly established prejudice of modern mathematics that new objects must be defined as something specific, not as "expressions." Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that mathematicians were sincerely worried about using complex numbers until the modern definition was proposed. Moreover, the precise definition emphasizes one important point. Our aim in introducing complex numbers was to avoid the necessity of paraphrasing statements about complex numbers in terms of their real and imaginary parts. ‘This means that we wish to work with complex numbers in the same way that we worked with rational or real numbers. For example, the solution of the cubic equation required writing x = w — p/3w, so we want to know that 1/w makes sense. Moreover, w> was found by solving a quadratic equation, which requires numerous other algebraic manipulations. In short, we are likely to use, at some time or other, any manipulations performed on real numbers. We certainly do not want to stop each time and justify every step. Fortunately this is not necessary. Since all algebraic manipulations performed on real numbers can be justified by the properties listed in Chapter 1, it is only necessary to check that these properties are also true for complex numbers. In most cases this is quite easy, and these facts will not be listed as formal theorems. For example, the proof of P1,

      [(a,b) + (c, d)| + (e, f) = (a,b) + [(c, da) + (e, f)]

      requires only the application of the definition of addition for complex numbers. The left side becomes

      (la+c|]t+e,[b+d]+ f),
      and the right side becomes
      (a+ [c+e],b+[d+ f]);
      - |-
      These two are equal because P1 is true for real numbers. It's a good idea to check P2—P6 and P8 and P9. Notice that the complex numbers playing the role of 0 and | in P2 and P6 are (0, 0) and (1, 0), respectively. It is not hard to figure out what —(a, b) is, but the multiplicative inverse for (a, b) required in P7 is a little trickier: if (a,b) ≠ (0, 0), then a* + b* ≠ 0 and

      a —b
      ,b ° ' — 1,0).

      This fact could have been guessed in two ways. 'To find (x, y) with

      it is only necessary to solve the equations

      ax — by = 1,
      bx + ay = 0.
      The solutions are x = a/(a* + b), y = —b/(a* + b'). It is also possible to reason
      that if 1/(a@ + bi) means anything, then it should be true that
      l l a— bi a—bi

      a+bi ~~ atbi a—bi qt 4 2'

      Once the existence of inverses has actually been proved (after guessing the inverse
      by some method), it follows that this manipulation is really valid; it is the easiest one
      to remember when the inverse of a complex number is actually being sought—1it
      was precisely this trick which we used to evaluate

      ~ 3649 -
      - |-
      Unlike P1—P9, the rules P10—P12 do not have analogues: it is easy to prove that
      there is no set P of complex numbers such that P10—P12 are satisfied for all complex
      numbers. In fact, if there were, then P would have to contain 1 (since 1 = 1*) and
      also -1 (since -1 = i"), and this would contradict P10. The absence of P10—P12
      will not have disastrous consequences, but it does mean that we cannot define
      z < w for complex z and w. Also, you may remember that for the real numbers,
      P10—P12 were used to prove that 1+ 1 ≠ 0. Fortunately, the corresponding fact
      for complex numbers can be reduced to this one: clearly (1,0) + (1,0) = (0, 0).

      Although we will usually write complex numbers in the form a + bi, it is worth
      remembering that the set of all complex numbers C is just the collection of all
      pairs of real numbers. Long ago this collection was identified with the plane, and
      for this reason the plane is often called the "complex plane." The horizontal axis,
      which consists of all points (a, 0) for a in R, is often called the real axis, and the
      vertical axis is called the imaginary axis. Two important definitions are also related
      to this geometric picture.

      If z = x + iy is a complex number (with x and y real), then the conjugate $\overline{z}$ of z is defined as

      $$
      \overline{z} = x - iy,
      $$

      and the absolute value or modulus $|z|$ of z is defined as

      $$
      |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
      $$

      (Notice that $x^2 + y^2 > 0$, so that $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ is defined unambiguously; it denotes
      the nonnegative real square root of $x^2 + y^2$.)
      - |-
      Geometrically, z is simply the reflection of z in the real axis, while |z| is the distance from z to (0,0) (Figure 1). Notice that the absolute value notation for complex numbers is consistent with that for real numbers. The distance between two complex numbers z and w can be defined quite easily as |z - w|. The following theorem lists all the important properties of conjugates and absolute values.

      Let z and w be complex numbers. Then

      $$
      \overline{\overline{z}} = z \text{ if and only if } z \text{ is real (i.e., is of the form } a + 0i, \text{ for some real number } a).
      $$

      Assertions (1) and (2) are obvious. Equations (3) and (5) may be checked by straightforward calculations and (4) and (6) may then be proved by a trick:

      $$
      z + (-z) = z - z, \text{ so } -z = -\overline{z}.
      $$

      $$
      |z - z| = 2 \text{ Re}(z), \text{ so } |z| = \text{Re}(z).
      $$

      Equations (7) and (8) may also be proved by a straightforward calculation. The only difficult part of the theorem is (9). This inequality has, in fact, already occurred (Problem 4-9), but the proof will be repeated here, using slightly different terminology.

      It is clear that equality holds in (9) if z = 0 or w = 0. It is also easy to see that (9) is true if z = Aw for any real number A (consider separately the cases A > 0 and A < 0). Suppose, on the other hand, that z ≠ Aw for any real number A, and that w ≠ 0. Then, for all real numbers A,

      $$
      |z - Aw|^2 = (z - Aw)(\overline{z} - \overline{Aw})
      = (z - Aw)\overline{(z - Aw)}
      = |z|^2 + |Aw|^2 - A(w\overline{z} + \overline{w}z).
      $$

      Notice that wz + zw is real, since
      - |-
      w2t7w=w7t+7w=wr7t+Z7w = w7z+ Zw.

      ‘Thus the right side of (*) 1s a quadratic equation in A with real coefficients and no
      real solutions; its discriminant must therefore be negative. Thus

      (wz + zw)? —4|w/? - |z\? < 0;
      it follows, since wz + zw and |w| - |z| are real numbers, and |w] - |z| > 0, that
      (wz + zw) < 2|w|- |zI.
      From this inequality it follows that

      z+ wl? =(zt+tw)-(2+0)
      = Fale + \w|? + (wz + zw)
      < |z|? + |wl* + 2|w] - |zI
      = (|z| + |w)',

      which implies that
      Iz + wl <|zi+lwl. E

      The operations of addition and multiplication of complex numbers both have
      important geometric interpretations. Ihe picture for addition is very simple (Fig-
      ure 2). Two complex numbers z = (a,b) and w = (c,d) determine a paral-
      lelogram having for two of its sides the line segment from (0,0) to z, and the
      line segment from (0, 0) to w; the vertex opposite (0,0) is z + w (a proof of this
      geometric fact is left to you [compare Appendix | to Chapter 4]).

      The interpretation of multiplication is more involved. If z = O or w = OQ,
      then z-w = O(a one-line computational proof can be given, but even this is
      unnecessary—the assertion has already been shown to follow from P1—P9), so we
      may restrict our attention to nonzero complex numbers. We begin by putting every
      nonzero complex number into a special form (compare Appendix 3 to Chapter 4).

      For any complex number z 4 O we can write
      <

      z= [2] 7:
      Fd

      in this expression, |z| is a positive real number, while

      - |-
      So that z/|z| is a complex number of absolute value 1. Now any complex number  
      a = x + iy with 1 = ja] = x*+ y* can be written in the form  

      length a = (cos@,sin@) = cos@ + i sin@  

      for some number @. Thus every nonzero complex number z can be written  

      angle of @ radians z = r(cosé + i sin@)  

      for some r > 0 and some number 6. The number r is unique (it equals |z|), but 4  
      is not unique; if 99 is one possibility, then the others are 69 + 2km for k in Z—any  
      FIGURE 3 one of these numbers is called an argument of z. Figure 3 shows z in terms of r  
      and @. (To find an argument 6 for z = x + /y we may note that the equation  

      x + iy = z = |z| (cosé + i sin@)  
      means that  

      x = |z| cos@,  
      y = |z| sin@.  

      So, for example, if x > 0 we can take 6 = arctan y/x; if x = O, we can take  
      0 = 7/2 when y > 0 and 6 = 3π/2 when y < 0.)  
      Now the product of two nonzero complex numbers  

      z = r(cos@ + i sin8@),  
      w = s(cos¢? + i sinγ),  

      is  
      z · w = rs (cos@ + i sin@)(cos¢@ + i sinγ)  

      = rs [(cos@ cos @ — sin @ sin γ) + i (sin @ cos γ + cos @ sin γ)]  
      = rs {cos(@ + γ) + i sin(@ + γ)}.  

      Thus, the absolute value of a product is the product of the absolute values of the  
      factors, while the sum of any argument for each of the factors will be an argument  
      for the product. For a nonzero complex number  

      z = r(cosé + i sin@)  

      it is now an easy matter to prove by induction the following very important formula

      This formula describes z" so explicitly that it is easy to decide just when z" = w:
      THEOREM 2 Every nonzero complex number has exactly n complex nth roots.

      More precisely, for any complex number w # OQ, and any natural number n,
      there are precisely n different complex numbers z satisfying 2" = w.

      for s = |w| and some number ¢. Then a complex number
      z=r(cosé+isin@)
      satisfies 7" = w if and only if
      r"(cosn@ +isinn@) = s(cos¢ +ising),
      which happens if and only if

      r"= S$,
      cosn@ +isinn@ =cos@+isin®g.

      From the first equation it follows that

      nm

      r= //S,

      where 4/s denotes the positive real nth root of s. From the second equation it
      follows that for some integer k we have
      2kr
      60=h = ? + —.
      n n

      Conversely, if we choose r = </s and 6 = & for some k, then the number z =
      r(cos@ +isin@) will satisfy z" = w. ‘To determine the number of nth roots of w,
      it is therefore only necessary to determine which such z are distinct. Now any
      integer k can be written

      k=ngt+k'
      for some integer g, and some integer k' between 0 and n — 1. Then
      cos& + isin & = cos Oy +7 sin Oy.
      This shows that every z satisfying z" = w can be written
      z= *V/s(cos@ +isin®) k=0,...,n—1.

      Moreover, it is easy to see that these numbers are all different, since any two & for
      k =0,...,n —1 differ by less than 27. J

      In the course of proving Theorem 2, we have actually developed a method for
      finding the nth roots of a complex number. For example, to find the cube roots
      of i (Figure 4) note that |i| = 1 and that w/2 1s an argument for i. The cube roots
      of i are therefore

      re^{i\theta}

      Since

      cos \frac{\pi}{3} = - sin \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2},
      cos \frac{\pi}{2} = 0, sin \frac{\pi}{2} = 1,
      the cube roots of i are
      \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{i}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{i}{2}, -1.

      In general, we cannot expect to obtain such simple results. For example, to find

      the cube roots of 2+ i11i, note that |2 + 11i| = \sqrt{2^2 + 11^2} = \sqrt{125} and that

      arctan(11/2) is an argument for 2+ 11i. One of the cube roots of 2+ 11i is therefore

      \sqrt[3]{125} \left( \cos \frac{1}{3} \arctan\left(\frac{11}{2}\right) + i \sin \frac{1}{3} \arctan\left(\frac{11}{2}\right) \right)

      = 5 \left( \cos \frac{1}{3} \arctan\left(\frac{11}{2}\right) + i \sin \frac{1}{3} \arctan\left(\frac{11}{2}\right) \right)

      Previously we noted that 2 + i7 is also a cube root of 2+ 11i. Since |2 + i7| =

      \sqrt{2^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{5}, and since arctan(7/2) is an argument of 2 + i7, we can write this
      cube root as

      2+i = \sqrt{5} \left( \cos \arctan\left(\frac{7}{2}\right) + i \sin \arctan\left(\frac{7}{2}\right) \right):
      These two cube roots are actually the same number, because

      \arctan\left(\frac{11}{2}\right) = \arctan\left(\frac{7}{2}\right)

      (you can check this by using the formula in Problem 15-9), but this is hardly the
      sort of thing one might notice!

      The fact that every complex number has an nth root for all n is just a special
      case of a very important theorem. The number i was originally introduced in
      order to provide a solution for the equation x^2 + 1 = 0. The Fundamental Theorem
      of Algebra states the remarkable fact that this one addition automatically provides
      solutions for all other polynomial equations: every equation

      2744, 1,27 1 +.---+a9 =0 aj,...,@a,-; NG

      has a complex root!

      In the next chapter we shall give an almost complete proof of the Fundamental
      Theorem of Algebra; the slight gap left in the text can be filled in as an exercise
      (Problem 26-5). The proof of the theorem will rely on several new concepts which
      come up quite naturally in a more thorough investigation of complex numbers.

      COMPLEX FUNCTIONS
      - |-
      You will probably not be surprised to learn that a deeper investigation of complex numbers depends on the notion of functions. Until now a function was (intuitively) a rule which assigned real numbers to certain other real numbers. But there is no reason why this concept should not be extended; we might just as well consider a rule which assigns complex numbers to certain other complex numbers. A rigorous definition presents no problems (we will not even accord it the full honors of a formal definition): a function is a collection of pairs of complex numbers which does not contain two distinct pairs with the same first element. Since we consider real numbers to be certain complex numbers, the old definition is really a special case of the new one. Nevertheless, we will sometimes resort to special terminology in order to clarify the context in which a function is being considered. A function f is called real-valued if f(z) is a real number for all z in the domain of f, and complex-valued to emphasize that it is not necessarily real-valued. Similarly, we will usually state explicitly that a function f is defined on [a subset of] R in those cases where the domain of f is [a subset of] R; in other cases we sometimes mention that f is defined on [a subset of ] C to emphasize that f(z) is defined for complex z as well as real z.

      Among the multitude of functions defined on C, certain ones are particularly important. Foremost among these are the functions of the form

      f(z) = a_nz^n + a_{n-1}z^{n-1} + \dots + a_1z + a_0,

      where a_0, ..., a_n are complex numbers. These functions are called, as in the real case, polynomial functions; they include the function f(z) = z (the "identity function") and functions of the form f(z) = a for some complex number a ("constant functions"). Another important generalization of a familiar function is the "absolute value function" f(z) = |z| for all z in C.

      Two functions of particular importance for complex numbers are Re (the "real part function") and Im (the "imaginary part function"), defined by

      Re(x + iy) = x,

      Im(x + iy) = y, for x and y real.
      - |-
      The "conjugate function" is defined by  
      f(z) = \overline{z} = \text{Re}(z) - i \text{Im}(z).  

      Familiar real-valued functions defined on $\mathbb{R}$ may be combined in many ways to  
      produce new complex-valued functions defined on $G$—an example is the function  

      $$f(x + iy) = e^{x} \sin(x - y) + i x^2 \cos y.$$  
      541  
      $$
      \text{Figure 1: } f(z)
      $$

      542 Infinite Sequences and Infinite Series  

      The formula for this particular function illustrates a decomposition which is always  
      possible. Any complex-valued function $f$ can be written in the form  

      $$f(z) = u(z) + i v(z)$$  

      for some real-valued functions $u$ and $v$—simply define $u(z)$ as the real part of $f(z)$,  
      and $v(z)$ as the imaginary part. This decomposition is often very useful, but not  
      always; for example, it would be inconvenient to describe a polynomial function  
      in this way.  

      One other function will play an important role in this chapter. Recall that an  
      argument of a nonzero complex number $z$ is a (real) number $\theta$ such that  

      $$z = |z|(\cos\theta + i \sin\theta).$$

      There are infinitely many arguments for $z$, but just one which satisfies $0 < \theta < 2\pi$. If we call this unique argument $\theta(z)$, then $\theta$ is a (real-valued) function (the  
      "argument function") on $\{z \in G: z \neq 0\}$.  

      "Graphs" of complex-valued functions defined on $G$, since they lie in 4-dimensional space, are presumably not very useful for visualization. The alternative  
      picture of a function mentioned in Chapter 4 can be used instead: we draw two copies of $\mathbb{C}$, and arrows from $z$ in one copy, to $f(z)$ in the other (Figure 1).  

      $$
      \begin{array}{c}
      \text{Y} \\
      e \\
      ww \\
      on o \\
      ~
      \end{array}
      $$

      FIGURE 1: $f(z)$  

      The most common pictorial representation of a complex-valued function is pro-  
      duced by labeling a point in the plane with the value $f(z)$, instead of with $z$ (which  
      can be estimated from the position of the point in the picture). Figure 2 shows this  
      sort of picture for several different functions. Certain features of the function are  
      illustrated very clearly by such a "graph." For example, the absolute value function  
      is constant on concentric circles around $0$, the functions $\text{Re}$ and $\text{Im}$ are constant
      - |-
      on the vertical and horizontal lines, respectively, and the function f(z) = z² wraps  
      the circle of radius r twice around the circle of radius r.  

      Despite the problems involved in visualizing complex-valued functions in general, it is still possible to define analogues of important properties previously defined for real-valued functions on R, and in some cases these properties may be easier to visualize in the complex case. For example, the notion of limit can be defined as follows:  

      lim f(z) = L means that for every (real) number ε > 0 there is a (real) number  
      δ > 0 such that, for all z, if 0 < |z − a| < δ, then |f(z) − L| < ε.

      Although the definition reads precisely as before, the interpretation is slightly different. Since |z — w| is the distance between the complex numbers z and w, the equation lim f(z) = / means that the values of f(z) can be made to lie inside
      za

      any given circle around /, provided that z is restricted to lie inside a sufficiently
      small circle around a. ‘This assertion 1s particularly easy to visualize using the "two

      inequality |z + w| < |z| + |w|, and this inequality holds for complex numbers as
      well as for real numbers. These facts already provide quite a few limits, but many
      more can be obtained from the following theorem.

      Since u(z) — a and v(z) — B are both real numbers, their squares are positive; this
      inequality therefore implies that

      [u(z) —a]* <e* and [v(z)— B]* <e',
      which implies that

      lim Re(z) = Re(a),

      lim Im(z) = Im(a).
      A limit like

      "square-root function," that is, a function f such that (f (z))? = z for all z. For real
      numbers the function / had as domain only the nonnegative real numbers. If
      complex numbers are allowed, then every number has two square roots (except 0,
      which has only one). Although this situation may seem better, it is in some ways
      worse; since the square roots of z are complex numbers, there is no clear criterion
      for selecting one root to be f(z), in preference to the other.

      One way to define f is the following. We set f (0) = 0, and for z ≠ 0 we set  
      $$
      f(z) = \overline{z} = \text{Vil } (\cos \theta + i\sin \theta).
      $$

      Clearly $(f(z))^* = z$, but the function f is discontinuous, since $\theta$ is discontinuous.  
      As a matter of fact, it is impossible to find a continuous f such that $(f(z))^* = z$ for  
      all z. In fact, it is even impossible for f(z) to be defined for all z with $|z| = 1$. To  
      prove this by contradiction, we can assume that f(1) = 1 (since we could always  
      replace f by −f). Then we claim that for all $\theta$ with $0 < \theta < 2\pi$ we have  

      $$
      (*) \quad f(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = \cos 5\theta + i\sin 5\theta.
      $$

      The argument for this is left to you (it is a standard type of least upper bound  
      argument). But (*) implies that  

      $$
      \lim_{\theta \to 2\pi} f(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = \cos 5\theta + i\sin 5\theta,
      $$

      which is  
      $$
      f(1) = -1,
      $$

      even though $\cos\theta + i\sin\theta \to 1$ as $\theta \to 2\pi$. Thus, we have our contradic-  
      tion. A similar argument shows that it is impossible to define continuous "nth-root"  
      functions for any $n > 2$.

      For continuous complex functions there are important analogues of certain the-  
      orems which describe the behavior of real-valued functions on closed intervals. A  
      natural analogue of the interval $[a, b]$ is the set of all complex numbers $z = x + iy$  
      with $a < x < b$ and $c < y < d$ (Figure 5). This set is called a closed rectangle,  
      and is denoted by $[a, b] \times [c, d]$.

      If f is a continuous complex-valued function whose domain is $[a,b] \times [c, d]$,  
      then it seems reasonable, and is indeed true, that f is bounded on $[a, b] \times [c, d]$.  
      That is, there is some real number M such that  

      $$
      |f(z)| < M \quad \text{for all } z \in [a, b] \times [c, d].

      It does not make sense to say that f has a maximum and a minimum value on
      [a, b] x [c,d], since there is no notion of order for complex numbers. If f is a
      real-valued function, however, then this assertion does make sense, and is true. In
      particular, if f is any complex-valued continuous function on [a, b] x [c,d], then

      THEOREM 2 (THE FUNDAMENTAL
      THEOREM OF ALGEBRA)

      PROOF

      now give a proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which is really quite
      surprising, since we have not yet said much to distinguish polynomial functions
      from other continuous functions.

      Let ag,...,@,—, be any complex numbers. Then there is a complex number z

      such that

      Our proof is based on the observation that a point Zo with f(z9) = O would clearly
      be a minimum point for | f|. ‘[o prove the theorem we will first show that | f| does
      indeed have a smallest value on the whole complex plane. ‘The proof wil be almost
      identical to the proof, in Chapter 7, that a polynomial function of even degree
      (with real coefficients) has a smallest value on all of R; both proofs depend on the
      fact that if |z| 1s large, then | f(z)| 1s large.

      We begin by writing, for z ≠ 0,

      Now let [a, b] x [c, d] be a closed rectangle (Figure 6) which contains {z : |z| <

      max(M, «/2|f(0)|)}, and suppose that the minimum of |f| on [a,b] x [e, d] is
      attained at Zo, so that

      (1) |f(zo)l < |f(@I| for z in [a, b] x [e, d].

      It follows, in particular, that | f(zo)| < |f(O)|. Thus

      (2) if |z| > max(M, ¥/2|f(0)|), then | f(z)] = |f(0)| = If @o)I.

      minimum value on the whole complex plane at Zo.

      To complete the proof of the theorem we now show that f(zo) = 0. It is
      convenient to introduce the function g defined by

      g(z) = f(z + Zo).

      Then g is a polynomial function of degree n, whose minimum absolute value
      occurs at 0. We want to show that g(0) = 0.

      Suppose instead that g(0) = a # O. If m is the smallest positive power of z
      which occurs in the expression for g, we can write

      2(z) =a + Bz +eme ort! +-:-: + Cn2",

      where B # 0. Now, according to Theorem 25-2 there is a complex number y

      contradicting the fact that |@| is the minimum of |g| on the whole plane. Hence,
      the original assumption must be incorrect, and g(0) = 0. This implies, finally, that

      Even taking into account our omission of the proofs for the basic facts about
      continuous complex functions, this proof verified a deep fact with surprisingly
      little work. It is only natural to hope that other interesting developments will arise
      if we pursue further the analogues of properties of real functions. ‘The next obvious

      differentiabulity of rational functions however. Many other obvious candidates are
      not differentiable. Suppose, for example, that

      are to come from. If you recall the definitions of sin and exp, you will see that
      there is no hope at all of generalizing these definitions to complex numbers. At
      the moment the outlook is bleak, but all our problems will soon be solved.

      PROBLEMS

      1. (a) For any real number y, define a(x) = x + iy (so that f is a complex-
      valued function defined on R). Show that f is continuous. (This follows
      immediately from a theorem in this chapter.) Show similarly that g(y) =
      x + iy is continuous.

      (b) Let f be a continuous function defined on C. For fixed y, let g(x) =
      f(x + iy). Show that g is a continuous function (defined on R). Show
      similarly that h(y) = f(x + iy) is continuous. Hint: Use part (a).

      2. (a) Suppose that f is a continuous real-valued function defined on a closed
      rectangle [a, b] x [c, d]. Prove that if f takes on the values f(z) and f(w)
      for z and w in [a, b] x [c, d], then f also takes all values between f(z)
      and f(w). Hint: Consider g(t) = f(tz + (1 - t)w) for t in [0, 1].

      Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:

      ---

      **(b)** If $ f $ is a continuous complex-valued function defined on $[a, b] \times [c, d]$, the assertion in part (a) no longer makes any sense, since we cannot talk of complex numbers between $ f(z) $ and $ f(w) $. We might conjecture that $ f $ takes on all values on the line segment between $ f(z) $ and $ f(w) $, but even this is false. Find an example which shows this.

      3. (a) Prove that if $ a_0, \ldots, a_{n-1} $ are any complex numbers, then there are complex numbers $ z_1, \ldots, z_n $ (not necessarily distinct) such that

      $$
      z^n + a_{n-1} z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 = \prod_{i=1}^{n} (z - z_i).
      $$

      (b) Prove that if $ a_0, \ldots, a_{n-1} $ are real, then $ z^n + a_{n-1} z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 $ can be written as a product of linear factors $ z - a_i $ and quadratic factors $ z^2 + az + b $ all of whose coefficients are real. (Use Problem 25-7.)

      4. In this problem we will consider only polynomials with real coefficients. Such a polynomial is called a sum of squares if it can be written as $ h_1^2 + \cdots + h_k^2 $ for polynomials $ h_i $ with real coefficients.

      (a) Prove that if $ f $ is a sum of squares, then $ f(x) > 0 $ for all $ x $.

      (b) Prove that if $ f $ and $ g $ are sums of squares, then so is $ f - g $.

      (c) Suppose that $ f(x) > 0 $ for all $ x $. Show that $ f $ is a sum of squares. Hint:

      First write $ f(x) = \prod_{i=1}^{k} (x - r_i)^2 g(x) $, where $ g(x) > 0 $ for all $ x $. Then use Problem 3(b).

      5. (a) Let A be a set of complex numbers. A number Zz is called, as in the
      real case, a limit point of the set A if for every (real) ε > 0, there is
      a point a in A with |z − a| < ε but z ≠ a. Prove the two-dimensional
      version of the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem: If A is an infinite subset
      of [a,b] × [c,d], then A has a limit point in [a, b] × [c,d]. Hint: First
      divide [a,b] × [c,d] in half by a vertical line as in Figure 7(a). Since A
      is infinite, at least one half contains infinitely many points of A. Divide
      (b) this in half by a horizontal line, as in Figure 7(b). Continue in this way,

      FIGURE 1 alternately dividing by vertical and horizontal lines.

      (The two-dimensional bisection argument outlined in this hint is so standard that the title "Bolzano-Weierstrass" often serves to describe the
      method of proof, in addition to the theorem itself. See, for example,
      H. Petard, "A Contribution to the Mathematical Theory of Big Game
      Hunting," Amer. Math. Monthly, 45 (1938), 446-447.)

      (b) Prove that a continuous (complex-valued) function on [a,b] × [c, d] is
      bounded on [a, b] × [c,d]. (Imitate Problem 22-31.)

      (c) Prove that if f is a real-valued continuous function on [a, b] × [c, d],
      then f takes on a maximum and minimum value on [a, b] × [c,d]. (You
      can use the same trick that works for Theorem 7-3.)

      THEOREM 1

      PROOF

      COMPLEX POWER SERIES

      If you have not already guessed where differentiable complex functions are going
      to come from, the title of this chapter should give the secret away: we intend to
      define functions by means of infinite series. ‘This will necessitate a discussion of
      infinite sequences of complex numbers, and sums of such sequences, but (as was
      the case with limits and continuity) the basic definitions are almost exactly the
      same as for real sequences and series.
      - |-
      An infinite sequence of complex numbers is, formally, a complex-valued func-
      tion whose domain is N; the convenient subscript notation for sequences of real
      numbers will also be used for sequences of complex numbers. A sequence {a_n} of
      complex numbers is most conveniently pictured by labeling the points a_n in the
      plane (Figure 1).

      The sequence shown in Figure 1 converges to 0, "convergence" of complex
      sequences being defined precisely as for real sequences: the sequence {a_n}
      converges to L, in symbols

      lim a_n = L,
      n→∞

      if for every ε > 0 there is a natural number N such that, for all n,
      if n > N, then |a_n − L| < ε.

      This condition means that any circle drawn around L will contain a_n for all sufficiently large n (Figure 2); expressed more colloquially, the sequence is eventually inside any circle drawn around L.

      Convergence of complex sequences is not only defined precisely as for real
      sequences, but can even be reduced to this familiar case.

      Let
      a_n = b_n + i c_n for real b_n and c_n,
      and let
      L = B + i Y for real B and Y.
      Then lim a_n = L if and only if
      lim b_n = B and lim c_n = Y.

      The proof is left as an easy exercise. If there is any doubt as to how to proceed,
      consult the similar Theorem 1 of Chapter 26.

      The sum of a sequence {a_n} is defined, once again, as lim s_n, where

      n→∞
      s_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n.

      This is an immediate consequence of Theorem | applied to the sequence of partial

      In other words, absolute convergence implies convergence. Similar reasoning  
      shows that any rearrangement of an absolutely convergent series has the same  
      sum. These facts can also be proved directly, without using the corresponding the-  
      orems for real numbers, by first establishing an analogue of the Cauchy criterion  
      (see Problem 13).  

      With these preliminaries safely disposed of, we can now consider complex  
      power series, that is, functions of the form  

      OO  
      f (z) = > an(z — a)" = ag + a1 (z — a) + a2(z — a)^2 + ... ;  
      n=0  

      Here the numbers a and an are allowed to be complex, and we are naturally  
      interested in the behavior of f for complex z. As in the real case, we shall usually  
      consider power series centered at 0,  

      OO  
      f(z) = Σ anz^n = a0 + a1z + a2z^2 + ... ;  
      n=0  

      in this case, if f(z0) converges, then f(z) will also converge for |z| < |zo|. The  
      proof of this fact will be similar to the proof of Theorem 24-6, but, for reasons  
      that will soon become clear, we will not use all the paraphernalia of uniform con-  
      vergence and the Weierstrass M-test, even though they have complex analogues. Our next theorem consequently generalizes only a small part of Theorem 24-6.  

      Suppose that  

      CO  
      Σ anz0^n = a0 + a1z0 + a2z0^2 + ...  
      n=0  

      converges for some z0 ≠ 0. Then if |z| < |z0|, the two series  

      Σ anz^n = a0 + a1z + a2z^2 + ...  
      n=0  

      Σ nanz^n = a0 + 2a1z + 3a2z^2 + ...  
      n=1  

      both converge absolutely.  

      PROOF As in the proof of Theorem 24-6, we will need only the fact that the set of numbers  
      an z0^n is bounded: there is a number M such that  
      |an z0^n| ≤ M for all n.

      It seems quite unlikely that the set of points where a power series converges
      could be anything except the set of points inside a circle. If we allow "circles of
      radius 0" (when the power series converges only at 0) and "circles of radius 00"
      (when the power series converges at all points), then this assertion is true (with one
      complication which we will soon mention); the proof requires only Theorem 4 and
      a knack for good organization.

      n = (0  
      and diverges if |z| > R. (Notice that we do not mention what happens  
      when |z| = R.)  

      PROOF Let  
      OO  
      S = {r ∈ ℝ: ∑ a_n r^n converges for some w with |w| = x}  
      n=0  
      Suppose first that S is unbounded. Then for any complex number z, there is  
      OO  
      a number x in S such that |z| < x. By definition of S, this means that ∑ a_n w^n  
      n=0  

      OO  
      converges for some w with |w| = x > |z|. It follows from Theorem 4 that ∑ a_n z^n  
      n=0  
      converges absolutely. Therefore, in this case possibility (2) is true.  

      Now suppose that S is bounded, and let R be the least upper bound of S. If  
      R = 0, then ∑ a_n z^n converges only for z = 0, so possibility (1) is true. Suppose,  
      n=0  

      on the other hand, that R > 0. Then if z is a complex number with |z| < R, there  
      is a number x in S with |z| < x. Once again, this means that ∑ a_n w^n converges  
      n=0  
      for some w with |z| < |w|, so that ∑ a_n z^n converges absolutely. Moreover, if  
      n=0  
      OO  
      |z| > R, then ∑ a_n z^n does not converge, since |z| is not in S.  
      n=0  

      The number R which occurs in case (3) is called the radius of convergence of  
      ∑ a_n z^n. In cases (1) and (2) it is customary to say that the radius of convergence  
      n=0  
      is 0 and ∞, respectively. When 0 < R < ∞, the circle {z : |z| = R} is called  
      the circle of convergence of ∑ a_n z^n. If z is outside the circle, then, of course,

      But our real goal in this chapter is to produce differentiable functions. We
      therefore want to generalize the result proved for real power series in Chapter 24,
      that a function defined by a power series can be differentiated term-by-term in-
      side the circle of convergence. At this point we can no longer imitate the proof of
      Chapter 24, even if we were willing to introduce uniform convergence, because no
      analogue of Theorem 24-3 seems available. Instead we will use a direct argument
      (which could also have been used in Chapter 24). Before beginning the proof,

      we notice that at least there is no problem about the convergence of the series

      We will show that for any ε > 0, each absolute value on the right side can be made  
      < ε/3 by choosing N sufficiently large and A sufficiently small. This will clearly  
      prove the theorem.

      Only the first term in the right side of (*) will present any difficulties. 'To begin  
      with, choose some Zo with |z| < |Zo| < R; henceforth we will consider only h  
      with |z + h| < |zo|. The expression ((z + h)^n — z^n)/h can be written in a more  
      convenient way if we remember that

      x^n — y^n  
      x — y  

      = n—2 n—3..2  
      — xy^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + ... + y^{n-1}

      Applying this to  
      ((z + h)^n — z^n)/h — ((z + h)^n — z^n)/h  

      we obtain  
      ((z + h)^n — z^n)/h = (z + h)^{n-1} + z(z + h)^{n-2} + ... + z^{n-1}

      Since  
      |((z + h)^n — z^n)/h| < n |z + h|^{n-1}  

      we have  
      |((z + h)^n — z^n)/h| < n |zo|^{n-1}  

      But the series Σ n |a_n| |zo|^{n-1} converges, so if N is sufficiently large, then  

      Σ  
      n=1  
      |a_n| |zo|^{n-1} < 3.  

      This means that  
      Σ  
      n=0  
      |a_n (z + h)^n — a_n z^n| < 3,  

      for all h with |z + h| < |zo|.  
      In short, if N is sufficiently large, then  

      Σ  
      n=0  
      |a_n (z + h)^n — a_n z^n| < 5,  

      for all h with |z + h| < |zo|.

      It is easy to deal with the third term on the right side of (*): Since $\sum 3 NAnZ$ converges, it follows that if $N$ is sufficiently large, then

      $$
      \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left| \frac{2}{n} - \frac{nanz}{n} \right| < \epsilon
      $$

      Finally, choosing an $N$ such that (1) and (2) are true, we note that

      $$
      \lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{n=1}^{N} a_n (z - 2)^n = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n (z - 2)^n
      $$

      since the polynomial function $g(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z^n$ is certainly differentiable. Therefore

      $$
      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n (z + h - 2)^n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n (z - 2)^n
      $$

      Theorem 6 has an obvious corollary: a function represented by a power series is infinitely differentiable inside the circle of convergence, and the power series is its Taylor series at 0. It follows, in particular, that $f$ is continuous inside the circle of convergence, since a function differentiable at $z$ is continuous at $z$ (Problem 26-8).

      The continuity of a power series inside its circle of convergence helps explain the behavior of certain Taylor series obtained for real functions, and gives the promised answers to the questions raised at the end of Chapter 24. We have already seen that the Taylor series for the function $f(z) = \frac{1}{1 + z^2}$, namely,

      $$
      1 - z^2 + z^4 - z^6 + \cdots

      gence |. It is no accident that the circle of convergence contains the two points
      i and —i at which f is undefined. If this power series converged in a circle of
      radius greater than 1, then (Figure 5) it would represent a function which was
      continuous in that circle, in particular at i and —i. But this is impossible, since it
      equals 1/(1 + z") inside the unit circle, and 1/(1 + 2*) does not approach a limit
      as ZS approaches / or —i from inside the unit circle.

      The use of complex numbers also sheds some light on the strange behavior of
      the ‘Taylor series for the function

      The interesting fact about this expression 1s that 1t becomes large as y becomes
      small. Thus f will not even be continuous at 0 when defined for complex numbers,
      so it is hardly surprising that it is equal to its Taylor series only for z = 0.

      The method by which we will actually define e* (as well as sin z and cos z) for
      complex z should by now be clear. For real x we know that

      Then sin'(z) = cosz, cos'(z) = —sinz, and exp (z) = exp(z) by Theorem 6.
      Moreover, if we replace z by iz in the series for e*, and make a rearrangement
      of the terms (justified by absolute convergence), something particularly interesting
      happens:

      It is clear from the definitions (1.e., the power series) that

      sin(—z) = — sin Z,
      cos(—z) = cos Z,

      so we also have
      e '* =cosz—iSsiInz.

      The development of complex power series thus places the exponential function at
      the very core of the development of the elementary functions—it reveals a con-
      nection between the trigonometric and exponential functions which was never
      imagined when these functions were first defined, and which could never have
      been discovered without the use of complex numbers. As a by-product of this
      relationship, we obtain a hitherto unsuspected connection between the numbers e
      and m: if in the formula
      e~ =cosz+isinz
      we take z = 7, we obtain the remarkable result

      With these remarks we will bring to a close our investigation of complex func-

      tions. And yet there are still several basic facts about power series which have not
      been mentioned. Thus far, we have seldom considered power series centered at a,

      For power series centered at a there are obvious versions of all the theorems in

      this chapter (the proofs require only trivial modifications): there is a number R

      It is less straightforward to investigate the possibility of representing a function

      at a. If

      has radius of convergence R, and b is a point with |b − a| < R (Figure 6), then it  
      is true that f(z) can also be written as a power series centered at b,  
      $$
      f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b_n (z - b)^n

      (the numbers $b_n$ are necessarily $f^{(n)}(b)/n!$); moreover, this series has radius of

      and g(b) = a, then we would expect that f ◦ g can be written as a power series  
      centered at b. All such facts could be proved now without introducing any basic  
      new ideas, but the proofs would not be as easy as the proofs about sums, products  
      and reciprocals of power series. The possibility of changing a power series centered  
      at a into one centered at b is quite a bit more involved, and the treatment of  
      f ◦ g requires still more skill. Rather than end this section with a tour de force  
      of computations, we will instead give a preview of "complex analysis," one of  
      the most beautiful branches of mathematics, where all these facts are derived as  
      straightforward consequences of some fundamental results.
      - |-
      Power series were introduced in this chapter in order to provide complex functions which are differentiable. Since these functions are actually infinitely differentiable, it is natural to suppose that we have therefore selected only a very special collection of differentiable complex functions. The basic theorems of complex analysis show that this is not at all true:

      If a complex function is defined in some region A of the plane and is differentiable in A, then it is automatically infinitely differentiable in A. Moreover, for each point a in A the Taylor series for f at a will converge to f in any circle contained in A (Figure 7).

      These facts are among the first to be proved in complex analysis. It is impossible to give any idea of the proofs themselves—the methods used are quite different from anything in elementary calculus. If these facts are granted, however, then the facts mentioned before can be proved very easily.

      Suppose, for example, that f and g are functions which can be written as power series. Then, as we have shown, f and g are differentiable—it then follows from easy general theorems that f + g, f - g, 1/g and fg are also differentiable. Appealing to the results from complex analysis, it follows that they can be written as power series.

      We already know how to compute the power series for f + g, f - g and 1/g from those for f and g. It is also easy to guess how one would compute an expression for f ◦ g as a power series in (z — b) when we are given the power series expansions

      $$
      f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n (z - a)^n
      $$
      $$
      g(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} b_k (z - b)^k
      $$
      with a = g(b) = b_0, so that

      $$
      g(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k (z - b)^k
      $$

      First of all, we know how to compute the power series

      $$
      f(g(z) - a) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n (g(z) - a)^n
      $$

      and this power series will begin with (z - b)^1. Consequently, the coefficient of z^n in f(g(z)) can be determined from the coefficients of the power series for f and g.

      As an added incentive to investigate complex analysis further, one more result
      will be mentioned, which les quite near the surface, and which will be found in
      any treatment of the subject.

      For real z the values of sinz always lie between —1 and 1, but for complex z
      this is not at all true. In fact, if z = iy, for y real, then

      If y is large, then sin iy 1s also large in absolute value. This behavior of sin 1s typical
      of functions which are defined and differentiable on the whole complex plane (such
      functions are called entire). A result which comes quite early in complex analysis 1s
      the following:

      Liouville's Theorem: The only bounded entire functions are the constant functions.

      As a simple application of Liouville's Theorem, consider a polynomial function
      f(z) = 2" +ay_1z""| +++» +409,

      where n > I, so that f 1s not a constant. We already know that f(z) 1s large for
      large z, so Liouville's Theorem tells us nothing interesting about f. But consider
      the function |

      fF)

      If f(z) were never 0, then g would be entire; since f(z) becomes large for large z,
      the function g would also be bounded, contradicting Liouville's Theorem. Thus
      f(z) = 0 for some z, and we have proved the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

      The root test can always be used, in theory at least, to find the radius of
      convergence of a power series; in fact, a close analysis of the situation leads
      to a formula for the radius of convergence, known as the "Cauchy-Hadamard
      formula." Suppose first that the set of numbers $ \frac{1}{\sqrt[n]{|a_n|}} $ is bounded.

      (a) Use Problem 23-9 to show that if $ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt[n]{|a_n|}} |z| < 1 $, then $ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z^n $ converges.

      (b) Also show that if $ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt[n]{|a_n|}} |z| > 1 $, then $ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n z^n $ has unbounded terms.

      $ \frac{1}{\lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_n|}} $ (where "1/0" means "oo"). To complete the formula, de-

      fine $ \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_n|} = 00 $ if the set of all $ \frac{1}{\sqrt[n]{|a_n|}} $ is unbounded. Prove that in

      is 0 (which may be considered as "1 / \infty").

      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)} (x)}{n!} (x - a)^n = f(x)

      Or  

      $$
      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)} (a)}{n!} (x - a)^n = f(x)

      We may write this symbolically as $ Af = (e^{D} - 1) f $, where 1 stands for the  
      "identity operator." Even more symbolically this can be written $ A = e^{D} - 1 $,

      g(0) + \cdots + g(n) = \int_{0}^{n} g(t) dt + \frac{1}{2}(g(n) - g(0))
      $$

      (d) Apply this to g(x) = x^2 to show that
      $$
      \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}

      Using the fact that b_j = -5, show that
      $$
      \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
      $$

      The first ten instances of this formula were written out in Problem 2-7,
      which offered as a challenge the discovery of the general pattern. ‘This
      may now seem to be a preposterous suggestion, but the Bernoulli num-
      bers were actually discovered in precisely this way! After writing out
      these 10 formulas, Bernoulli claims (in his posthumously printed work
      Ars Conjectandi, 1713): "Whoever will examine the series as to their regu-
      larity may be able to continue the table." He then writes down the above
      formula, offering no proof at all, merely noting that the coefficients by
      (which he denoted simply by A, B, C, ... ) satisfy the equation in Prob-
      lem 16(b). The relation between these numbers and the coefficients in
      the power series for z/(e^z - 1) was discovered by Euler.

      The formula in Problem 17(c) can be generalized to the case where $ g $ is not a polynomial function; the infinite sum must be replaced by a finite sum plus a remainder term. In order to find an expression for the remainder, it is useful to introduce some new functions.

      (a) The Bernoulli polynomials $ B_n(x) $, are defined by

      $$
      B_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} B_k x^{n-k}
      $$

      The first three are
      $$
      B_0(x) = 1, \quad B_1(x) = x - \frac{1}{2}, \quad B_2(x) = x^2 - x + \frac{1}{6}
      $$

      Show that
      $$
      B_n(0) = B_n, \quad B_n'(1) = B_n \text{ if } n > 1,
      $$
      $$
      B_n(x) = (-1)^n B_{n}(1 - x),
      $$
      $$
      B_n(x) = (-1)^n B_{n}(1 - x).
      $$

      Hint: Prove the last equation by induction on $ n $.

      (b) Let $ R_N(x) $ be the remainder term in Taylor's Theorem for $ f(x) $ on the interval $ [x, x + 1] $, so that

      $$
      f(x + 1) = \sum_{n=0}^{N} \frac{f^{(n)}(x)}{n!} + R_N(x),
      $$

      Prove that
      $$
      \sum_{k=0}^{N} \binom{N}{k} B_k f(x + 1) = \sum_{k=0}^{N} \binom{N}{k} B_k f(x) - 2 \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \binom{N}{k} B_k R_N(x).
      $$

      Hint: Imitate Problem 17(a). Notice the subscript $ N - k $ on $ R $.

      (c) Use the integral form of the remainder to show that

      $$
      R_N(x) = \int_{x}^{x+1} f(t) (t - x)^N dt.
      $$

      (d) Deduce the "Euler-Maclaurin Summation Formula":

      $$
      \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} g(x + k) = \int_{x}^{x+n} g(t) dt + \frac{1}{2}(g(x + n) - g(x)) + \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{B_k}{k!} g^{(k-1)}(x + n) + S(x, n),
      $$

      where

      $$
      S(x, n) = \sum_{j=0}^{n} \frac{B_j}{j!} \int_{x + j}^{x + j + 1} g^{(j)}(t) dt.
      $$
      - |-
      (e) Let $ y_n(t) $ be the periodic function, with period 1, which satisfies $ y_n(t) = g_n(t) $ for $ 0 < t < 1 $. (Part (a) implies that if $ n > 1 $, then $ y_n $ is continuous, since $ y_n(1) = g_n(0) $, and also that $ y_n $ is even if $ n $ is even and odd if $ n $ is odd.) Show that

      $$
      S_y(x,n) = -\frac{1}{n!} \int_{x+n}^{x+n+1} e^{\gamma(t)} dt
      $$

      $$
      = \left(-\frac{1}{n!}\right)^{+1} \int_{x}^{x+1} e^{\gamma(t)} dt \quad \text{if } x \text{ is an integer}
      $$

      Unlike the remainder in Taylor's Theorem, the remainder $ S_y(x,n) $ usually does not satisfy $ \lim_{n \to \infty} S_y(x,n) = 0 $, because the Bernoulli numbers and functions become large very rapidly (although the first few examples do not suggest this). Nevertheless, important information can often be obtained from the summation formula. The general situation is best discussed within the context of a specialized study ("asymptotic series"), but the next problem shows one particularly important example.

      **19. (a) Use the Euler-Maclaurin Formula, with $ N = 2 $, to show that**

      $$
      \log \left(1 + \frac{1}{n} \right) + \log \left(n - 1 \right)
      $$

      $$
      = \int_{0}^{n} \log t \, dt - \frac{1}{2} \left( \log n + \log 1 \right) - \frac{1}{12} \int_{0}^{n} \frac{1}{t^2} dt
      $$

      (b) Show that

      $$
      \log \left( \frac{S_a}{a} - 12 + \frac{9}{12} \int_{0}^{n} \frac{1}{t^2} dt \right)
      $$

      (c) Explain why the improper integral $ B = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{w_2(t)}{2t^2} dt $ exists, and show that if $ a = \exp(B + 11/12) $, then

      $$
      n! \left( \frac{a}{t} \right)^{2n} e^{-nt} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2n} \right) = \frac{1}{12}
      $$

      (d) Problem 19-41(d) shows that

      $$
      \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{a}{t} \right)^{2n} e^{-nt}
      $$

      Use part (c) to show that

      $$
      \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{a}{t} \right)^{2n} e^{-nt} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a}{(2n)^2} e^{-2n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2n} \right)
      $$

      and conclude that $ a = \sqrt{27} $.

      CHAPTER

      FIELDS

      Throughout this book a conscientious attempt has been made to define all important concepts, even terms like "function," for which an intuitive definition is often considered sufficient. But $ \mathbb{Q} $ and $ \mathbb{R} $, the two main protagonists of this story,
      have only been named, never defined. What has never been defined can never be analyzed thoroughly, and "properties" $ P_1—P_{13} $ must be considered assumptions,
      not theorems, about numbers. Nevertheless, the term "axiom" has been purposely
      avoided, and in this chapter the logical status of $ P_1-P_{13} $ will be scrutinized more
      carefully.
      - |-
      Like Q and R, the sets N and Z have also remained undefined. True, some
      talk about all four was inserted in Chapter 2, but those rough descriptions are far
      from a definition. 'I say, for example, that N consists of 1, 2, 3, etc., merely
      names some elements of N without identifying them (and the "etc." is useless).
      The natural numbers can be defined, but the procedure is involved and not quite
      pertinent to the rest of the book. The Suggested Reading list contains references
      to this problem, as well as to the other steps that are required if one wishes to
      develop calculus from its basic logical starting point. 'The further development
      of this program would proceed with the definition of Z, in terms of N, and the
      definition of Q in terms of Z. This program results in a certain well-defined
      set Q, certain explicitly defined operations + and -, and properties P1—P12 as
      theorems. 'The final step in this program is the construction of R, in terms of Q.
      It is this last construction which concerns us. Assuming that Q has been defined,
      and that PI—P12 have been proved for Q, we shall ultimately define R and prove all
      of P1—P13 for R.

      Our intention of proving P!—P13 means that we must define not only real num-
      bers, but also addition and multiplication of real numbers. Indeed, the real num-
      bers are of interest only as a set together with these operations: how the real
      numbers behave with respect to addition and multiplication is crucial; what the
      real numbers may actually be is quite irrelevant. 'This assertion can be expressed in
      a meaningful mathematical way, by using the concept of a "field," which includes
      as special cases the three important number systems of this book. This extraordi-
      nary important abstraction of modern mathematics incorporates the properties
      P1—P9 common to Q, R, and C. A field is a set F (of objects of any sort what-
      soever), together with two "binary operations" + and « defined on F (that is, two
      rules which associate to elements a and b in F, other elements a + b and a« b
      in F') for which the following conditions are satisfied:
      - |-
      (1) (a+b) +c=a+t+(b+c) for all a,b, and cin F.
      (2) 'There is some element 0 in F such that

      i)a+O0=a _ for all a in F,
      (1) for every a in F, there 1s some element b in F such that a +b = 0.

      58 |

      582 Epilogue

      (3) a+b=b+a _ for all a and bin F.
      (4) (aeb)*c=ae(bec) for all a,b, and c in F.
      (5) 'There is some element 1 in F such that 1 4 0 and
      GQ) ael=a_ for all a in F,
      (1) For every a in F with a # O, there is some element b in F such that
      aeb=1.
      (66)a*b=bea_ for all a and b in F.
      (7) as(b+c) =aeb+a-c for all a,b, and c in F.

      The familiar examples of fields are, as already indicated, Q, R, and C, with
      + and ~ being the familiar operations of + and -. It 1s probably unnecessary to
      explain why these are fields, but the explanation 1s, at any rate, quite brief. When
      + and « are understood to mean the ordinary + and -, the rules (1), (3), (4), (6), (7)
      are simply restatements of P1, P4, P5, P8, P9; the elements which play the role of 0
      and 1 are the numbers 0 and | (which accounts for the choice of the symbols 0, 1);
      and the number b in (2) or (5) is —a or a~!, respectively. (For this reason, in an
      arbitrary field F we denote by —a the element such that a + (—a) = 0, and by
      a~' the element such that a+ a7! = 1, for a £0.)

      In addition to Q, R, and G, there are several other fields which can be described
      - |-

      It is easily. One example is the collection F; of all numbers a + bV/2 for a, b in Q.
      The operations + and + will, once again, be the usual + and - for real numbers.
      It is necessary to point out that these operations really do produce new elements
      of F; 

      (a+ bV2) + (c+dvV2) =(a+c)+(b+d)V2, which is in F);
      (a 4+ bV2) (c+ dv2) = (ac + 2bd) + (be + ad)V2, which is in F}.

      Conditions (1), (3), (4), (6), (7) for a field are obvious for F;: since these hold for
      all real numbers, they certainly hold for all real numbers of the form a + b/2.
      Condition (2) holds because the number 0 = 0+0V2 is in F; and, for a =a+bv2
      in F,; the number B = (—a) + (—b)V2 in F; satisfies a + 6B = 0. Similarly,
      1=1+40V2 is in Fj, so (51) is satisfied. ‘The verification of (51) is the only slightly

      difficult point. If a + b/2 # 0), then

      l
      a+bv2. = |:
      a+bvV2

      it is therefore necessary to show that |/(a + bV/2 )is in Fy. This is true because

      | Z a —bV2 _ a 4 (—b) J3
      a+bV2 (a—bV2)a+bV2) a%— 2b?  a®?—2b*

      (The division by a — b/2 is valid because the relation a — bV2 = 0 could be true
      only if a = b = 0 (since V2 is irrational) which is ruled out by the hypothesis
      a+bV24 0.)

      The next example of a field, F2, is considerably simpler in one respect: it con-
      tains only two elements, which we might as well denote by 0 and 1. ‘The operations
      - |-
      + and « are described by the following tables.

      + 0 ] ° 0 ]
      0 0 ] 0 0 0
      ] ] 0 ] 0 ]

      The verification of conditions (1)—(7) are straightforward, case-by-case checks. For
      example, condition (1) may be proved by checking the 8 equations obtained by
      setting a, b,c =0 or 1. Notice that in this field 1 + 1 = 0; this equation may also
      be written 1 = -1.

      Our final example of a field is rather silly: F3 consists of all pairs (a, a) for a
      in R, and + and « are defined by

      (a,a) + (b,b) =(a+b,a+b),
      (a,a)*(b,b) = (a-b,a-b).

      (The + and - appearing on the right side are ordinary addition and multiplication
      for R.) The verification that F3 is a field is left to you as a simple exercise.

      A detailed investigation of the properties of fields is a study in itself, but for our
      purposes, fields provide an ideal framework in which to discuss the properties of
      numbers in the most economical way. For example, the consequences of P1—P9
      which were derived for "numbers" in Chapter 1 actually hold for any field; in
      particular, they are true for the fields Q, R, and C.

      Notice that certain common properties of Q, R, and C do not hold for all fields.
      For example, it is possible for the equation 1 + 1 = 0 to hold in some fields, and
      consequently a = b = b—a does not necessarily imply that a = b. For the field
      C the assertion 1 + 1 ≠ 0 was derived from the explicit description of Q; for the
      fields Q and R, however, this assertion was derived from further properties which
      do not have analogues in the conditions for a field. There is a related concept
      which does use these properties. An ordered field is a field F (with operations +
      and «) together with a certain subset P of F (the "positive" elements) with the
      following properties:
      - |-
      (8) For all a in F, one and only one of the following 1s true:
      (i) a=0,
      (1) a is in P,
      (ill) —a is in P.
      (9) If a and b are in P, then a + b is in P.
      (10) If a and b are in P, then a+ b is in P.

      We have already seen that the field C cannot be made into an ordered field.
      The field F2, with only two elements, likewise cannot be made into an ordered
      field: in fact, condition (8), applied to 1 = —1, shows that 1 must be in P; then (9)
      implies that 1 + 1 = 0 is in P, contradicting (8). On the other hand, the field F3,

      consisting of all numbers a + b√2 with a,b in Q, certainly can be made into
      an ordered field: let P be the set of all a + b√2 which are positive real numbers
      (in the ordinary sense). The field F3 can also be made into an ordered field; the
      description of P is left to you.

      It is natural to introduce notation for an arbitrary ordered field which corre-
      sponds to that used for Q and R: we define

      a > b if a − b is in P,
      a < b if b > a,

      a ≤ b if a < b or a = b,
      a ≥ b iff a > b or a = b.

      Using these definitions we can reproduce, for an arbitrary ordered field F,
      the definitions of Chapter 7:

      A set A of elements of F is bounded above if there is some x in F such
      that x ≥ a for all a in A. Any such x is called an upper bound for A. An
      element x of F is a least upper bound for A if x is an upper bound for A
      and x ≤ y for every y in F which is an upper bound for A.

      Finally, it is possible to state an analogue of property P13 for R; this leads to the
      last abstraction of this chapter:

      A complete ordered field is an ordered field in which every nonempty set
      which is bounded above has a least upper bound.
      - |-
      The consideration of fields may seem to have taken us far from the goal of constructing the real numbers. However, we are now provided with an intelligible means of formulating this goal. There are two questions which will be answered in the remaining two chapters:

      1. Is there a complete ordered field?
      2. Is there only one complete ordered field?

      Our starting point for these considerations will be Q, assumed to be an ordered field, containing N and Z as certain subsets. At one crucial point it will be necessary to assume another fact about Q:

      Let x be an element of Q with x > 0. Then for any y in Q there is some n in N such that nx > y.

      This assumption, which asserts that the rational numbers have the Archimedean property of the real numbers, does not follow from the other properties of an ordered field (for the example that demonstrates this conclusively see reference [14] of the Suggested Reading). The important point for us is that when Q is explicitly constructed, properties PI—P12 appear as theorems, and so does this additional
      assumption; if we really began from the beginning, no assumptions about Q would be necessary.

      CONSTRUCTION OF THE
      REAL NUMBERS

      The mass of drudgery which this chapter necessarily contains is relieved by one
      truly first-rate idea. In order to prove that a complete ordered field exists we will
      have to explicitly describe one in detail; verifying conditions (1)—(10) for an ordered
      field will be a straightforward ordeal, but the description of the field itself, of the
      elements in it, is ingenious indeed.
      - |-
      At our disposal is the set of rational numbers, and from this raw material it is
      necessary to produce the field which will ultimately be called the real numbers.
      ‘To the uninitiated this must seem utterly hopeless—if only the rational numbers
      are known, where are the others to come from? By now we have had enough
      experience to realize that the situation may not be quite so hopeless as that casual
      consideration suggests. [he strategy to be adopted in our construction has already
      been used effectively for defining functions and complex numbers. Instead of
      trying to determine the "real nature" of these concepts, we settled for a definition
      that described enough about them to determine their mathematical properties
      completely.

      A simular proposal for defining real numbers requires a description of real num-
      bers in terms of rational numbers. The observation, that a real number ought to
      be determined completely by the set of rational numbers less than it, suggests a
      strikingly simple and quite attractive possibility: a real number might (and in fact
      eventually will) be described as a collection of rational numbers. In order to make
      this proposal effective, however, some means must be found for describing "the
      set of rational numbers less than a real number" without mentioning real num-
      bers, which are still nothing more than heuristic figments of our mathematical
      imagination.

      If A is to be regarded as the set of rational numbers which are less than the
      real number @, then A ought to have the following property: If x 1s in A and y
      is a rational number satisfying y < x, then y is in A. In addition to this property,
      the set A should have a few others. Since there should be some rational number
      x < a, the set A should not be empty. Likewise, since there should be some
      rational number x > a@, the set A should not be all of Q. Finally, if x < a, then
      there should be another rational number y with x < y < a@, so A should not
      contain a greatest member.
      - |-
      If we temporarily regard the real numbers as known, then it is not hard to  
      check (Problem 8-17) that a set A with these properties is indeed the set of rational  
      numbers less than some real number a. Since the real numbers are presently  
      in limbo, your proof, if you supply one, must be regarded only as an unofficial  
      comment on these proceedings. It will serve to convince you, however, that we  
      have not failed to notice any crucial property of the set A. There appears to be  
      no reason for hesitating any longer.

      DEFINITION

      29. Construction of the Real Numbers 589  

      A real number is a set @, of rational numbers, with the following four proper-  
      ties:  

      is some y nq with y > x.  

      The set of all real numbers is denoted by R.  

      Just to remind you of the philosophy behind our definition, here is an explicit  
      example of a real number:  

      a ={xinQ:x <Oorx' <2}.  

      It should be clear that @ is the real number which will eventually be known as √2,  
      but it is not an entirely trivial exercise to show that @ actually is a real number.  
      The whole point of such an exercise is to prove this using only facts about Q;  
      the hard part will be checking condition (4), but this has already appeared as a  
      problem in a previous chapter (finding out which one is up to you). Notice that  
      condition (4), although quite bothersome here, is really essential in order to avoid  
      ambiguity; without it both  

      {x inQ:x < √2}  
      and  

      {x inQ:x< 1}  

      would be candidates for the "real number 1."
      - |-
      The shift from A to @ in our definition indicates both a conceptual and a no-
      tational concern. Henceforth, a real number 1s, by definition, a set of rational
      numbers. ‘This means, in particular, that a rational number (a member of Q)
      is not a real number; instead every rational number x has a natural counterpart
      which is a real number, namely, {y in Q.: y < x}. After completing the construc-
      tion of the real numbers, we can mentally throw away the elements of Q and
      agree that Q wil henceforth denote these special sets. For the moment, however,
      it will be necessary to work at the same time with rational numbers, real numbers
      (sets of rational numbers) and even sets of real numbers (sets of sets of rational
      numbers). Some confusion 1s perhaps inevitable, but proper notation should keep
      this to a minimum. Rational numbers will be denoted by lower case Roman letters
      (x, y, Z, a, b, c) and real numbers by lower case Greek letters (@, B, y); capital
      Roman letters (A, B, C) will be used to denote sets of real numbers.

      The remainder of this chapter 1s devoted to the definition of +, +, and P for R,
      and a proof that with these structures R is indeed a complete ordered field.

      We shall actually begin with the definition of P, and even here we shall work
      backwards. We first define a < f; later, when +, -, and 0 are available, we shall
      define P as the set of all @ with 0 <a, and prove the necessary properties for P.

      590) = Epilogue

      THEOREM

      PROOF

      The reason for beginning with the definition of < is the simplicity of this concept
      in Our present setup:

      Defintion. If @ and B are real numbers, then a < B means that @ is contained in
      B (that is, every element of @ 1s also an element of 8), but a ¥ B.

      A repetition of the definitions of <, >, 2 would be stultifying, but it is interesting
      to note that < can now be expressed more simply than <; if @ and 8 are real
      numbers, then a S 6 if and only if @ 1s contained in £.

      If A is a bounded collection of real numbers, it is almost obvious that A should
      have a least upper bound. Each @ in A 1s a collection of rational numbers; if these
      rational numbers are all put in one collection 6, then 6 is presumably sup A. In
      the proof of the following theorem we check all the little detauls which have not
      been mentioned, not least of which is the assertion that B zs a real number. (We
      will not bother numbering theorems in this chapter, since they all add up to one
      big Theorem: There is a complete ordered field.)

      If A is a set of real numbers and A ¥ @ and A is bounded above, then A has a
      least upper bound.

      Let B = {x : x isinsome ain A}. Then # 1s certainly a collection of rational
      numbers; the proof that 6 is a real number requires checking four facts.

      (1) Suppose that x is in B and y < x. The first condition means that x 1s in @
      for some a@ in A. Since @ is a real number, the assumption y < x implies
      that y is in qa. [Therefore it is certainly true that y 1s in B.

      (2) Since A 4 @, there is some @ in A. Since @ is a real number, there is some
      x nq. This means that x is in B, so B 4.

      (3) Since A 1s bounded above, there is some real number y such that a < y
      for every a in A. Since y 1s a real number, there is some rational number
      x which is not in y. Nowa < y means that @ is contained in y, so it 1s
      also true that x is not in @ for any a in A. This means that x 1s not in 6;
      sop #Q.

      (4) Suppose that x is in B. Then x 1s in @ for some @ in A. Since @ does not
      have a greatest member, there is some rational number y with x < y and y
      ina. But this means that y 1s in 6; thus 6 does not have a greatest member.
      - |-

      These four observations prove that B is a real number. The proof that 6 is the least upper bound of A is easier. If @ is in A, then clearly @ is contained in B; this means that a < f, so B is an upper bound for A. On the other hand, if y is an upper bound for A, then a@ ≤ y for every @ in A; this means that @ is contained in y, for every a in A, and this surely implies that B is contained in y. Thus, in turn, means that B ≤ y; thus £ is the least upper bound of A.

      The definition of + is both obvious and easy, but it must be complemented with a proof that this "obvious" definition makes any sense at all.

      29. Construction of the Real Numbers 591

      Definition. If a and f are real numbers, then

      a + B = {x : x = y + z for some y in a and some z in f}.

      THEOREM. If a and f are real numbers, then a + B is a real number.

      PROOF. Once again four facts must be verified.

      (1) Suppose w < x for some x in a + B. Then x = y + z for some y in a and some z in B, which means that w < y + z, and consequently, w − y < z. This shows that w − y is in B (since z is in B, and B is a real number). Since w = y + (w − y), it follows that w is in a + B.

      (2) It is clear that a + B ≠ ∅, since a ∈ a and B ≠ ∅.

      (3) Since a ⊆ Q and B ⊆ Q, there are rational numbers a and b with a not in a and b not in B. Any x in a satisfies x < a (for if a < x, then condition (1) for a real number would imply that a is in a); similarly any y in B satisfies y < b. Thus x + y < a + b for any x ∈ a and y ∈ B. This shows that a + B ≠ Q, so a + B ⊆ Q.

      (4) Suppose that x and y are in a + B. Then x = y₁ + z₁ and y = y₂ + z₂ for some y₁, y₂ ∈ a and z₁, z₂ ∈ B. Then x + y = (y₁ + y₂) + (z₁ + z₂). Since y₁ + y₂ ∈ a and z₁ + z₂ ∈ B, it follows that x + y is in a + B. Thus, a + B is closed under addition.

      Therefore, a + B is a real number.
      - |-
      (4) If x is in a + B, then x = y + z for y in a@ and z in Bf. There are y' in a@ and z' in B with y < y' and z < z'; then x < y' + z' and y' + z' is in a + B. Thus a + B has no greatest member. J

      By now you can see how tiresome this whole procedure is going to be. Every time we mention a new real number, we must prove that it is a real number; this requires checking four conditions, and even when trivial they require concentration. "There is really no help for this (except that it will be less boring if you check the four conditions for yourself). Fortunately, however, a few points of interest will arise now and then, and some of our theorems will be easy. In particular, two properties of + present no problems.

      THEOREM If a, b, and y are real numbers, then (a + b) + y = a + (b + y).

      PROOF Since (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) for all rational numbers x, y, and z, every member of (a + b) + y is also a member of a + (b + y), and vice versa. J

      THEOREM If a and b are real numbers, then a + b = b + a.
      PROOF — Left to you (even easier). J

      To prove the other properties of + we first define 0.
      Definition. 0 = {x ∈ Q: x < 0}.

      It is, thank goodness, obvious that 0 is a real number, and the following theorem is also simple.
      592 Epilogue

      THEOREM
      PROOF
      If a is a real number, then a + 0 = a.

      If x is in a@ and y is in 0, then y < 0, so x + y < x. This implies that x + y is in a.
      Thus every member of a + 0 is also a member of a.
      - |-
      On the other hand, if x is in a, then there 1s a rational number y in @ such that
      y > x. Since x = y + (x — y), where y is in a, and x — y < O (so that x — y is
      in 0), this shows that x is in a + 0. Thus every member of @ is also a member

      of a +0. fj

      The reasonable candidate for —a would seem to be the set
      {x in Q : —x 1s not in @}

      (since —x not in a means, intuitively, that —x > a, so that x < —q@). But in certain
      cases this set will not even be a real number. Although a real number a@ does not
      have a greatest member, the set

      Q -a= {x nQ:x 1s not ing}

      may have a least element x9; when @ is a real number of this kind, the set
      {x : —x 1s not in a} will have a greatest element —xg. It 1s therefore necessary to
      introduce a slight modification into the definition of —a, which comes equipped
      with a theorem.

      Definition. If a is a real number, then

      —a = {x inQ :—-x 1s not ina, but — x is not the least element of Q — a}.

      If w is a real number, then —a@ 1s a real number.

      (1) Suppose that x isin —a@ and y < x. Then —y > —x. Since —x 1s not ina,
      it is also true that —y is not in a. Moreover, it is clear that —y is not the
      smallest element of Q — a, since —x 1s a smaller element. ‘This shows that
      yisin =a.

      (2) Since a # Q, there is some rational number y which is not in a. We can
      assume that y is not the smallest rational number in Q — @ (since y can
      always be replaced by any y' > y). Then —y 1s in —a. Thus —a ¥ @.
      - |-
      (3) Since a 4 @, there is some x in a. Then —x cannot possibly be in —a, so
      -« £Q.

      (4) If x is in —a@, then —x 1s not in a, and there 1s a rational number y < —x
      which is also not in a. Let z be a rational number with y < z < —x. Then
      z is also not in qa, and z 1s clearly not the smallest element of Q — a. So
      —z 1s in —a@. Since —z > x, this shows that —a does not have a greatest
      element. J

      The proof that a + (—a) = 0 is not entirely straightforward. The difficulties
      are not caused, as you might presume, by the finicky details in the definition
      of —a. Rather, at this point we require the Archimedean property of Q stated on
      page 584, which does not follow from P1—P12. This property 1s needed to prove
      the following lemma, which plays a crucial role in the next theorem.

      LEMMA

      Let a be a real number, and z a positive rational number. Then there are (Figure 1)
      rational numbers x in @, and y not in a, such that y — x = z. Moreover, we may
      assume that y is not the smallest element of Q — a.

      Suppose first that z is in a. If the numbers

      z, 2z, 3Z,...

      were all in a, then every rational number would be in @, since every rational num-
      ber w satisfies w < nz for some n, by the additional assumption on page 584. This
      contradicts the fact that a is a real number, so there is some k such that x = kz 1s
      in a@ and y = (k + 1)z is not in a. Clearly y — x = z.

      Moreover, if y happens to be the smallest element of Q — a@, let x" > x be an
      element of a, and replace x by x', and y by y + (x' — x).
      - |-
      If z is not in a, there is a similar proof, based on the fact that the numbers (—n)z
      cannot all fail to be in a. J

      Z
      —
      a
      FIGURE | x y
      If @ is a real number, then
      a + (—a) — 0.

      Suppose x is in @ and y is in —a@. Then —y is not in a, so —y > x. Hence
      x+y <0,sox+yisin 0. Thus every member of a + (=a) is in 0.

      It is a little more difficult to go in the other direction. If z is in 0, then —z > 0.
      According to the lemma, there is some x in a, and some y not in q@, with y not the
      smallest element of Q — a, such that y — x = —z. This equation can be written
      x+(—y) =z. Since x is in a, and —y is in —a, this proves that z is in a + (—a). J

      Before proceeding with multiplication, we define the "positive elements" and
      prove a basic property:

      Definition. P = {a in R: a > O}.

      Notice that @ + 6 is clearly in P if a and 6 are.

      994 Epilogue

      THEOREM

      PROOF

      THEOREM

      PROOF

      THEOREM

      If @ is a real number, then one and only one of the following conditions holds:

      (ai) a= 0,
      (1) @ is in P,
      (il) —a@ is in P.

      If @ contains any positive rational number, then @ certainly contains all negative
      rational numbers, so @ contains 0 and a # Q, i.e., a is in P. If @ contains no
      positive rational numbers, then one of two possibilities must hold:

      (1) @ contains all negative rational numbers; then a = 0.
      - |-
      (2) there is some negative rational number x which is not in a; it can be assumed that x 1s not the least element of Q — a (since x could be replaced by x/2 > x); then —a@ contains the positive rational number —x, so, as we have just proved, —a@ 1s in P.

      This shows that at least one of (1)-Qn) must hold. If @ = 0, it is clearly impossible for condition (11) or (1) to hold. Moreover, it 1s impossible that a > 0 and —a > 0 both hold, since this would imply that 0 = a + (—a) > 0. J

      Recall that @ > B was defined to mean that @ contains B, but is unequal to B. This definition was fine for proving completeness, but now we have to show that it is equivalent to the definition which would be made in terms of P. 'Thus, we must show that a — B > O 1s equivalent to a > B. This is clearly a consequence of the next theorem.

      If a, B, and y are real numbers and a > B, then a + y > B + y.

      The hypothesis a > B implies that B is contained in a; it follows immediately from the definition of + that B + y is contained in a + y. This shows that a + y = B + y. We can easily rule out the possibility of equality, for if

      a + y = B + y,

      then
      a = (a + y) + (—y) = (B + y) + (—y) = B,

      which is false. Thus a — y > B + y. §

      Multiplication presents difficulties of its own. If a, B > 0, then a + B can be defined as follows.

      Definition. If @ and B are real numbers and a, B > 0, then

      a · B = {z: z < 0 or z = x − y for some x in @ and y in B with x, y > 0}.

      If a and B are real numbers with a, B > 0, then @ · B is a real number.

      29. Construction of the Real Numbers 595

      PROOF — As usual, we must check four conditions.
      - |-
      (1) Suppose $ w < z $, where $ z $ is a real number. If $ w < 0 $, then $ w $ is automatically in $ \mathbb{Q} + \mathbb{B} $. Suppose that $ w > 0 $. Then $ z > 0 $, so $ z = x - y $ for some positive $ x $ in $ \mathbb{Q} $ and positive $ y $ in $ \mathbb{B} $. Now

      $$
      wz = w(x - y)
      $$

      Since $ 0 < w < z $, we have $ \frac{w}{z} < 1 $, so $ \frac{w}{z} - x $ is negative. Thus $ w $ is in $ \mathbb{Q} + \mathbb{B} $.

      (2) Clearly $ \mathbb{Q} - \mathbb{B} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} $.

      (3) If $ x $ is not in $ \mathbb{Q} $, and $ y $ is not in $ \mathbb{B} $, then $ x > x' $ for all $ x' \in \mathbb{Q} $, and $ y > y' $ for all $ y' \in \mathbb{B} $. Hence $ xy > x'y' $ for all such positive $ x' $ and $ y' $. So $ xy $ is not in $ \mathbb{Q} + \mathbb{B} $; thus $ \mathbb{Q} - \mathbb{B} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} $.

      (4) Suppose $ w $ is in $ \mathbb{Q} + \mathbb{B} $, and $ w < 0 $. There is some $ x $ in $ \mathbb{Q} $ with $ x > 0 $ and some $ y $ in $ \mathbb{B} $ with $ y > 0 $. Then $ z = xy $ is in $ \mathbb{Q} + \mathbb{B} $ and $ z > w $. Now suppose $ w > 0 $. Then $ w = xy $ for some positive $ x $ in $ \mathbb{Q} $ and some positive $ y $ in $ \mathbb{B} $. Moreover, $ \mathbb{Q} $ contains some $ x' > x $; if $ z = x'y $, then $ z > xy = w $, and $ z $ is in $ \mathbb{Q} + \mathbb{B} $. Thus $ \mathbb{Q} + \mathbb{B} $ does not have a greatest element.

      Notice that $ \mathbb{Q} + \mathbb{B} $ is clearly in $ P $ if $ \mathbb{Q} $ and $ \mathbb{B} $ are. This completes the verification of all properties of $ P $. To complete the definition of $ + $ we first define $ [a] $.

      Definition. If $ a $ is a real number, then

      $$
      [a] = \mathbb{Q}, \text{ if } a > 0
      $$
      $$
      [-a], \text{ if } a < 0.
      $$

      Definition. If $ a $ and $ b $ are real numbers, then

      $$
      0, \text{ if } a = 0 \text{ or } b = 0
      $$
      $$
      |a| - |b|, \text{ if } a > 0, b > 0 \text{ or } a < 0, b < 0
      $$
      $$
      - (|a| - |b|), \text{ if } a > 0, b < 0 \text{ or } a < 0, b > 0.
      $$

      As one might suspect, the proofs of the properties of multiplication usually involve reduction to the case of positive numbers.

      If a is a real number, then a - 1 = a.

      Let a > 0. It is easy to see that every member of a «1 is also a member of aq.

      On the other hand, suppose x is in a. If x < 0, then x is automatically in a «1.

      If x > 0, then there is some rational number y in a such that x < y. Then

      x = y - (x/y), and x/y is in 1, so x is in a. This proves that a - 1 = a if a > 0.
      If a < 0, then, applying the result just proved, we have

      (2) Clearly a@! ≠ @.

      (4) Suppose x is in a@!. If x < 0, there is clearly some y in a@! with y > x because a@! contains some positive rationals. If x > 0, then 1/x is not in a. Since 1/x is not the smallest member of Q — a, there is a rational number y not in a, with y < 1/x. Choose a rational number z with y < z < 1/x. Then 1/z is in a@!, and 1/z > x. Thus a@! does not contain a largest member.

      In order to prove that a@! is really the multiplicative inverse of a, it helps to have another lemma, which is the multiplicative analogue of our first lemma.

      Let a be a real number with a > 0, and z a rational number with z > 1. Then there are rational numbers x in a, and y not in a, such that y/x = z. Moreover, we can assume that y is not the least element of Q — a.

      Suppose first that z is in Q. Since z — 1 > O and
      Z2 = (1 + (—-)))" 2 1 + nz — I),

      it follows that the numbers
      z z? 2°

      cannot all be in a. So there is some k such that x = z is in a, and y = z‘t! is not
      - |-
      In a. Clearly y/x = z. Moreover, if y happens to be the least element of Q — a,
      let x' > x be an element of a, and replace x by x' and y by yx'/x.

      If z is not in q@, there is a similar proof, based on the fact that the numbers 1 /z*
      cannot all fail to be ina. J

      If w is a real number and a + 0, then w+ a7! = 1.

      It obviously suffices to consider only a > 0, in which case a! > 0. Suppose that
      x is a positive rational number in @, and y is a positive rational number in a7}.
      Then 1/y is not in a@, so 1/y > x; consequently xy < 1, which means that xy is
      in 1. Since all rational numbers x < 0 are also in 1, this shows that every member
      of aea7! isin 1.

      To prove the converse assertion, let z be in 1. If z < 0, then clearly z is in
      a+a-!. Suppose 0 < z < 1. According to the lemma, there are positive rational
      numbers x in a, and y not ina, such that y/x = 1/z; and we can assume that y
      is not the smallest element of Q — a. But this means that z = x - (1/y), where x

      is in a, and 1/y is in a~!. Consequently, z is ina-a7!. §

      We are almost done! Only the proof of the distributive law remains. Once again
      we must consider many cases, but do not despair. ‘The case when all numbers are
      positive contains an interesting point, and the other cases can all be taken care of
      very neatly.

      Assume first that a, B, y > 0. Then both numbers in the equation contain all
      rational numbers < 0. A positive rational number in a + (B + y) is of the form
      x - (y + z) for positive x in a, y in B, and z in y. Since x - (y + z) = x - y + x - z,
      where x - y is a positive element of a + B, and x - z is a positive element of a + y,
      this number is also in a + B # a + y. Thus, every element of a + (B + y) is also in
      a + B # a + y.

      On the other hand, a positive rational number in a + B + a y is of the form
      x1 + y + x2 - z2 for positive x1, x2 in a, y in B, and z2 in y. If x1 < x2, then
      (x1 / x2) + y < y, so (x1 / x2) - y is in B. Thus

      x1 + y + x2 - z2 = x2[(x1 / x2) y + z2]

      is in a + (B + y). Of course, the same trick works if x2 < x1.
      To complete the proof it is necessary to consider the cases when a, B, and y
      are not all > 0. If any one of the three equals 0, the proof is easy and the cases
      involving a < 0 can be derived immediately once all the possibilities for B and
      y have been accounted for. Thus we assume a > 0 and consider three cases:
      B < 0, and B < 0, y > 0, and B > 0, y < 0. The first follows immediately from
      the case already proved, and the third follows from the second by interchanging B
      and y. Therefore we concentrate on the case B < 0, y > 0. There are then two
      possibilities:

      (1) B + y = 0. Then
      a * y = a * (|B| + y) + a * (-|B|),
      SO

      a - (B + y) = - (a - |B|) + a - y

      (2) B + y < 0. Then

      This proof completes the work of the chapter. Although long and frequently  
      tedious, this chapter contains results sufficiently important to be read in detail at  
      least once (and preferably not more than once!). For the first time we know that we  
      have not been operating in a vacuum—there is indeed a complete ordered field, the  
      theorems of this book are not based on assumptions which can never be realized. One interesting and horrid possibility remains: there may be several complete  
      ordered fields. If this is true, then the theorems of calculus are unexpectedly rich  
      in content, but the properties P1—P13 are disappointingly incomplete. The last  
      chapter disposes of this possibility; properties P1-P13 completely characterize the  
      real numbers—anything that can be proved about real numbers can be proved on  
      the basis of these properties alone.

      PROBLEMS

      There are only two problems in this set, but each asks for an entirely different  
      construction of the real numbers! The detailed examination of another construc-  
      tion is recommended only for masochists, but the main idea behind these other  
      constructions is worth knowing. The real numbers constructed in this chapter  
      might be called "the algebraist's real numbers," since they were purposely defined  
      so as to guarantee the least upper bound property, which involves the ordering <,  
      an algebraic notion. The real number system constructed in the next problem  
      might be called "the analyst's real numbers," since they are devised so that Cauchy  
      sequences will always converge.

      1. Since every real number ought to be the limit of some Cauchy sequence  
      of rational numbers, we might try to define a real number to be a Cauchy  
      sequence of rational numbers. Since two Cauchy sequences might converge  
      to the same real number, however, this proposal requires some modifications.
      - |-
      (a) Define two Cauchy sequences of rational numbers $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ to be equivalent (denoted by $\{a_n\} \sim \{b_n\}$) if $\lim (a_n - b_n) = 0$. Prove that  
      $\{a_n\} \sim \{a_n\}$, that $\{b_n\} \sim \{a_n\}$ if $\{a_n\} \sim \{b_n\}$, and that $\{a_n\} \sim \{b_n\}$ if $\{a_n\} \sim \{c_n\}$ and $\{b_n\} \sim \{c_n\}$.

      (b) Suppose that $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of all sequences equivalent to $\{a_n\}$, and $\mathcal{B}$ is the set of all sequences equivalent to $\{b_n\}$. Prove that either $\mathcal{A} \cap \mathcal{B} = \emptyset$ or $\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{B}$. If $\mathcal{A} \cap \mathcal{B} \neq \emptyset$, then there is some $\{c_n\}$ in both $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$. Show that in this case $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ both consist precisely of those sequences equivalent to $\{c_n\}$.

      Part (b) shows that the collection of all Cauchy sequences can be split up into disjoint sets, each set consisting of all sequences equivalent to some fixed sequence. We define a real number to be such a collection, and denote the set of all real numbers by $\mathbb{R}$.

      (c) If $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are real numbers, let $\{a_n\}$ be a sequence in $\mathcal{A}$, and $\{b_n\}$ a sequence in $\mathcal{B}$. Define $a + b$ to be the collection of all sequences equivalent to the sequence $\{a_n + b_n\}$. Show that $\{a_n + b_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence and also show that this definition does not depend on the particular sequences $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ chosen for $a$ and $b$. Check also that the analogous definition of multiplication is well defined.

      (d) Show that $\mathbb{R}$ is a field with these operations; existence of a multiplicative inverse is the only interesting point to check.

      (e) Define the positive real numbers $\mathbb{P}$ so that $\mathbb{R}$ will be an ordered field.

      (f) Prove that every Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges. Remember that if $\{\alpha_n\}$ is a sequence of real numbers, then each $\alpha_n$ is itself a collection of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers.

      This problem outlines a construction of "the high-school student's real numbers." We define a real number to be a pair (a, {b,}), where a is an integer and {b,} is a sequence of natural numbers from 0 to 9, with the proviso that the sequence is not eventually 9; intuitively, this pair represents a + Σ b,10^{-n}. With this definition, a real number is a very concrete object, but the difficulties involved in defining addition and multiplication are formidable (how do you add infinite decimals without worrying about carrying digits infinitely far out?). A reasonable approach is outlined below; the trick is to use least upper bounds right from the start.

      (a) Define (a, {b,}) < (c, {d,}) if a < c, or if a = c and for some n we have b_n < d_n but b_j = d_j for j < n. Using this definition, prove the least upper bound property.

      (b) Given a = (a, {b_n}), define a_n = a + Σ b_n 10^{-n}; intuitively, a_n is the rational number obtained by changing all decimal places after the kth to 0. Conversely, given a rational number r of the form a + Σ b_n 10^{-n}, let r' denote the real number (a, {b'_n}), where b'_n = b_n for 1 ≤ n ≤ k and b'_n = 0 for n > k. Now for a = (a, {b_n}) and B = (c, {d_n}), define a + B = sup{(a_n + B_n)': : k a natural number} (the least upper bound exists by part (a)). If multiplication is defined similarly, then the verification of all conditions for a field is a straightforward task, not highly recommended. Once more, however, existence of multiplicative inverses will be the hardest.

      CHAPTER

      UNIQUENESS OF THE REAL NUMBERS
      - |-
      We shall now revert to the usual notation for real numbers, reserving boldface
      symbols for other fields which may turn up. Moreover, we will regard integers and
      rational numbers as special kinds of real numbers, and forget about the specific
      way in which real numbers were defined. In this chapter we are interested in only
      one question: are there any complete ordered fields other than R? The answer
      to this question, if taken literally, is "yes." For example, the field F3 introduced in
      Chapter 28 is a complete ordered field, and it is certainly not R. This field is a
      "silly" example because the pair (a, a) can be regarded as just another name for
      the real number a; the operations

      (a,a) + (b,b) =(a+b,a+b),
      (a,a)·(b,b) =(a·b,a·b),

      are consistent with this renaming. This sort of example shows that any intelligent
      consideration of the question requires some mathematical means of discussing such
      renaming procedures.

      If the elements of a field F are going to be used to rename elements of R, then
      for each a in R there should correspond a "name" f(a) in F. The notation f(a)
      suggests that renaming can be formulated in terms of functions. In order to do
      this we will need a concept of function much more general than any which has
      occurred until now; in fact, we will require the most general notion of "function"
      used in mathematics. A function, in this general sense, is simply a rule which
      assigns to some things, other things. To be formal, a function is a collection of
      ordered pairs (of objects of any sort) which does not contain two distinct pairs with
      the same first element. The domain of a function f is the set A of all objects a
      such that (a, b) is in f for some b; this (unique) b is denoted by f(a). If f(a) is
      in the set B for all a in A, then f is called a function from A to B. For example,

      if f(x) = sinx for all x in R (and f is defined only for x in R), then f is a

      from R to F3.

      (1) The function f should be one-one, that is, if x 4 y, then we should have
      f(x) # f(y); this means that no two elements of F; have the same name.

      (2) The function f should be "onto," that is, for every element z in F> there

      DEFINITION If F, and Fy are two fields, an isomorphism from F; to Fy is a function f
      from F, to Fy with the following properties:

      If F, and Fy are ordered fields we also require:

      (4) If x < y, then f(x) < f(y).

      The fields F, and Fy are called isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between
      them. Isomorphic fields may be regarded as essentially the same—any important
      property of one will automatically hold for the other. Therefore, we can, and
      should, reformulate the question asked at the beginning of the chapter; if F is a
      complete ordered field it is silly to expect F to equal R —rather, we would like to
      know if F is isomorphic to R. In the following theorem, F will be a field, with
      operations + and ·, and "positive elements" P; we write a < b to mean that b—a
      is in P, and so forth.

      THEOREM

      PROOF

      30. Uniqueness of the Real Numbers 603

      If F is a complete ordered field, then F is isomorphic to R.

      Since two fields are defined to be isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between
      them, we must actually construct a function f from R to F which is an isomor-
      phism. We begin by defining f on the integers as follows:

      f(0) = 0,
      f(n) = 1 + ... + 1 for n > 0,
      n times
      f(n) = - (1 + ... + 1) for n < 0.
      n times

      It is easy to check that

      f(m + n) = f(m) + f(n),
      f(m · n) = f(m) · f(n),

      for all integers m and n, and it is convenient to denote f(n) by n. We then
      define f on the rational numbers by

      f(m/n) = f(m) / f(n).
      - |-

       (notice that the n-fold sum 1 +--- +140 if n > 0, since F 1s an ordered field).
      This definition makes sense because if m/n = k/1, then ml = nk, somel = ken, so
      m+n! =k-I7!. It is easy to check that

      fri +r2) = flr) & f(r2),
      fri -r2) = fri) * f(r2),

      for all rational numbers r; and rz, and that f(r;) < f(r2) if ry <r.

      The definition of f(x) for arbitrary x 1s based on the now familar idea that
      any real number is determined by the rational numbers less than it. For any x
      in R, let A, be the subset of F consisting of all f(r), for all rational numbers
      r <x. The set A, is certainly not empty, and it 1s also bounded above, for if ro
      is a rational number with ro > x, then f(ro) > f(r) for all f(r) in Ay. Since F
      is a complete ordered field, the set A, has a least upper bound; we define f(x) as
      sup Ax.

      We now have f(x) defined in two different ways, first for rational x, and then for
      any x. Before proceeding further, it is necessary to show that these two definitions
      agree for rational x. In other words, if x is a rational number, we want to show
      that

      sup A, = f(x),

      where f(x) here denotes m/n, for x = m/n. This is not automatic, but depends
      on the completeness of F; a slight digression 1s thus required.
      Since F is complete, the elements

      1+...4+1 for natural numbers n
      ee

      n umes
      604 Lpilogue

      form a set which 1s not bounded above; the proof is exactly the same as the proof
      for R (Theorem 8-2). The consequences of this fact for R have exact analogues
      in F: in particular, if a and b are elements of F with a < 5, then there is a rational

      number r such that
      a< f(r) <b.
      - |-
      Having made this observation, we return to the proof that the two definitions of f(x) agree for rational x. If y is a rational number with y < x, then we have already seen that f(y) < f(x). Thus every element of A, is < f(x). Consequently,

      sup A, ≤ f(x).

      On the other hand, suppose that we had
      sup A, < f(x).

      Then there would be a rational number r such that

      sup A, < f(r) < f(x).

      But the condition f(r) < f(x) means that r < x, which means that f(r) is in the set A,; this clearly contradicts the condition sup A, < f(r). This shows that the original assumption is false, so

      sup A, = f(x).

      We thus have a certain well-defined function f from R to F. In order to show that f is an isomorphism we must verify conditions (1)—(4) of the definition. We will begin with (4).

      If x and y are real numbers with x < y, then clearly A, is contained in A,y. Thus

      f(x) = sup A, ≤ sup A,y = f(y).

      To rule out the possibility of equality, notice that there are rational numbers r and s with
      x < r < s < y.

      We know that f(r) < f(s). It follows that

      f(x) ≤ f(r) < f(s) ≤ f(y).

      This proves (4).

      Condition (1) follows immediately from (4): If x ≠ y, then either x < y or y < x; in the first case f(x) < f(y), and in the second case f(y) < f(x); in either case f(x) ≠ f(y).

      To prove (2), let a be an element of F, and let B be the set of all rational numbers r with f(r) < a. The set B is not empty, and it is also bounded above, because there is a rational number s with f(s) > a, so that f(s) > f(r) for r in B, which implies that s > r. Let x be the least upper bound of B; we claim that f(x) = a. In order to prove this it suffices to eliminate the alternatives
      - |-
      f(x) < a,  
      a < f(x).  
      30. Uniqueness of the Real Numbers 605  

      In the first case there would be a rational number r with  

      I(x) < f(r) < a.  

      But this means that x < r and that r is in B, which contradicts the fact that  
      x = sup B. In the second case there would be a rational number r with  

      a < f(r) < f(x).  

      This implies that r < x. Since x = sup B, this means that r < s for some s in B.  
      Hence  

      f(r) < f(s) < a,  

      again a contradiction. Thus f(x) = a, proving (2).  
      To check (3), let x and y be real numbers and suppose that f(x + y) ≠  
      f(x) + f(y). Then either  

      f(x + y) < f(x) + f(y) or f(x) + f(y) < f(x + y).  

      In the first case there would be a rational number r such that  

      f(x + y) < f(r) < f(x) + f(y).  

      But this would mean that  
      x + y < r.  

      Therefore r could be written as the sum of two rational numbers  
      r = r1 + r2, where x < r1 and y < r2.  
      Then, using the facts checked about f for rational numbers, it would follow that  

      f(r) = f(r1 + r2) = f(r1) + f(r2) > f(x) + f(y),  

      a contradiction. The other case is handled similarly.  
      Finally, if x and y are positive real numbers, the same sort of reasoning shows  
      that  

      f(x − y) = f(x) − f(y);  

      the general case is then a simple consequence.
      - |-
      This theorem brings to an end our investigation of the real numbers, and resolves
      any doubts about them: ‘There is a complete ordered field and, up to isomorphism,
      only one complete ordered field. It is an important part of a mathematical educa-
      tion to follow a construction of the real numbers in detail, but it is not necessary
      to refer ever again to this particular construction. It is utterly irrelevant that a real
      number happens to be a collection of rational numbers, and such a fact should
      never enter the proof of any important theorem about the real numbers. Reason-
      able proofs should use only the fact that the real numbers are a complete ordered
      field, because this property of the real numbers characterizes them up to isomor-
      phism, and any significant mathematical property of the real numbers will be true
      for all isomorphic fields. ‘To be candid I should admit that this last assertion is just
      a prejudice of the author, but it is one shared by almost all other mathematicians.

      elements in F), while 0 and 1 on the right denote elements of F'.)

      (b) Show that f(−a) = −f(a) and f(a/b) = f(a)/f(b), for a ≠ 0.

      Here is an opportunity to convince yourself that any significant property of
      a field is shared by any field isomorphic to it. The point of this problem is
      to write out very formal proofs until you are certain that all statements of
      this sort are obvious. Fy and F2 will be two fields which are isomorphic; for
      simplicity we will denote the operations in both by + and ×. Show that:

      (a) If the equation x² + 1 = 0 has a solution in F1, then it has a solution
      in F2.
      (b) If every polynomial equation xⁿ + aₙ₋₁xⁿ⁻¹ + ... + a₀ = 0 with
      aₙ₋₁, ..., a₀ in F1, has a root in F1, then every polynomial equation
      xⁿ + aₙ₋₁xⁿ⁻¹ + ... + a₀ = 0 with aₙ₋₁, ..., a₀ in F2, has a root in F2.

      SUGGESTED READING

      A man ought to read

      just-as inclination leads him;
      for what he reads as a task
      will do him little good.

      SAMUEL JOHNSON

      One purpose of this bibliography is to guide the reader to other sources, but the most important function it can serve is to indicate the variety of mathematical reading available. Consequently, there is an attempt to achieve diversity, but no pretense of being complete. The present plethora of mathematics books would make such an undertaking almost hopeless in any case, and since I have tried to encourage independent reading, the more standard a text, the less likely it is to appear here. In some cases, this philosophy may seem to have been carried to extremes, as some entries in the list cannot be read by a student just finishing a first course of calculus until several years have elapsed. Nevertheless, there are many selections which can be read now, and I can't believe that it hurts to have some idea of what lies ahead.

      For most references, only the title and author have been given, since so many of
      these books have gone through numerous editions and printings, often having gone
      out of print at some point only to be resurrected later on by a different publisher
      (often as an inexpensive paperback by the redoubtable Dover Publications or by
      the Mathematical Association of America). More exact information really isn't
      necessary, since it is now so easy to search for books on-line at Amazon.com and
      other sites.

      f+ 1s used to indicate books whose availability, either new or used, is problematical.
      Author and title searches may turn up other intriguing books by the same author,
      or other books with similar titles. In addition, many of these books will still be
      found in well-stocked academic libraries, perhaps the best place of all to search;
      despite the convenience of the internet, nothing matches the experience of an
      actual (as opposed to a virtual) library, with books stacked according to subject,
      awaiting serendipitous discovery.

      One of the most elementary unproved theorems mentioned in this book is the
      "Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic", that every natural number can be written
      as a product of primes in only one way. This follows from the basic fact alluded
      to on page 444, a proof of which will be found near the beginning of almost
      any book on elementary number theory. Few books have won so enthusiastic an
      audience as

      [1] An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers, by G. H. Hardy and E. M. Wright.
      Two other recommended books are

      [2] A Selection of Problems in the Theory of Numbers, by W. Sierpinski.

      The Fundamental Theorem also applies in more general algebraic settings, see

      references [33] and [34].

      The subject of irrational numbers straddles the fields of number theory and
      analysis. An excellent introduction will be found in

      Together with many historical notes, there are references to some fairly elementary articles in journals. There is also a proof that z 1s transcendental (see also [59]) and, finally, a proof of the "Gelfond-Schneider theorem": If a and b are algebraic, with a £ 0 or 1, and b is irrational, then a? is transcendental.

      All the books listed so far begin with natural numbers, but whenever necessary take for granted the irrational numbers, not to mention the integers and rational numbers. Several books present a construction of the rational numbers from the natural numbers, but one of the most lucid treatments is still to be found in

      [5] Foundations of Analysis, by EK. Landau.
      While many mathematicians are content to accept the natural numbers as a natural starting point, numbers can be defined in terms of sets, the most basic starting point of all. A charming exposition of set theory can be found in a sophisticated little book called

      [6] Naze Set Theory, by P. R. Halmos.
      Another very good introduction is

      [7] Theory of Sets, by E. Kamke.

      Perhaps it is necessary to assure some victims of the "new math" that set theory does have some mathematical content (in fact, some very deep theorems). Using these deep results, Kamke proves that there is a discontinuous function f such that f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x and y.

      Inequalities, which were treated as an elementary topic in Chapters | and 2, actually form a specialized field. A good elementary introduction is provided by

      Geometry is the other main field which can be considered as background for calculus. ‘Uhough Euclid's Elements is still a masterful mathematical work, greater perspective 1s supplied by some more modern texts, which examine foundational questions, non-Euclidean geometry, the role of the "Archimedean axiom" in geom-
      etry, and further results from "classical geometry". Of the following three books,
      the first, listed in previous editions of this book, has probably been supplanted by
      the later ones, which cover some more advanced material, and perhaps require a
      little more sophistication on the part of the reader.

      Almost all treatments of geometry at least mention convexity, which forms an-

       This book contains a carefully arranged sequence of definitions and statements of
      theorems, whose proofs are to be supplied by the reader (worked-out proofs are
      supplied in the back of the book). Its current unavailability is perhaps a testament
      to the lack of interest in working through exercises, which might also apply to
      another geometry book modeled on the same principle:

      Many of the examples in this book come from more advanced topics in analysis,

      Rather revolutionary when it was first published, it might now be considered somewhat old-fashioned, and you might prefer the second in a series of books (3 and counting) that have appeared more recently:

      [37] Complex Analysis, by E. Stein and R. Shakarchi.
      [38] Real Analysis, by E. Stein and R. Shakarchi.

      And, since the topic of "real analysis" [high-octane Calculus] has been broached,
      two classics should be mentioned. The first, affectionately known as "baby Rudin',
      was the source of several problems that appear in this book.

      [39] Principles of Mathematical Analysis, by W. Rudin.
      [40] Functional Analysis, by W. Rudin.

      The subject of "topology" has not been mentioned before, but it has really been
      in the background of many discussions, since it is the natural generalization of the
      ideas about limits and continuity which play such a prominent role in Part II of
      this book. ‘The standard text is now

      [42] Differential Topology, by V. Guillemin and A. Pollack.

      The next few topics, ranging from elementary to very difficult, are included
      in this bibliography because they have been alluded to in the text. The gamma

      The impossibility of integrating certain functions in elementary terms (among them f(x) = e-*") is a fairly esoteric topic. A discussion of the possibilities of integrating in elementary terms, with an outline of the impossibility proofs, and references to the original papers of Liouville, will be found in

      [45] The Integration of Functions of a Single Variable, by G. H. Hardy.

      The basically algebraic ideas behind the arguments were made much clearer over a hundred years after Liouville's work, in the paper

      [46] On Liouville's Theorem on functions with elementary integrals, by M. Rosenlicht; in
      Pacific journal of Mathematics, Volume 24, No. 1 (1968), pp. 153-161. (Also

      available on-line: go to projecteuclid.org and search for Rosenlicht.)
      For a good overview of the subject, and some more recent developments, see

      [47] Integration in finite terms: the Liouville theory, by J. Kasper; in Mathematics
      Magazine, Volume 53, No. 4 (1980), pp. 195-201.

      Reference [46] makes use of the notions of "differential algebra", a field in which
      a related but seemingly more difficult problem had been solved earlier: There are
      simple differential equations (y" + xy = O is a specific example) whose solutions
      cannot be expressed even in terms of indefinite integrals of elementary functions.

      This fact is proved on page 43 of the (60-page) book:
      [48] An Introduction to Differential Algebra, by J. Kaplansky

      A few words should also be said in defense of the process of integrating in
      elementary terms, which many mathematicians look upon as an art (unlike differ-
      entiation, which is merely a skill). You are probably already aware that the process
      of integration can be expedited by tables of indefinite integrals. There are several
      books containing extensive tables of integrals (and also tables of series and prod-
      ucts), but for most integrations it suffices to consult one of the fairly extensive tables
      of indefinite integrals that are available on-line, for example, at sosmath.com, and
      at wikipedia.org, with its ever-expanding source of generally definitive entries for
      mathematics and physics.

      The remaining references are of a somewhat different sort. They fall into three
      categories, of which the first is historical.

      For the history of calculus itself, an excellent comprehensive source, filled with
      detailed explicit examples, rather than generalized descriptions, is
      [49] The Historical Development of Calculus, by C. H. Edwards, Jr.

      Some historical remarks, and an attempt to incorporate them into the teaching of
      calculus, will be found in

      An admirable textbook on the history of mathematics in general is

      [51] An Introduction to the History of Mathematics, by H. Eves.

      As might be inferred from the quotation on page 39, the basic idea for constructing
      the real numbers is derived from Dedekind, whose contributions can be found in

      [52] Essays on the Theory of Numbers, by R. Dedekind.

      The most important notions of set theory, especially the proper treatment of infinite
      numbers, were first introduced by Cantor, whose work is reproduced in

      Finally, a great deal of interesting historical material may also be found on-line at
      the site www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/

      The second category in this final group of books might be described as "pop-
      ularizations." There are a surprisingly large number of first-rate ones by real
      mathematicians:

      [55] What is Mathematics', by R. Gourant and H. Robbins.

      [58] Famous Problems of Mathematics, by H. Tietze; Graylock Press, 1965.

      One of the most renowned "popularizations" is especially concerned with the
      teaching of mathematics:
      - |-
      [59] Elementary Mathematics from an Advanced Standpoint, by F. Klein (vol. 1: Arithmetic, Algebra, Analysis; vol. 2: Geometry); Dover, 1948.

      Volume 1 contains a proof of the transcendence of $ \sqrt{2} $ which, although not so elementary as the one in [4], is a direct analogue of the proof that $ e $ is transcendental, replacing integrals with complex line integrals. It can be read as soon as the basic facts about complex analysis are known.

      The third category is the very opposite extreme—original papers. The difficulties encountered here are formidable, and I have only had the courage to list one such paper, the source of the quotation for Part IV. It is not even in English, although you do have a choice of foreign languages. The article in the original French is in

      [60] Oeuvres Completes d'Abel.

      It first appeared in a German translation in the Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, Volume 1, 1826. "To compound the difficulties, these references will usually be available only in university libraries. Yet the study of this paper will probably be as valuable as any other reading mentioned here. The reason is suggested by a remark of Abel himself, who attributed his profound knowledge of mathematics to the fact that he read the masters, rather than the pupils.

      gq have no common factor. Then p* = 3g", so p% is divisible by 3, so  
      p must be. Thus, p = 3p' for some natural number p', and conse-

      The same proofs work for V5 and V6, because the equations

      (5n + 2)? = 25n? + 20n +4 = 5(5n* + 4n) +4,

      The circle of radius √5 around (1, 0), since x² — 2x + y² = (x — 1)² + y² — 1.

      Simply observe that the graph of f(x) = m(x — a) + b = mx + (b — ma)
      is a straight line with slope m, which goes through the point (a, b). (The
      important point about this exercise is simply to remember the point slope
      form.)
      The straight line through (a, b) and (c, d) has slope (d — b)/(c — a), so
      the equation follows from part (a).
      When m = m' and b ≠ b'. In that case, there is clearly no number x with
      f(x) = g(x), while such a number x always exists if m ≠ m', namely,
      x = (b' — b)/(m — m').

      If B = 0 and A ≠ 0, then the set is the vertical straight line formed
      by all points (x, y) with x = —C/A. If B ≠ 0, the set is the graph of

      If f(0) = 0 or f(1) = 1, choose x = 0 or 1. If f(0) > 0 = J(0) and
      f(1) < 1=J(1), then Problem 10 applied to f and J implies that f(x) = x
      for some Xx.

      (1) 1 is the greatest element, and the greatest lower bound is 0, which is
      not in the set.

      (1) 1 is the greatest element, and 0 is the least element.

      (v) Since {x : x² +x+1> 0} =R, there is no least upper bound or greatest
      lower bound.
      - |-
      (vii) Since {x : x < 0 and x* + x - —1 < 0} = ([−1 − √5]/2, ∞), the greatest lower bound is [−1 − √5]/2, and the least upper bound is ∞; neither belongs to the set.

      (a) Since A ⊆ ℚ, there is some x in A. Then −x is in −A, so −A ⊆ ℚ. Since A is bounded below, there is some y such that y < x for all x in A. [Then −y > −x for all x in A, so −y > z for all z in −A, so −A is bounded above. Let a = sup(−A). Then a is an upper bound for −A, so, reversing the argument just given, −a is a lower bound for A.

      Moreover, if B is any lower bound for A, then −B is an upper bound for −A, so −B > a, so B < −a. Thus −a is the greatest lower bound for A.

      (a) If n is the largest integer with n < x, then n + 1 > x, but n + 1 < x + 1 < y. So we can let k = n + 1. (Proof that a largest such integer n exists: Since ℕ is not bounded above, there is some natural number n with −n < x < n. There are consequently only a finite number of integers n with −n < n < x. Pick the largest.)

      (b) Since y − x > 0, there is some natural number n with |1/n| < y − x. Since ny − nx > 1, there is, by part (a), an integer k with nx < k < ny, which means that x < k/n < y.

      (c) Choose r + √(5 − r)/2.

      (d) By part (b), there is a rational number r with x < r < y, and therefore a rational number s with x < r < s < y. Apply part (c) to r and −s.

      Let k be the largest integer < x/a (the solution to Problem 5 shows that such a number exists).

      sok+1 <x/a, contradicting the choice of k. SoO < x' <a.

      (a) Since any y in B satishes y > x for all x mn A, any y in B is an upper
      bound for A, so y > sup A.

      (b) Part (a) shows that sup A is a lower bound for B, so sup A < inf B.

      Since x < supA and y < sup B for every x in A, and y in B, it follows that

      x+y <supA+supB. Thus, sup A +sup B 1s an upper bound for A + B, so

      sup(A + B) < supA+sup B. If x and y are chosen in A and B, respectively,
      so that sup A—x < €/2 and sup B—y < é€/2, then sup A+sup B—(x+y) < €.

      Hence,

      sup(A + B) > x + y > sup A +sup B — e€.

      a rigorous reason is required); a little plane geometry shows that this happens
      when @ = B.

      If x is the length of one side of a rectangle of perimeter P, then the length
      of the other side is (P — 2x)/2, so the area is

      x(P — 2x)
      5 ;

      So the rectangle with greatest area occurs when x is the maximum point for f
      on (0, P/2). Since A is continuous on [0, P/2], and A(O) = A(P/2) = 0,
      and A(x) > O for x in (O, P/2), the maximum exists. Since A is differentiable
      on (0, P/2), the minimum point x satisfies

      A(x) =

      We have  

      f(b) — f(a)  
      b—a  

      = f'(x) for some x in (a, b) < m,  
      so f(b) — f(a) < m(b— a).  

      If | f'(x)| < M for all x in [a, b], then —M < f(x) < M, so  

      f(a) — M(b—a) < f(b) < f(a) + M(b—a),  

      or  

      | f(b) — f(a)| < M(b — a).  

      f(x) = —cosx +a for some number a (because f(x) = —cos x is one  
      such function, and any two such functions differ by a constant function).  

      f(x) = x²/4 +a for some number a, so f(x) = x²/20 + ax +b for some  
      numbers a and b.  

      f(x) = x³ + x²/3 +a for some a, so f'(x) = x³/64 + x⁴/12 + ax +b  
      for some a and b, so f(x) = x⁷/24 + x⁶/60 + ax³/2 + bx +c for some  
      numbers a, b, and c. Equivalently, and more simply, f(x) = x⁷/24 +  
      x⁶/60 + ax³ + bx +c for some numbers a, b, and c.  

      Since s'(t) = —32, we have s'(t) = —32t +a for some a, so s(t) =  
      —16t² + at + B for some a and B.  

      Clearly, s(0) = 0 + 0 + 6 and s'(0) = 0 + a. Thus, a = v and B = 6.  
      In this case, so = 0 and up = v, so s(t) = —16t² + vt. The maximum  
      value of s occurs when 0 = s'(t) = —32t + v, or t = v/32, so the  
      maximum value is  

      s(v/32) = —16( v²/32² ) + v( v/32 )  

      = —v²/64 + v²/32  

      = —v²/64 + 2v²/64  

      = v²/64.

      At that moment the velocity is clearly 0, but the acceleration is —32 (as at any time). The weight hits the ground at time ft > 0 when

      or t = v/16 (it takes as long to fall back down as it took to reach the top).
      The velocity is then

In fact, if it were true that b*/4 < Jo x dx, then it would not be possible to make U(f, Pn) as close as desired to bt /4 by choosing n large enough, since each U(f, Pn) > Jo x2 dx, and similarly we cannot have b*/4 > Jo x2 dx.

      11. The first formula is derived by subtracting the second of the following two
      equations from the first:

      cos(m — n)x = cos(mx — nx) = cosmx cos(—nx) — sin mx sin(—nx)
      = cOSmx cosnx + sinmx sinnx,
      cos(m +n)x = cosmx cosnx — sinmxsinnx.

      The other formulas are derived similarly.
      12. It follows from Problem 11 that if m 4 n, then

      | sinmx sinnx dx = 5 [cos(m — n)x — cos(m + n)x]| dx

      **18. (a)** We have:

      $$
      \cos 2x = \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x
      $$

      $$
      = 1 - 2\sin^2 x
      $$

      $$
      = 2\cos^2 x - 1
      $$

      So,

      $$
      \sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}
      $$

      $$
      \cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2}
      $$

      **(b)** These formulas follow from part (a), because $\cos \frac{x}{2} > 0$ and $\sin \frac{x}{2} > 0$ (since $0 < x < \pi$).

      **(c)**

      $$
      \int_{a}^{b} \sin^2 x \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_{a}^{b} 1 - \cos(2x) \, dx = \frac{1}{2} (b - a) - \frac{1}{4} (\sin 2b - \sin 2a)
      $$

      $$
      \int_{a}^{b} \cos^2 x \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_{a}^{b} 1 + \cos(2x) \, dx = \frac{1}{2} (b - a) + \frac{1}{4} (\sin 2b - \sin 2a)

      **Problem 14:**

      The equation 

      $$
      \int e^x \sin x \, dx = e^x \sin x - e^x \cos x - \int e^x \sin x \, dx
      $$

      means that any function $ F $ with $ F'(x) = e^x \sin x $ can be written as 

      $$
      F(x) = e^x \sin x - e^x \cos x - G(x)
      $$

      where $ G $ is another function with $ G'(x) = e^x \sin x $. Of course, $ G = F + c $ for some number $ c $, but it is not necessarily true that $ F = G $.

      For z = x + iy, we need |z|² < 1 — x. This requires that 1 — x > 0, and then our inequality is equivalent to x² + y² < (1 — x)², or  
      x < (1 — y²)/2 (and conversely this inequality implies that x < (1 — y²)/2 so that 1 — x > 0 holds). The set of points x + iy with x = (1 — y²)/2 is the  
      parabola pointing along the second axis, with the point 5 + Oi closest to the origin, and which passes through the points 0 + i and 0 — i; the  
      desired set of complex numbers is the set of points inside this parabola.

      | x + iy |² = x² + y² = x² + (-y)² = |x — iy|².

      (7 + 2)/2 = [(x + iy) + (-iy)]/2 = x.

      (z — z̄)/2i = [(x + iy) — (x — iy)]/2i = y.

      |z|² + |z — w|² = (z + z̄ + w + w̄)/2 + (2 — ww̄ — w) = 2|z|² + 2|w|² = 2(|z|² + |w|²). Geometrically, this says that the sum of the squares of the  
      diagonals of a parallelogram equal the sum of the squares of the sides.
