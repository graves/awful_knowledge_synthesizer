    So stated, the subject matter of this book would not seem to be revolutionary, for the methods of learning how to write have not changed very much since the Sophists first set up their schools of rhetoric in fifth-century Athens. In a sense, however, it is a new approach that is presented here, for the kind of rhetoric set forth in this book has been absent from American classrooms for about a century and has been replaced by other systems of teaching whatever is teachable about composition. In writing this book, the author believes that the elaborate system of the ancients, which taught the student how to find something to say, how to select and organize his material, and how to phrase it in the best possible way, is still useful and effective—perhaps more useful and effective than the various courses of study that replaced it. No system, classical or modern, has been devised that can change students suddenly and irrevocably into masters of elegant prose, but the ancient teachers of rhetoric, refusing to be impressed by the notion of "creative self-expression" until the student had a self to express and a facility for expressing it, succeeded in large part in developing a method which, when well taught, could help students to write and speak effectively.

    Preface

    Classical rhetoric is a positive discipline. Rather than tell the student what not to do, it instructs him in what should be done. Schoolboys of Shakespeare's time crept as unwillingly to class as students do today, but because classical rhetoric prevailed in Renaissance schools, they were not as much intimidated by a blank sheet of paper as their modern counterparts are.

    The first chapter of this book gives a brief explanation of the kind of rhetorical training that flourished in the schools of the West for over two thousand years. The next three chapters develop the three vital parts of classical rhetoric: Chapter II, Discovery of Arguments; Chapter III, Arrangement of Material; Chapter IV, Style. The Appendix provides a history of rhetoric and a bibliography for those who will pursue their interest in the subject.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Training Principles**\n\nCompare and contrast the approach to rhetoric in classical education (as described in the preface) with modern composition instruction.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two key differences in teaching methods between the classical system and contemporary approaches.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the ancient rhetorical method addresses the issue of ''creative self-expression'' as discussed in the text.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the author believes that classical rhetoric is still effective today, using at least two pieces of evidence from the preface.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both historical and modern pedagogical approaches, integrating the text''s arguments about rhetoric''s enduring relevance.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Elements**\n\nUsing the information from Chapter II (Discovery of Arguments), construct an argument for a modern social issue.\n- **Step 1**: Choose a contemporary topic that requires persuasive writing (e.g., climate change, gun control).\n- **Step 2**: Apply the classical method of ''discovering arguments'' to identify at least three supporting points.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the principles of classical rhetoric ensure that these arguments are logically structured and compelling.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate mastery of the argument-building process as described in the text, with clear references to rhetorical strategies from Chapter II.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Rhetorical Education**\n\nEvaluate the claim that ''classical rhetoric is obsolete in modern education.''\n- **Part A**: Use two examples from the preface to support or refute this claim.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the author''s argument that classical rhetoric ''succeeded in large part in developing a method which, when well taught, could help students to write and speak effectively.''\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterargument against the author''s position, using reasoning based on modern educational trends and technological advancements.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must critically engage with the text''s arguments while incorporating logical reasoning about the relevance of classical rhetoric in today''s educational landscape.'

    The present order of the chapters does not have to be the order followed in
    the classroom. In one sense, the order observed here is a natural one: we first
    must find something to say, then organize our material, and then put it into
    words. However, long before the student reads his way through the second
    chapter, he will be writing themes, an activity that involves all three proc-
    esses. He must know something about all three processes when he sits down
    to write, but he cannot be instructed in all three at once. Every teacher makes
    his own adjustment to this fact. Since style is the most teachable of the skills
    involved in composition, some teachers will find it more convenient to start
    with Chapter IV. Others may prefer to begin with the chapter on arrange-
    ment.

    Some explanation should be offered for the heavy emphasis on argumenta-
    tive discourse. The bias is partly historical; rhetoric, throughout the ages,
    was primarily concerned with the means of argument. But a more important
    reason for concentrating on it in this text is that argumentative discourse is
    the form of rhetoric that students will be most exposed to in their lives. And
    they will exercise their power of argumentative discourse, more than any
    other, if they speak or write formally at all. However, only a few of the
    rhetorical principles presented in this book are peculiar to persuasive prose.
    Most of the principles of invention, arrangement, and style are equally ap-
    plicable to exposition, description, and narration.

    Because the bulk of this book is taken up with instruction in the prin-
    ciples of rhetoric, only a limited number of readings could be provided.
    Hopefully, by the time the student has worked his way through them, he
    will be able to apply the rhetorical principles he has learned to any reading
    matter available to him. He will begin to see classical rhetoric operating
    in any prose he hears or reads, whether it be an editorial or a letter-to-the-
    editor in the local newspaper, a clever advertisement in a current magazine,
    a campaign speech, a television commercial, a "begging letter" that comes in
    the morning mail, or a classmate's impassioned plea in the student council.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Processes**\n\nUsing the text''s explanation of the three processes involved in writing (knowing, organizing, and expressing), design a step-by-step plan for analyzing a persuasive essay.\n- **Step 1**: Determine the writer''s purpose and audience based on the introduction.\n- **Step 2**: Identify the structure of the essay by examining transitions and topic sentences.\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate the effectiveness of the conclusion by comparing it to the introduction.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference all three processes and demonstrate how they interrelate in the writing process.\n\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Principles**\n\nAnalyze the excerpt from the text that discusses the emphasis on argumentative discourse.\n- **Part A**: Explain why argumentative discourse is prioritized in the text according to the author''s explanation.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the use of rhetorical principles in argumentative writing with their application in other forms of prose (exposition, description, narration).\n- **Part C**: Provide an example from everyday life (e.g., a newspaper editorial, an advertisement, or a speech) where these principles are applied.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the author''s reasoning and apply it to a real-world scenario.\n\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Elements**\n\nConsider the statement: "Only a few of the rhetorical principles presented in this book are peculiar to persuasive prose."\n- **Part A**: Explain how the text''s explanation of invention, arrangement, and style supports this claim.\n- **Part B**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the idea that these principles are exclusive to argumentative discourse. Your example must reference at least two of the three elements mentioned in the text.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the author''s emphasis on classical rhetoric is relevant to modern communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s arguments and demonstrate an understanding of the broader implications of rhetorical principles in contemporary contexts.'

    CLASSICAL RHETORIC FOR THE MODERN STUDENT

    I fear, however, that I may be regarded as setting too lofty an ideal for the
    orator by insisting that he should be a good man skilled in speaking, or as
    imposing too many subjects of study on the learner....I would ask the
    skeptical to consider how great are the powers of the mind of man and how
    astonishing its capacity for carrying its desires into execution. For has not
    man succeeded in crossing the high seas, in learning the number and the
    courses of the stars, and almost measuring the universe itself—all of them
    accomplishments of less importance than oratory but of far greater difficulty?

    Adlai E. Stevenson: Custodians of History

    1 The path to peace lies through thickets of conflict. And the biggest ob-
    stacle in the path, the most overwhelming danger of all, is the onrushing
    arms race. Every day it gathers momentum as the nuclear powers and others,
    large and small, enlarge their arsenals. Some of us continue to invent and
    test frightful new weapons. We feel obliged to do this for the sake of our
    separate national interests—at a time in history when the national interest of
    all nations, those with nuclear weapons and those without, demands not the
    expansion but the abolition of the power to wage war.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Analyzing Rhetorical Idealism in Quintilian''s Writings\n\nQuintilian, a classical rhetorician, argues that an orator must be both a ''good man skilled in speaking.'' Based on the text provided, explain how this ideal reflects the broader philosophical perspective of classical rhetoric.\n- **Step 1**: Interpret Quintilian''s statement in the context of his argument about the orator''s moral and intellectual qualifications.\n- **Step 2**: Compare this ideal to the quote by Samuel Johnson: ''Of all skill, part is infused by precept, and part is obtained by habit.'' How does this support or challenge Quintilian''s view?\n- **Step 3**: Justify your reasoning by referencing specific passages from the text, such as Quintilian''s concern about the orator''s moral character and Johnson''s emphasis on habit in skill acquisition.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must link the rhetorical ideal to broader philosophical concepts and demonstrate understanding of both classical and modern perspectives on skill acquisition.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Evaluating the Role of Study in Rhetoric\n\nThe text includes quotes from Quintilian and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, both of whom emphasize the importance of study in rhetoric. However, Dionysius states that ''the rules in textbooks of rhetoric cannot by themselves make expert those who are eager to dispense with study and practice.''\n- **Part A**: Explain why Dionysius might believe that rules alone are insufficient for becoming an expert rhetorician.\n- **Part B**: Use the quote by Rolfe Humphries (''It is foolish to suppose that you can teach anybody to write...'') to argue whether study and practice are essential for mastering rhetoric.\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument that reconciles the need for study with the necessity of practice, using the text''s quotes as supporting evidence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate all three quotes and demonstrate an understanding of the interplay between study, practice, and expertise in rhetoric.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Synthesizing the Evolution of Rhetoric\n\nThe text traces the development of rhetoric from classical times through various historical periods. Using the information provided, explain how the role and purpose of rhetoric have evolved over time.\n- **Step 1**: Identify key historical periods mentioned in the text (e.g., Middle Ages, English vernacular rhetorics of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries).\n- **Step 2**: Compare the purpose of rhetoric in classical times with its role in later periods, such as the English rhetorics of the eighteenth century.\n- **Step 3**: Use specific examples from the text, such as Quintilian''s ideal of the ''good man skilled in speaking'' and the conclusion that rhetoric is essential for all citizens.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the historical development of rhetoric and its changing significance in different eras.'

    2 Let me be as clear and simple as I can: this prodigal arms race is dangerous and deadly folly. Here in the United States we want to save, not destroy our fellow man. We want to devote the resources now swallowed up by this insatiable monster to the unfinished tasks of our own society. And we want to devote these resources to giving every soul on this earth a chance for a better life.

    3 Yet the arms race goes on. It goes on because no nation, confronted by hostile nations, can neglect its defenses. No great power can risk unilateral disarmament. There is one way—and one way only—out of this intolerable dilemma; that is a system of complete and general disarmament under which all nations progressively tear down—in plain view of the international community and with suitable safeguards—their own capacity to wage war.

    4 A great achievement of our last session was to endorse an agreement on a set of principles for general and complete disarmament in a peaceful world.

    From a speech delivered to the General Session of the United Nations, New York City, September 20, 1962. Reprinted from Vital Speeches of the Day, October 15, 1962, by permission of the publisher.

    4 INTRODUCTION

    But while we have made some progress, we have not made enough progress toward translating these agreed principles into an agreed plan—to move by mutual actions in rapid stages toward total disarmament and effective international peace-keeping.

    5 The United States has proposed such a plan. It has submitted its proposals to this Assembly and to the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Conference at Geneva.

    6 But, just as it takes at least two to make an arms race, it takes at least two to stop an arms race. No one in his senses would expect one side to abandon the means of self-defense unless it knew for sure that the other side was giving up its arms as well. This means that practical verification is the essence of any workable agreement on general disarmament.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Arms Race Logic**\n\nGiven the context of the arms race and the need for mutual verification in disarmament, explain how the text''s argument that ''no one in his senses would expect one side to abandon defenses unless the other side is also giving up arms'' logically leads to the conclusion that ''a system of complete and general disarmament under which all nations progressively tear down their capacity to wage war'' is the only viable solution.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the core problem with unilateral disarmament as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Use the text''s reasoning to explain why mutual verification is essential.\n- **Step 3**: Link the necessity of ''tearing down capacity to wage war in plain view'' to the idea of trust and verification in disarmament agreements.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly demonstrate logical reasoning based on the text''s arguments about arms race dynamics and verification.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Disarmament Principles**\n\nThe United States has proposed a plan for mutual disarmament, but the text emphasizes that ''it takes at least two to stop an arms race.'' Using the principles from the text, design a hypothetical scenario where two nations could successfully negotiate and implement this plan.\n- **Part A**: Describe the scenario, including the initial conditions (e.g., both nations have nuclear arsenals).\n- **Part B**: Outline the steps they would take to implement the plan, referencing the text''s emphasis on ''practical verification.''\n- **Part C**: Explain how this scenario exemplifies the text''s argument that ''a system of complete and general disarmament... is the only viable solution.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s concepts of mutual verification and collective action in disarmament.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Disarmament Ethics**\n\nThe text contrasts the ''insatiable monster'' of the arms race with the goal of ''giving every soul on this earth a chance for a better life.'' Using the text''s ethical stance, argue whether the pursuit of disarmament is a moral imperative or a political strategy.\n- **Part A**: Define the ethical justification for disarmament as presented in the text.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the potential consequences of failing to achieve disarmament, referencing the text''s warning about ''the unfinished tasks of our own society.''\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterargument that might challenge the text''s ethical stance and refute it using the text''s own reasoning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a deep understanding of the text''s ethical framework and its implications for international relations.'

    7 It need not be total verification. We have demonstrated again and again
    during long negotiations that we are prepared to take certain risks to lessen
    the chance of an intensified arms race. But we are not prepared to risk our
    survival. If other nations permit—as we have agreed to do—the degree of
    international inspection technically required for mutual security, we can end
    the arms race. But we cannot stake our national existence on blind trust—
    especially on blind trust in a great and powerful nation which repeatedly
    declares its fundamental hostility to the basic values of our free society.

    8 The issue is plain. The price of general disarmament is mutual security
    within the framework of the United Nations. Because such security would
    be by international inspection, it could have no conceivable connection with
    espionage. Is inspection by a United Nations agency too high a price to pay
    for the safety, perhaps survival, of mankind? Can any society value its secrecy
    more than everyone's safety—especially a society which avows itself the
    model toward which all other societies must irresistibly evolve?

    9 Mr. President, I put this issue in all gravity. I ask the members of this
    Assembly to join the peoples of the world in demanding a program of gen-
    eral disarmament which stands a chance of ending the arms race.

    10 Once again, the answer to this issue is not to be found in exhortation or
    emotionalism. It is not to be found by passing virtuous resolutions which
    proclaim noble ends without realistic means. It is to be found only in re-
    morseless effort to solve the infinitely complicated problems of disarmament.
    We believe that serious negotiations in Geneva will bring us closer to our
    goal, and I hope the discussions there will continue to have the prayerful and
    wholehearted support of this Assembly.

    11 Here in New York, the Assembly can insist on the indispensable condi-
    tion of world disarmament: assurance that agreements made are agreements
    kept.

    12 But there is a situation even more immediate and more hopeful than
    general disarmament. I refer to the testing of nuclear weapons. If we see in
    this a more acute problem, let me suggest that it is also more manageable—
    and therefore offers brighter hopes for early progress.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical Argument Structure**\n\nExplain the rhetorical structure of President Kennedy''s speech as it relates to the concept of ''general disarmament.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the three main rhetorical strategies used by Kennedy in his argument (e.g., ethos, pathos, logos).\n- **Step 2**: For each strategy, provide a specific example from the text and explain how it supports his main claim.\n- **Step 3**: Compare the effectiveness of these strategies in persuading the Assembly to support disarmament.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s content with classical rhetorical principles and demonstrate a clear understanding of Kennedy''s argumentative methods.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Ethical and Logical Reasoning**\n\nEvaluate the logical structure of President Kennedy''s argument regarding nuclear weapon testing.\n- **Part A**: Identify two logical fallacies that Kennedy might be avoiding in his speech.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the text emphasizes ''mutual security'' as a prerequisite for disarmament.\n- **Part C**: Compare the ''prayerful and wholehearted support'' mentioned in the text to the ethical responsibility of a leader.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of logical reasoning, ethical responsibility, and the implications of disarmament as presented in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Rhetorical Devices**\n\nDesign a rhetorical argument that parallels Kennedy''s speech on nuclear disarmament.\n- **Step 1**: Choose a modern issue that mirrors the themes of disarmament and arms control.\n- **Step 2**: Apply at least two rhetorical strategies from Kennedy''s speech (e.g., ethos, pathos, logos) to your argument.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the structure of your argument reflects the logical and ethical reasoning presented in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate original thinking while adhering to the rhetorical principles and logical structure of Kennedy''s speech.'

    13 For nearly four years the nuclear powers, including my country, have
    been locked in negotiation for a reliable and permanent ban on the testing
    of nuclear weapons. From such a ban would come a barrier to the spread of
    such weapons; and there would come an end to this new source of radiation
    in the human environment; and a great step toward the comprehensive dis-
    armament treaty we so earnestly seek.

    14 As is plain from the draft treaties tabled in Geneva, the United States
    Government is prepared to stop the testing of all nuclear weapons, provided
    only that others are prepared to assume the obligation to do the same. Test-
    ing in the atmosphere, in the oceans and in space causes radiation. Testing
    underground does not. We are prepared to stop testing even without any
    international verification in the atmosphere, in the oceans and in space, be-
    cause we have national means of detecting testing by others. And we are
    prepared to stop testing underground—where we don't have our own means
    of verification—provided an international system is created to assure that
    others are doing the same.

    15 It may be interesting to you to know that since 1945, when it began,
    the United States has exploded nuclear devices with a total yield of about
    140 megatons.

    16 Since 1949, when it began, the USSR, so far as we can tell by distant
    instrumentation, has exploded devices with a total yield of about 250 mega-
    tons.

    17 Since the USSR broke the moratorium last fall, its explosions have
    yielded 200 megatons—those which the United States was then compelled to
    undertake, only 25 megatons.

    18 I repeat, we want to cease testing nuclear weapons. If other nuclear
    powers are also willing to make an agreement to cease, the testing will cease.
    But let there be no doubt about it—the United States prefers a comprehensive
    treaty banning all tests in all environments for all time. On this transcendent
    issue, we in the United States are in dead earnest. And I conclude with the
    thanks of my government to the eight non-aligned nations for their helpful

    This excerpt from a speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations
    exemplifies the kind of discourse with which classical rhetoric was concerned
    —the use of words to persuade someone of something. Mr. Stevenson is here
    6 INTRODUCTION

    using spoken words to effect his purpose. The "someone" he has to persuade
    is the convention of delegates from more than a hundred nations of the
    world. What he has to persuade this audience to do is to adopt a certain
    course of action during this session of the General Assembly.

    The broadest definition of the kind of rhetoric displayed here might be
    phrased this way: the art by which a discourse is adapted to its end. Marie
    Hochmuth Nichols sharpens that definition somewhat when she says that
    rhetoric is "a means of so ordering discourse as to produce an effect on the
    listener or reader." Kenneth Burke gets closer to describing the particular
    kind of verbal activity in which Mr. Stevenson is engaged when he defines
    rhetoric as "the use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation
    in beings that by nature respond to symbols." Aristotle's definition of rhetoric
    focuses most sharply on the specific kind of verbal activity in which Mr.
    Stevenson is engaged: "the faculty of discovering all the available means of
    persuasion in any given situation." |

    Although this text will be primarily concerned, as was classical rhetoric,
    with persuasive discourse, most of its precepts will be applicable to other
    forms of discourse as well. So any of the definitions presented in the previous
    paragraph would fit the art of effective writing or speaking that will be dis-
    cussed in this book. Whether we are seeking, as George Campbell put it,
    "to enlighten the understanding, to please the imagination, to move the
    passions, or to influence the will," we must adopt those strategies that will
    best achieve our end.

    Let us look at this excerpt from Mr. Stevenson's speech to see what its pur-
    pose is and how that purpose or end is achieved.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Purpose and Structure**\n\nAnalyze Mr. Stevenson''s speech in the excerpt to determine its primary purpose and how he achieves this purpose using rhetorical strategies.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the main goal of the speech based on the context provided (e.g., persuading delegates to adopt a course of action).\n- **Step 2**: Examine the structure of the speech to determine how it is organized to achieve this goal.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your analysis by referencing the definitions of rhetoric provided in the text (e.g., ''the art by which a discourse is adapted to its end'').\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly connect the speech''s structure to its rhetorical purpose and reference at least two definitions from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Definitions**\n\nUsing the definitions of rhetoric provided in the text, explain how Mr. Stevenson''s speech exemplifies each of the following:\n- **Aristotle''s definition**: ''the faculty of discovering all the available means of persuasion in any given situation.''\n- **Burke''s definition**: ''the use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols.''\n- **Burke''s definition**: ''the use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols.''\n\n**Task**: For each definition, provide a specific example from the speech and explain how it aligns with the definition.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly demonstrate an understanding of each rhetorical definition and apply it to elements of the speech.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Strategies**\n\nConsider the broader definition of rhetoric as ''the art by which a discourse is adapted to its end.''

    The general object of Mr. Stevenson's speech is "to influence the will" of
    his audience. Hence he is engaged in persuasive discourse. What strategies
    does he employ to achieve this end? To answer that question adequately, we
    would have to study the entire speech. The excerpt reproduced here repre-
    sents only about one-fifth of the speech, and any final judgment of the effec-
    tiveness of the speech would have to be made on the basis of the whole
    speech. But in this brief selection, we can observe, on a small scale, how
    means are adapted to an end.

    One of the ways in which we can persuade others is to appeal to their
    reason. In appealing to reason, we can either present a series of facts and
    make some generalization from those facts or make statements and draw
    inferences from those statements. In the first instance, we would be arguing
    inductively; in the second instance, we would be arguing deductively. With
    either method, the effectiveness of our persuasion will depend largely on the
    "truth" of what we say and the "validity" of our reasoning. When we reason
    validly from incontrovertible facts or statements, we compel assent; we con-
    vince an audience. When the premises of our argument are only probable,
    we can only induce belief; we persuade an audience. Traditionally, reasoning
    from universal truths has been the province of logic; reasoning from proba-
    bilities has been the province of rhetoric.

    In trying to get the Assembly to adopt a certain course of action, Mr.
    Stevenson is talking about the future. The future of human affairs, being
    contingent, is always attended with uncertainties. And because of the un-
    certainty about the effects of many human actions, the best that an advocate
    of some course of action can do is to make it appear likely that particular
    results will follow from the action in question. Therefore, Mr. Stevenson is
    clearly operating within the province of rhetoric. The Greek word for rhe-
    torical proofs was pisteis, a word that has its roots in the verb meaning "to
    believe." Mr. Stevenson must make his audience believe that the course of
    action he is proposing is the best course of action.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Persuasive Strategies in Rhetorical Argumentation**\n\nMr. Stevenson''s speech aims to influence the will of his audience through persuasive discourse. Based on the text, identify and explain three distinct strategies he employs to achieve this end.\n- **Strategy 1**: Use of inductive reasoning by presenting facts to support a generalization.\n- **Strategy 2**: Use of deductive reasoning by drawing inferences from statements to convince the audience.\n- **Strategy 3**: Appeal to the emotional or logical belief of the audience by framing the proposal as the "best course of action."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference terms from the text (e.g., "rhetoric," "pisteis,") and demonstrate an understanding of how these strategies align with the purpose of persuasive discourse.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Differentiation Between Inductive and Deductive Reasoning**\n\nThe text distinguishes between inductive and deductive reasoning as methods of persuasion. Compare and contrast these two approaches based on the text:\n- **Inductive Reasoning**: Involves presenting facts and generalizing from them.\n- **Deductive Reasoning**: Involves making statements and drawing inferences from them.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain how inductive reasoning is used to persuade an audience by inducing belief.\n- **Part B**: Explain how deductive reasoning is used to persuade an audience by compelling assent.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the traditional association of inductive reasoning with logic and deductive reasoning with rhetoric, as mentioned in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate definitions from the text and provide examples of how each reasoning method contributes to persuasion.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Rhetorical Proofs and Persuasive Effectiveness**\n\nThe text states that Mr. Stevenson operates within the province of rhetoric because he is trying to make his audience believe in a particular course of action. Based on the text, answer the following questions:\n- **Part A**: Explain why Mr. Stevenson''s approach is considered rhetorical rather than logical, despite his focus on the future and probabilities.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the significance of the term "pisteis" (from the Greek word for rhetorical proofs) in understanding Mr. Stevenson''s speech.\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument that demonstrates how the uncertainty of future events makes rhetoric a more appropriate method for persuasion than logic in this context.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference the text''s discussion of "rhetoric" and "pisteis," and show how these concepts apply to the analysis of Mr. Stevenson''s speech.'

Please extract all content verbatim and fix all formatting errors.\n\nIn the first three paragraphs of the excerpt, Mr. Stevenson is establishing\nthe issue of this section of his speech. He moves toward a definition of the\nissue by making a series of related assertions, the truth of which is for some\nself-evident, for others only probable. He begins in this fashion:\n\nThere are many obstacles to peace.\n\nThe most formidable obstacle to peace is the arms race.\n\nThe arms race is a deadly and dangerous course of action.\n\nBut the arms race goes on.\n\nThe arms race goes on because no nation can neglect its defenses.\nFaced with this dilemma, what do we do?\n\nAWRY PM\n\nMr. Stevenson makes no attempt to argue the truth of any of his statements\nor propositions. Knowing his audience as he does, he presumes general agree-\nment about the truth of his assertions. There are some hidden assumptions\nhere too: peace is a good thing; what is deadly and dangerous is a bad\nthing; if the bad thing is an obstacle to the good thing, the obstacle must be\nremoved. Mr. Stevenson presumes general agreement about these assump-\ntions too.\n\nAlthough Mr. Stevenson is not pausing to demonstrate the truth of any\nof these propositions, he is arguing here. There are logical links between the\nstatements; each successive statement seems to \"grow out of\" the previous\none. The logical link between the propositions is perhaps most apparent in\n(5), where we detect an abbreviated syllogism—what logicians call an en-\nthymeme. The full argument implicit in this proposition would run some-\nthing like this:\n\nNo nation can afford to neglect its defenses.\nHalting the arms race would represent a neglect of defenses.\nTherefore, no nation can afford to halt the arms race.\n  \n8 INTRODUCTION\n\nIn other words, Mr. Stevenson is trying to persuade his audience that there\nis a cause-and-effect relationship between the threats to national security and\nthe growth of the arms race.\n\nThe issue is clearly defined now: a serious threat to the peace of the world\nexists, and the members of the Assembly must find a way to remove the\nthreat without jeopardizing national security. Mr. Stevenson proposes two\nsolutions: (1) ultimately, general and complete disarmament; (2) immedi-\nately, banning of nuclear testing in the atmosphere.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical Reasoning in Argumentation**\n\nMr. Stevenson''s argument is structured as a series of logically linked statements, with the final conclusion being that the arms race must continue. Using the text provided, trace the logical progression from his initial assertions to the final conclusion.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the premise that states ''the arms race goes on'' and its supporting reason.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze the logical connection between ''no nation can neglect its defenses'' and the conclusion that ''the arms race must continue''.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how the implicit syllogism (enthymeme) in the text supports this conclusion.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate understanding of the logical structure, including the role of implicit assumptions and the use of syllogistic reasoning.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Devices in Persuasion**\n\nMr. Stevenson''s speech employs a rhetorical strategy to persuade his audience. Based on the text, explain how he uses logical progression and implicit assumptions to build a compelling case for his position.\n- **Part A**: Identify the key assumption that links ''the arms race is dangerous'' to ''it must continue''.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the implicit syllogism in the text (enthymeme) functions as a rhetorical device.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the effect of Stevenson''s approach on the audience''s perception of the issue.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must connect the rhetorical strategies to the logical structure, showing how they contribute to the effectiveness of his argument.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Rhetorical Assumptions**\n\nExamine the text and analyze the assumptions Mr. Stevenson presumes about his audience. Based on the passage, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: What is the implicit assumption about the audience''s values regarding peace and security?\n- **Part B**: How does Stevenson use the logical structure of his argument to reinforce this assumption?\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterargument that challenges the validity of his implicit assumptions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of rhetorical assumptions and their role in persuasion, as well as the ability to critically evaluate the argument''s structure.'

    Now, in order to win acceptance for his proposed solutions, he must per-
    suade his audience that his proposals are practical and practicable. In arguing
    the possible, he urges a number of points that he hopes will persuade the
    delegates that his plan can work:

    1. The last session of the Assembly agreed on a set of principles for
    disarmament.

    2. A plan to implement these principles is even now being consid-
    ered by the Disarmament Conference at Geneva.

    3. The key to the workability of any disarmament plan is a system
    of international inspection.

    4. Total verification of disarmament is desirable but not absolutely
    necessary for the success of an inspection plan.

    5. The United States, one of the key nations in the arms struggle,
    has repeatedly expressed its willingness to stop the arms race and
    to submit to international inspection.

    Mr. Stevenson concludes his section of his speech by quoting some awe-
    some figures about the amount of yield from the explosion of nuclear devices
    since 1945. He quotes these figures for two purposes. He wants to remind
    the delegates, first of all, of the dangers of radiation from continued testing
    of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. And secondly, he wants to make the
    delegates aware that Russia, the chief opponent to international inspection,
    has done more to pollute the atmosphere than the United States has.

    We have been reviewing the general course of Mr. Stevenson's arguments.
    Where did Mr. Stevenson get the matter for his arguments? Most of the
    matter was implicit in the case he was arguing. How did he discover that
    matter? How does the student discover the arguments latent in the case he
    is discussing? ‘The classical rhetoricians devised the system of topics to aid
    the process of discovering or inventing arguments in any given case.

    These topics will be explored in great detail in the next chapter. After the
    student has studied that chapter, he should be able to return to this speech
    and detect the operation of such topics as Cause and Effect and the Possible
    (the two topics we have already noted), Contraries (we want to save our

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Identification of Rhetorical Topics in Stevenson''s Speech**\n\nExplain how the rhetorical topic of ''Cause and Effect'' is used in Mr. Stevenson''s argument about disarmament.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two specific instances in the speech where cause and effect are linked.\n- **Step 2**: For each instance, explain the causal relationship and how it supports Stevenson''s argument.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the use of this rhetorical topic strengthens his overall case for international inspection.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate understanding of the ''Cause and Effect'' topic as described in the text, with specific references to the speech content.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Latent Arguments in a Speech**\n\nThe text states that ''most of the matter'' in Stevenson''s arguments was implicit in the case he was arguing. Explain how a student might discover these latent arguments using the ''topics'' devised by classical rhetoricians.\n- **Step 1**: Describe one specific topic from the classical system (e.g., Cause and Effect, Contraries) that could be used to analyze Stevenson''s speech.\n- **Step 2**: Apply this topic to the speech, identifying at least two points where it is used.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this process of discovery reflects the method described in the text for ''inventing arguments'' in any given case.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concept of ''topics'' as outlined in the text, with clear application to the speech content.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Strategies in Disarmament Debate**\n\nMr. Stevenson uses both ''the Possible'' and ''Contraries'' as rhetorical topics in his argument. Synthesize how these two topics work together to present a compelling case for international inspection.\n- **Step 1**: Explain the role of ''the Possible'' in Stevenson''s argument, referencing the specific points he uses.\n- **Step 2**: Describe how ''Contraries'' are used to address potential counterarguments.\n- **Step 3**: Analyze how the combination of these two topics creates a balanced and persuasive argument for disarmament.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both ''the Possible'' and ''Contraries'' as discussed in the text, with explicit connections to Stevenson''s speech.'

    Fellow men, yet we are engaged in a program to destroy them), Antecedents and Consequents (if we want disarmament, we must agree on a system of verification), and Degree ("Can any society value its secrecy more than everyone's safety?").

    The student will also be made aware that there are other modes of appeal besides the appeal to reason that we reviewed here. He will see, for instance, that in seeking to persuade others we sometimes make appeals to their emotions. And he will see the powerful effect exerted by the ethical appeal—the persuasive value of the speaker or writer's moral character, good sense, and good will, as those qualities are exhibited in the discourse itself.

    In the third chapter, the student will be instructed in the principles governing the arrangement of arguments once they have been discovered. Then he should be able to come back to this selection and judge whether Mr. Stevenson organized his arguments in the most effective order. He should be able to decide, for instance, why Mr. Stevenson chose to treat the proposal for total disarmament before he discussed the proposal for banning nuclear testing.

    The fourth chapter will deal with style and the contribution that style can make to effective discourse. Clarity and vivacity of style not only facilitate communication with our audience but can also enhance the persuasive value of our discourse by delivering our arguments more forcefully and by helping to establish our ethical appeal. Although Mr. Stevenson's speech has a great deal of stylistic merit, we would probably have to discount the contribution that his style made on this occasion. Since most of the delegates listened to the speech in translation, the effectiveness of the prose style was probably not felt by many of them. Realizing this fact, Mr. Stevenson did not put the high finish on this speech that characterized the speeches he delivered in the 1952 and 1956 campaigns for the Presidency.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Rhetorical Structure in a Speech**\n\nExamine the order of Mr. Stevenson''s arguments regarding disarmament and nuclear testing in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the main argument he presents first (total disarmament) and the secondary argument he introduces later (banning nuclear testing).\n- **Step 2**: Justify why this sequence might be more effective in persuading an audience, using principles from the third chapter of the text.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this approach to a different arrangement of arguments and explain how the order would likely affect persuasion.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of argumentative structure and its impact on persuasion, as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluation of Stylistic Impact in a Multilingual Context**\n\nConsider the role of style in Mr. Stevenson''s speech as described in the text.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the effectiveness of his stylistic elements may have been diminished for the audience listening in translation.\n- **Part B**: Propose an alternative stylistic approach that might have enhanced the persuasive impact of his message in a multilingual setting.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the text''s emphasis on clarity and vivacity in style relates to the ethical appeal of the speaker.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate concepts from the fourth chapter on style and ethical appeal as presented in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Rhetorical Appeals**\n\nThe text mentions that persuasive arguments can be based on appeals to reason, emotion, and ethical character.\n- **Part A**: Identify two different rhetorical appeals used in Mr. Stevenson''s speech and explain how they function to persuade the audience.\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument that uses both a logical appeal and an ethical appeal, ensuring that each is clearly identified in your reasoning.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the claim that "All persuasive arguments must include an appeal to reason." Use logical reasoning to argue for or against this statement, citing examples from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate comprehensive understanding of rhetorical strategies as discussed in the text.'

- prompt: "In our final assessment of this selection or of the whole speech, we would  \nhave to keep in mind the kind of speech it was. It was a keynote speech at  \nthe opening session of the United Nations, a speech that attempts to set the  \ntone and suggest an agenda for the coming session. So if we find the argu-  \nments thinly developed here, we must remember that Mr. Stevenson is not  \nyet actively engaged in debate. In the coming debates on his proposals, we  \ncan be sure that many of the points that he merely asserts here will be sub-  \nstantiated and that the general lines of argument will be elaborated.\n\nThis selection from a modern speech shows that deliberative rhetoric plays  \nas vital a part in our world as it did in the forums of ancient Greece and  \nRome. And this kind of rhetoric is being exercised today as often in written  \nform as in the spoken medium. We are exposed to it every day of our lives  \nin printed advertisements, in editorials, in newspaper and magazine articles,  \nin promotional letters, and in many other kinds of printed copy.\n\nIO INTRODUCTION\n\nLest we think, however, that deliberative rhetoric is another of the glorious  \nproducts of our technological age, let us look at one more example of this  \nkind of persuasive effort. The example is taken from one of the world's great  \nmasterpieces, written many centuries before the art of rhetoric was even  \nformulated. It is the famous scene in Book IX of Homer's Iliad in which  \nOdysseus, Phoinix, and Ajax come to Achilles' camp and plead with him to  \nreturn to battle. Achilles has been sulking in his tent ever since Book I, when  \nAgamemnon, the leader of the Greek forces besieging the city of Troy, af-  \nfronted Achilles by taking the girl Briseus, one of his prizes of war. After  \nAchilles withdrew his troops from the front lines, the fortunes of war went  \nfrom bad to worse for the Greeks. Agamemnon's army is now desperate. The envoys must succeed in persuading Achilles to return to battle.\n\nWe will look at only the first two speeches in this scene—Odysseus' plea  \nto Achilles and Achilles' reply to Odysseus.\n\nHomer: The Envoys Plead with Achilles\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

    4 "Friend, surely to thee thy father Peleus gave commandment the day he sent thee to Agamemnon forth from Phthia: 'My son, strength shall Athene and Hera give thee if they will; but do thou refrain thy proud soul in thy breast, for gentlemindedness is the better part; and withdraw from mischievous strife, that so the Argives may honour thee the more, both young and old.' Thus the old man charged thee, but thou forgettest. Yet cease now at the last, and eschew thy grievous wrath; Agamemnon offereth thee worthy gifts, so thou wilt cease from anger.

    5 Lo now, hearken thou to me, and I will tell thee all the gifts that in his hut Agamemnon promised thee: seven tripods untouched of fire, and ten talents of gold and twenty gleaming caldrons and twelve stalwart horses, winners in the race, that have taken prizes by their speed. No lackwealth were that man, neither undowered of precious gold, whose substance were as great as the prizes Agamemnon's steeds have borne him off. And seven women will he give, skilled in excellent handiwork, Lesbians whom he chose from the spoils the day that thou thyself tookest Lesbos, surpassing womankind in beauty. These will he give thee, and with them shall be she whom erst he took from thee, even the daughter of Briseus; moreover he will swear a great oath that never he went up into her bed nor had with her converse as is the wont of mankind, O king, even of men and women.

    8 And Achilles fleet of foot answered and said unto him: "Heaven-sprung son of Laertes, Odysseus of many wiles, in openness must I now declare unto you my saying, even as I am minded and as the fulfilment thereof shall be, that ye may not sit before me and coax this way and that. For hateful to me even as the gates of hell is he that hideth one thing in his heart and uttereth another: but I will speak what meseemeth best. Not me, I ween, shall Aga-memnon son of Atreus persuade, nor the other Danaans, seeing we were to have no thank for battling with the foemen ever without respite. He that abideth at home hath equal share with him that fighteth his best, and in like honour are held both the coward and the brave; death cometh alike to the untoiling and to him that hath toiled long. Neither have I any profit for that I endured tribulation of soul, ever staking my life in fight. Even as a hen bringeth her unfledged chickens each morsel as she winneth it, and with herself it goeth hard, even so I was wont to watch out many a sleepless night and pass through many bloody days of battle, warring with folk for their women's sake.

    g "Twelve cities of men have I laid waste from ship-board, and from land eleven, I do you to wit, throughout deep-soiled Troy-land; out of all these took I many goodly treasures and would bring and give them all to Aga-memnon son of Atreus, and he staying behind amid the fleet ships would take them and portion out some few but keep the most. Now some he gave to be meeds of honour to the princes and the kings, and theirs are left un-touched; only from me of all the Achaians took he my darling lady and keepeth her—let him sleep beside her and take his joy!

    10 "But why must the Argives make war on the Trojans? why hath Atreides gathered his host and led them hither? is it not for lovely-haired Helen's sake?

But now that he hath taken my meed of honour from mine arms and hath deceived me, let him not tempt me that know him full well; he shall not prevail. Nay, Odysseus, let him take counsel with thee and all the princes to ward from the ships the consuming fire.

    shall be imperishable; but if I go home to my dear native land, my high
    fame is taken from me, but my life shall endure long while, neither shall the
    issue of death soon reach me. Moreover I would counsel you all to set sail
    homeward, seeing ye shall never reach your goal of steep Ilios; of a surety
    far-seeing Zeus holdeth his hand over her and her folk are of good courage.

    even as is the office of elders, that they may devise in their hearts some other
    better counsel, such as shall save them their ships and the host of the Achaians
    amid the hollow ships: since this counsel availeth them naught that they
    have now devised, by reason of my fierce wrath. But let Phoinix now abide

    Commentary on "The Envoys Plead with Achilles"

    The situation dramatized in this scene from the Iliad is one that we see
    enacted frequently today, possibly in our own lives, certainly in public life:
    one man or a group of men trying to persuade another man to do something
    or to assent to something. Today it may be a young man begging his father
    to let him use the family car for a Saturday night date, or it may be, as it
    was in 1952, the party leader trying to convince an indifferent General Eisen-
    hower or a reluctant Governor Stevenson to run for the office of the President.
    This rather common situation calls for uncommon rhetorical powers.

    Viewed from the standpoint of narrative, this is an intensely dramatic
    scene that Homer has posed in the ninth book of his epic; viewed from the
    standpoint of rhetoric, this is a situation that will call upon all the resources
    of the men sent on this crucial mission. Agamemnon chose his ambassadors
    shrewdly: Odysseus, "the man who was never at a loss"; Ajax, reputed to
    be the mightiest Greek warrior after Achilles; Phoinix, Achilles' beloved old
    tutor. Each of them will work on the aggrieved and disgruntled Achilles in
    his own way.

    The Homeric heroes took as much pride in their skill with words as in
    their skill with arms. When Phoinix rose to plead with Achilles, he reminded
    his former pupil of how he had schooled him to be "both a speaker of words
    and a doer of deeds." And throughout the Iliad, Achilles boasts of, and his
    companions acknowledge, his skill in oratory. Odysseus knows that he is not
    as great a warrior as Achilles, but he is conscious that he is superior to
    Achilles in rhetorical prowess. In Book III of the Iliad, Antenor described
    Odysseus when he came to the Trojan court to negotiate for the return of
    Helen: "But when he uttered his great voice from his chest, and words like
    unto snowflakes of winter, then could no mortal man contend with Odysseus."
    And it was Odysseus, remember, who in Book II restrained the Greeks, by
    the power of his rhetoric, from rushing off to their ships and sailing home.
    Phoinix too is on his mettle in this scene. As Quintilian said, "The teacher
    should therefore be as distinguished for his eloquence as for his good char-
    acter, and like Phoinix in the Iliad be able to teach his pupil both how to
    behave and how to speak" (Institutio Oratoria, II, iii, 12).

    It is no wonder that rhetoricians found Homer a rich mine for quotations and illustrations, for the Iliad and the Odyssey are filled with models of almost every kind of eloquence. Quintilian remarked that the magnificent speeches in the first, second, and ninth books "display all the rules of art to be followed in forensic or deliberative oratory" (Institutio Oratoria, X, i, 47). Today we find it almost laughable to read about warriors pausing in the heat of battle, as they do in some of the scenes of the Iliad, to hurl long speeches at one another. But the tradition of oratory was already well established—if not yet well formulated—in Homer's time, and this tradition persisted and grew stronger throughout the Golden Age of Athens. So we must take the oratory displayed in this scene as seriously as the participants took it, and we must savor the relish with: which they indulged in this battle of words.

    The participants in this battle of words are clearly engaged in what the classical rhetoricians called deliberative discourse. In classifying the three kinds of oratory, Aristotle pointed out that deliberative oratory is concerned with future time; that the means used in this kind of oratory are exhortation and dissuasion; and that the special topics that figure most prominently in this kind of discourse are the expedient and the inexpedient, or the advantageous and the injurious. In other words, when we are trying to persuade a man to do something, we try to show that the recommended course of action is either a good in itself (and therefore worthy of pursuit for its own sake) or something that will benefit him. The envoys are trying to exhort Achilles to undertake an action in the future (on the morrow, if he will) that will be advantageous both to himself and to the Greeks. Achilles is engaged in refuting the exhortations.

    Our selection from this scene reproduces only Odysseus' plea to Achilles and Achilles' reply to Odysseus. Let us look at the strategies of argument in these two speeches.

    We have already remarked that Odysseus was reputed to be the most ac-
    complished speaker among the Greeks. And indeed his speech here is a

    model, in miniature, of the well-organized oration. It has an exordium, a
    16 INTRODUCTION

    narration, a proof, and a peroration. None of these parts is developed to the
    extent that it would be in a full-fledged deliberative oration, but the speech
    does conform to the standard dispositio or arrangement laid down by the
    teachers of rhetoric.

    Odysseus begins his speech by offering a toast to Achilles. Here he is doing
    what is often done in the exordium or introduction to a discourse: attempting
    to ingratiate himself with his audience, to conciliate his audience that is in-
    different or reluctant or hostile (whichever term best describes Achilles'
    mood at the moment). All the rhetoricians emphasize the importance of
    putting the audience in a receptive frame of mind, especially if the audience
    is suspicious or hostile. The need to dispose an audience favorably explains
    why so many speakers begin their talk with a joke or a humorous anecdote.

    Odysseus then proceeds to the narratio, or the exposition of the state of affairs at the moment (paragraphs 2 and 3). He describes for Achilles the desperate straits in which the Greeks now find themselves. In doing this, he employs the device of enargeta, which, as Quintilian puts it, "makes us seem not so much to narrate as to exhibit the actual scene, while our emotions will be no less actively stirred than if we were present at the actual occurrence" (Institutio Oratoria, VI, ii, 32). Thus Odysseus pictures for Achilles the countless watch-fires burning in the Trojan bivouac outside the line of the Greek ships; the favorable omen given by Zeus's lightning; and the "devouring flame" that threatens to engulf the ships. All these fire images are subtly calculated to arouse Achilles' anger, since to the Greek mind fire was intimately associated with the emotion of anger. By picturing Hector in his frenzied, arrogant, triumphant assault on the ships, Odysseus seeks to touch Achilles' pride and envy. He is needling Achilles. Are you going to let Hector make good his boast that he will chop down our ensigns and smother our ships with fire and smoke? If an appeal like this does not touch Achilles' pride, perhaps it will touch his sense of loyalty and patriotism.

    Odysseus then launches into that part of his speech that the Latin rhetoricians called the confirmatio—the proof of one's case. It is in this section that the speaker brings to bear "all the available means of persuasion" to support the cause he is espousing.

    Odysseus first tries to influence Achilles by reminding him of his father Peleus' warning that he should restrain his proud temper and avoid quarrels. Not only is restraint of temper a good in itself, but it disposes a man to fight more effectively, and it disposes the gods, in whose hands our fortunes rest, to look with favor on our cause. Odysseus is here appealing to filial piety. Achilles is not as distinguished for pietas as was that later epic hero Aeneas, but in a strongly patriarchal society such as existed in ancient Greece, a son would not be entirely impervious to the advice of his father. If this reminder of a forgotten warning does not prevail with Achilles, it is only because Achilles feels that there is an over-riding justification for his anger.

    After this, Odysseus catalogues for Achilles all the gifts that Agamemnon is prepared to give him if he will return to battle. Aristotle pointed out in his Rhetoric that exhortation and dissuasion turn ultimately on considerations of happiness or, more generally, the Good. Whenever we try to persuade someone to do something, we try to show him the benefits that will result from his action. Some of the goods that most men agree upon as contributing to happiness are such external goods as a respected family, loyal friends, wealth, fame, honor, and such personal excellences as health, beauty, strength. Of all these goods, Odysseus comes down heaviest on wealth. He entices Achilles with the list of all the gold, the horses, the servant women, and the property that Agamemnon will bestow on him. Not only will he yet back the girl Briseus, the object of the quarrel with Agamemnon in the first place, but he will be honored with one of Agamemnon's daughters as a bride.

    Odysseus is plainly appealing to Achilles' self-interest here. Achilles could
    not help being tempted by the king's generous offerings, for in this aristo-
    cratic society one of the marks of honor for a hero was abundant possessions.
    And, besides, these generous offerings would be a manifestation of Aga-
    memnon's humiliating capitulation to Achilles. We shall see, when we con-
    sider Achilles' rebuttal, why it is that he was able to resist the tempting offer
    of these goods.

    Odysseus did not, of course, have to invent these appeals. He is merely
    repeating, verbatim, the offer that Agamemnon had made, at the beginning
    of Book IX, before the council that immediately preceded this embassy. Odys-
    seus was using the available means of persuasion, but he didn't have to dis-
    cover these means.

    One point needs to be made, however, about this verbatim retailing of
    Agamemnon's offer. The shrewd Odysseus did leave out one part of Aga-
    memnon's council speech. At the very end Agamemnon had said: "All this
    will I accomplish so he but cease from wrath. Let him yield; Hades I ween
    is not to be softened neither overcome, and therefore is he hatefullest of all
    gods to mortals. Yea, let him be ruled by me, inasmuch as I am more royal
    and avow me to be the elder in years." Odysseus knew that if he were to
    repeat these words he would only increase Achilles' anger. For these words
    reveal that Agamemnon's capitulation is grudging and half-hearted. And
    certainly the king's insistence that he is still the superior man would have
    antagonized rather than conciliated Achilles.

    Odysseus concludes his appeal by playing a slightly different note. If
    Achilles cannot rise above his hatred of Agamemnon, let him consider the

    honor he can win for himself by destroying Hector and rescuing the Greeks.
    This is another appeal to self-interest, but it is self-interest on a higher plane
    than the previous reminder of material rewards. For the Homeric hero, per-
    sonal glory was the highest good. Odysseus has reserved the strongest appeal
    for the climax of his argument.

    Achilles' reply is immediate and impulsive. There is no reflective pause to
    weigh the arguments. One gets the impression that Achilles had given only
    half an ear to Odysseus' plea and that he has been waiting impatiently for
    Odysseus to stop speaking so that he can have his say. One is not surprised
    then to find Achilles' speech emotionally charged—and, as a consequence,
    disorganized.

    Achilles seems not so much to answer Odysseus as to express, vigorously
    and repeatedly, his scorn of Agamemnon's offer and to declare his deter-
    mination not to fight. At first he talks as though he had not listened to Odys-
    seus at all. He says he won't fight anymore because he gets no thanks or
    reward for risking his life. But Odysseus has just told him of the thanks and
    reward he will get if he returns to battle. He will get not only what he had
    before the quarrel but additional rewards in superabundance.

    As Achilles' torrent of speech tumbles on, however, it is clear that he has
    heard Odysseus. Achilles shows himself to be aware of all the details of Aga-
    memnon's offer. But he spurns the offer. He is not just holding out for a
    higher price. No, he would reject the offer even if it were infinitely greater
    than it is. Some other considerations are now influencing Achilles.

    Something has happened to Achilles while he has been brooding in his
    tent. He has been evaluating the rationale of war in general and this war in
    particular. Why have they been fighting here for ten years? To rescue
    Helen? But that is an inane cause to fight and die for. Why should hundreds
    of wives be widowed so that the king's brother can recover his wife? The
    sheer stupidity of the war and the egregious arrogance of Agamemnon in
    marshalling so many noble warriors to fight such a war magnifies the insult
    that Achilles has sustained. Does Agamemnon really think that he can com-
    pensate for all this with his paltry gifts?

    Nor has Achilles been deaf to Odysseus' plea on the grounds of personal
    honor. As we have pointed out, the prospect of winning personal glory exer-
    cised a strong attraction for the Greek heroes. But having seen this war in
    proper perspective, Achilles no longer finds the attraction of personal honor
    as potent as it once was for him. There is something more dear to him now
    than honor and wealth—life. "For not of like worth with life," he says, "hold
    I even all the wealth that men say was possessed of the well-peopled city of
    Ilios"; and a little later he says, "...if I go home to my dear native land, my
    high fame is taken from me, but my life shall endure long while, neither
    shall the issue of death soon reach me." Achilles has decided that life is a
    higher good than fame or wealth.

    In making this decision, Achilles has employed one of Aristotle's common topics—the topic of degree. When men deliberate about a course of action, the choice is not always between a good and an evil; sometimes the choice is between two or more goods. In making a choice from among several goods, men decide on the basis of degree: which of these goods is the greater good or the greatest good? And that is the topic that Achilles resorts to here. As readers of the Iliad know, Achilles later changes his mind and elects honor over life. But at the moment and in answer to Odysseus' persuasive appeals, he declares his preference for life over wealth and honor.

    This is all the argument that one can make out of Achilles' rebuttal. Most of his speech is taken up with impassioned but eloquent ranting. One thing is clear, though, at the end of his speech: he will not fight. And it appears that Odysseus, the renowned orator, the man who was never at a loss, has utterly failed to move Achilles. It is now Phoenix's turn to appeal to him, and then Ajax's. But we have not reproduced these two speeches in our selection. If the student is interested in observing the rhetorical appeals made by Phoenix and Ajax, he can read them in the ninth book of the Iliad.

    What lessons about rhetoric can the modern student learn from a study of this episode, which constitutes a dramatic scene in a narrative poem but which is presented in the form of an oratorical debate? He learns for one thing that, despite the hundreds of years that separate his society from former's, men acted and responded then in much the same way that they do today. Men still sulk because of a real or supposed affront to their dignity; other men try to salve the wounds of the insult. The dominant ideals of a society change with the passage of time—today, for instance, we put more of a premium on actions that contribute to the common welfare than on actions that contribute only to a man's personal honor—but the basic human passions and motivations are the same today as they were in Homer's day.

    In this episode, we see men arguing in much the same way as we argue
    today. What do we do when we want to change someone's attitude or get
    someone to do something? We appeal to him in much the same way that
    Odysseus, Phoinix, and Ajax appealed to Achilles. We try to show a man
    how a proposed course of action will benefit him, how it will contribute to
    his happiness. The material rewards we offer him may not be fancy tripods
    and swift race horses, but they will be similar lures—deep-freezes and Cadil-
    lacs. Or we may try to show him how much honor or power he will reap
    for himself. Or we may try to show him how foolish or how dangerous his
    failure to act will be.

    If these appeals to his understanding fail to move him, we try other ap-
    proaches. We try to induce such emotions as anger, fear, pity, shame, envy,
    contempt. Since it is the will that controls whether a man will act or not and
    since an appeal to the emotions is one of the most potent means of moving
    the will, we may find that in some circumstances the emotional appeal is the
    most effective tactic. We would hope too that the ethical appeal of our speech
    would help to influence our reluctant man. If the man perceives from our
    persuasive efforts that we are men of intelligence, good character, and good
    will, he will be disposed to listen and respond to our logical and emotional
    appeals.

    In short, what we learn from this display of rhetoric is that in similar cir-
    cumstances we employ the same strategies of appeal that the envoys did.
    We make use of "all the available means of persuasion in any given case."
    We may find and employ more arguments, we may arrange them differently,
    we may use a more temperate or a more florid style in which to convey our
    arguments; but fundamentally our strategies will be the same as those used
    by the envoys.

    It is with the strategies of discourse directed to a definite audience for a
    definite purpose that this text will be concerned.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Persuasive Strategies**\n\nIn the text, it is stated that we use ''all the available means of persuasion in any given case.'' Consider a situation where you are trying to convince someone to adopt a new eco-friendly habit.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two different types of appeals (logical, emotional, ethical) that you might use.\n- **Step 2**: For each appeal, explain how it aligns with the strategies mentioned in the text (e.g., ''This appeal corresponds to...'').\n- **Step 3**: Justify why a combination of these appeals might be more effective than relying on just one.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text''s discussion of persuasion strategies and demonstrate an understanding of how different appeals function in rhetoric.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Strategies**\n\nThe text describes how envoys used logical, emotional, and ethical appeals to persuade Achilles. Imagine you are writing a persuasive speech for a debate on climate change.\n- **Part A**: Outline the logical appeal you would make, citing a specific example from the text.\n- **Part B**: Describe an emotional appeal you might use, explaining how it connects to the text''s discussion of emotions influencing will.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the ethical appeal would be integrated into your argument, referencing the text''s emphasis on the speaker''s character.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate all three appeals as outlined in the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of their roles in persuasion.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Persuasion**\n\nThe text states that ''the will that controls whether a man will act or not'' and that emotional appeals can be the most effective tactic. Consider a scenario where you are trying to convince someone to vote in an election.\n- **Part A**: Identify two different emotional appeals you might use and explain how each relates to the text''s discussion of emotions.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast logical and emotional appeals, using examples from the text to justify your reasoning.\n- **Part C**: Construct a hypothetical situation where an ethical appeal would be more effective than either logical or emotional appeals, and explain why.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the text''s rhetorical strategies and their application in real-world persuasion scenarios.'

- prompt: "The student has just seen two examples of persuasive discourse. The analyses  \nof these two pieces introduced some terminology that may be completely  \nunfamiliar to him. The terminology is strange because it belongs to an art  \nthat was formulated many centuries ago and that ceased to be a vital disci-  \npline in our schools sometime in the nineteenth century. Although the stu-  \ndent may often have heard the term rhetoric used, he probably does not have  \na clear idea of what it means. His uncertainty is understandable, because the  \nword rhetoric has acquired many meanings. Rhetoric may be associated in  \nhis mind with the writing of compositions and themes or with style—figures  \nof speech, flowery diction, variety of sentence patterns and rhythms—or with  \nthe notion of empty, bombastic language, or rodomontade (to use a bom-  \nbastic word), of \"sound and fury, signifying nothing,\" of \"sounding brass  \nand tinkling cymbals.\" Perhaps tucked away somewhere in his consciousness  \nis the notion of rhetoric as the use of language for persuasive purposes.  \nWhat all these notions have in common is that rhetoric implies the use or  \nmanipulation of words. And, indeed, a look at the etymology of the word  \nrhetoric shows that the term is solidly rooted in the notion of \"words\" or  \n\"speech.\" The Greek words rhéma (\"a word\") and rhétor (\"a teacher of  \noratory\"), which are akin, stem ultimately from the Greek verb ero (\"I  \nsay\"). Our English noun rhetoric derives from the Greek feminine adjective  \nrhetortké, which is elliptical for rhetoriké techné (\"the art of the rhetor or  \norator\"). English got its word immediately from the French rhétorique.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nGiven the definition of rhetoric as ''the use or manipulation of words'' from the text, explain how persuasive discourse in the examples provided can be categorized as rhetoric.\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least two characteristics of persuasive discourse from the text that align with the definition of rhetoric.\n- **Step 2**: Justify why these characteristics make the examples fall under the category of rhetoric.\n- **Step 3**: Contrast this with a non-rhetorical use of language, using the text''s explanation of rhetoric to support your argument.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s etymological explanation of rhetoric and demonstrate an understanding of its core definition.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Rhetorical Terminology**\n\nThe text mentions that the term ''rhetoric'' has multiple meanings, including ''empty, bombastic language.'' Analyze the difference between a rhetorical use of language and a non-rhetorical use, using the text''s definitions.\n- **Part A**: Provide an example of a rhetorical use based on the text''s description of ''sound and fury, signifying nothing.''\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of a non-rhetorical use based on the text''s description of ''use of language for persuasive purposes.''\n- **Part C**: Explain why the text distinguishes between these two uses, referencing the etymology and definitions provided.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your examples must be original, and your explanation must integrate the text''s etymological and definitional information.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Rhetorical Principles**\n\nThe text discusses the Greek origin of rhetoric and its evolution in modern education. Create a persuasive argument for why ancient rhetoric should be reintroduced into modern curricula, using the text''s definitions and explanations.\n- **Part A**: Identify at least three benefits of studying ancient rhetoric, based on the text''s description of its purpose.\n- **Part B**: Address potential counterarguments, such as the claim that rhetoric is obsolete. Use the text''s etymology and definitions to refute this argument.\n- **Part C**: Conclude with a compelling call to action, referencing the text''s explanation of rhetoric as ''the art of the rhetor or orator.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be logically structured, and your response must directly reference the text''s content on the history and purpose of rhetoric.'

    This investigation of the etymology of the term brings us somewhat closer to the original meaning of rhetoric: something connected with speaking, orating. From its origin in fifth-century Greece through its flourishing period in Rome and its reign in the medieval trivium, rhetoric was associated primarily with the art of oratory. During the Middle Ages, the precepts of classical rhetoric began to be applied to letter writing, but it was not until the Renaissance, after the invention of printing in the fifteenth century, that the precepts governing the spoken art began to be applied, on any large scale, to written discourse. Today, curiously enough, the principles of classical rhetoric are more likely to be studied in Speech classes than in English classes: we have come full circle.

    Although the etymology of the word does not imply it, rhetoric was associated primarily with persuasive discourse, as in the examples we read at the beginning of this chapter. From its beginnings and throughout its history, classical rhetoric was thought of as the art of persuasive speech. Its end was to convince or persuade an audience to think in a certain way or to act in a certain way.

    Rhetoric as persuasive discourse is still very much exercised among us, but American students no longer receive any extensive training in the art of persuasion. Frequently, the only remnant of this training in the modern college is the attention paid to argumentation in a study of the four forms of discourse—Argumentation, Exposition, Description, and Narration. But this study of argumentation usually turns out to be just an accelerated course in logic. For the classical rhetorician, logic was an ancillary but distinct discipline. Aristotle, for instance, spoke of rhetoric as being "an offshoot" or "a counterpart" of logic. The speaker might employ logic to persuade his hearers, but logic was only one among many "available means of persuasion." So the student who studies argumentation in his Freshman English class today is not really exposed to the rich, highly systematized discipline that earlier schoolboys submitted to when they were learning the persuasive art.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Purpose and Modern Application**\n\nGiven the historical evolution of rhetoric as described in the text, what is the primary function of classical rhetoric today?\n- **Step 1**: Define the original purpose of rhetoric according to the text.\n- **Step 2**: Compare this with its modern application in educational settings (e.g., speech classes vs. English classes).\n- **Step 3**: Justify how the text''s claim that ''rhetoric is more likely to be studied in Speech classes than in English classes'' reflects a shift in its focus.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly address the text''s argument about the transformation of rhetoric''s purpose and demonstrate understanding of its historical development.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Rhetorical Discourse**\n\nBased on the text''s discussion of the four forms of discourse (Argumentation, Exposition, Description, and Narration), explain why studying argumentation in Freshman English is considered ''just an accelerated course in logic.''\n- **Step 1**: Reference the text''s claim that classical rhetoric was ''an offshoot'' of logic.\n- **Step 2**: Compare the classical view of rhetoric with contemporary educational practices.\n- **Step 3**: Use logical reasoning to explain why the modern study of argumentation lacks the ''rich, highly systematized discipline'' described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s historical perspective with its critique of modern educational approaches.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Rhetorical Training**\n\nThe text states that ''American students no longer receive any extensive training in the art of persuasion.'' Construct an argument that explains why this might be the case, using at least two pieces of evidence from the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two key historical developments mentioned in the text that contributed to this shift.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how these developments relate to changes in the educational focus on rhetoric.\n- **Step 3**: Use logical reasoning to connect these changes to the current lack of training in persuasion.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly address the text''s argument and demonstrate a deep understanding of its historical and educational context.'

- prompt: "Although classical rhetoric has largely disappeared from our schools, there  \nwas a time when it was very much alive. For extended periods during its  \ntwo-thousand-year history, the study of rhetoric was the central discipline in  \nthe schools. Rhetoric enjoyed this eminence because, during those periods,  \nskill in oratory or in written discourse was the key to preferment in the  \ncourts, the forum, and the church. One of the reasons why the study—if not  \nthe practice—of rhetoric has declined in our own times is that in an indus-  \ntrial, technological society like our own there are avenues to success other  \nthan the communication skills. It is part of the folklore of America that in  \n​22 INTRODUCTION  \n\nthe years from about 1870 to 1910 some barely literate men became million-  \naires—some of whom, happily, eventually founded libraries and endowed  \nuniversities.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Rhetorical Concepts and Historical Context\n\nIn the text, it is noted that classical rhetoric was once central to education but has declined in modern times due to the rise of industrial and technological societies.\n- **Part A**: Compare and contrast the role of rhetoric in ancient education (as described in the text) with its current relevance.\n- **Part B**: Using examples from the text, explain why the decline of rhetoric in modern education might be seen as a loss to society.\n- **Part C**: Propose one modern application of classical rhetoric that could be relevant in today''s technological society. Justify your suggestion based on the text''s discussion of communication skills as a key to success.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate historical context, the text''s arguments about rhetoric''s past and present roles, and a creative modern application that aligns with the text''s themes.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Analysis of Rhetorical Decline and Historical Precedent\n\nThe text references the period from 1870 to 1910 where some barely literate individuals became wealthy and founded libraries.\n- **Part A**: Explain how this historical example relates to the text''s argument about the decline of rhetoric in modern education.\n- **Part B**: Using logical reasoning, argue whether the decline of rhetoric is a positive or negative development in today''s society. Support your argument with two points derived from the text.\n- **Part C**: Identify one potential consequence of the decline of rhetoric in education that is not explicitly mentioned in the text but can be inferred from its themes.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate critical thinking by connecting the historical example to the text''s main argument and providing an inference based on its themes.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Evaluation of Rhetorical Skills in Modern Context\n\nThe text suggests that communication skills (a core aspect of rhetoric) are still valuable in today''s society.\n- **Part A**: List three modern professions where rhetorical skills are essential, and explain why they are important in each.\n- **Part B**: Compare the text''s view of rhetoric to a modern alternative (e.g., digital communication skills). Do you think one is more important than the other? Justify your answer based on the text''s discussion of rhetoric''s historical and contemporary roles.\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument for why the text''s emphasis on rhetoric should be reconsidered in modern education, even if communication skills are available through other means.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must show a clear understanding of the text''s arguments and demonstrate the ability to evaluate the relevance of rhetoric in today''s technological society.'

- prompt: "One fact that emerges from a study of the history of rhetoric is that there  \nis usually a resurgence of rhetoric during periods of violent social upheaval.  \nWhenever the old order is passing away and the new order is marching—or  \nstumbling—in, a loud, clear call goes up for the services of the man skilled  \nin words. One needs only to hearken back to such historical events as the  \nRenaissance in Italy, the Reformation in England, and the Revolution in  \nAmerica to find evidence of this desperate reliance, in times of change or  \ncrisis, on the talents of men skilled in the persuasive arts. As Jacob Burck-  \nhardt has pointed out in The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, the  \norator and the teacher of rhetoric played a prominent role in the fifteenth-  \ncentury humanistic movement that was casting off the yoke of the medieval  \nchurch. After Henry VIII broke with Rome, the Tudor courts resounded  \nwith the arguments of hundreds of lawyers engaged to fight litigations over  \nconfiscated monastic properties. Students of the American Revolution need  \nrecall only Tom Paine's incendiary pamphlets, Patrick Henry's rousing  \nspeeches, Thomas Jefferson's daring Declaration of Independence, and Ham-  \nilton's and Madison's efforts to sell constitutional democracy in the Federalist  \nPapers to be convinced that in time of upheaval we rely heavily on the serv-  \nices of men equipped with persuasive tongues and pens. Something of the  \nsame kind of rhetorical activity is raging today among the nationalists fight-  \ning for independence in African and Asian countries.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Historical Analysis of Rhetorical Resurgence**\n\nUsing the provided text, explain why periods of violent social upheaval historically lead to a resurgence in the use of rhetoric. Support your argument with examples from the text, such as the Renaissance in Italy, the Reformation in England, and the American Revolution.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the common theme among these historical events.\n- **Step 2**: Link this theme to the role of rhetoric in each case.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a general statement about the relationship between social change and rhetoric.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include at least two specific examples from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how rhetoric serves as a tool for societal transformation.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Evaluation of Rhetorical Roles**\n\nBased on the text, analyze the role of rhetoric in three different historical contexts: the fifteenth-century humanistic movement in Italy, the Tudor courts during the Reformation, and the American Revolution.\n- **Part A**: Describe how rhetoric was used in each context.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the functions of rhetoric in these contexts.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate whether the role of rhetoric in these periods was primarily persuasive, educational, or both.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s examples and demonstrate an ability to synthesize different applications of rhetoric in historical settings.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Modern Rhetorical Applications**\n\nThe text mentions that rhetorical activities are currently occurring among nationalists fighting for independence in African and Asian countries. Using the text, explain how this modern context is similar to historical instances of rhetoric during periods of social upheaval.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key elements of historical rhetoric during upheaval (e.g., persuasion, societal change).\n- **Step 2**: Draw parallels between these elements and the modern nationalist movements.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a reflection on the enduring relevance of rhetoric in times of change.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s examples and demonstrate an understanding of how rhetoric continues to serve as a tool for societal transformation.

- prompt: "The student who wants to learn something about the history of rhetoric  \ncan read the Survey of Rhetoric in the Appendix of this book, and he can  \nfurther pursue his interest by reading some of the primary and secondary  \ntexts on rhetoric listed in the Bibliography in the Appendix. Before getting  \ninto the study of rhetoric in the next chapter, however, the student may want  \nto gain some general knowledge of the classical system of rhetoric and its  \nterminology. By the time Cicero came to write his treatises on rhetoric, the  \nstudy of rhetoric was divided, mainly for pedagogical convenience, into five  \nparts: inventio, dispositio, elocutio, memoria, and pronuntiatio. Since this  \ntext professes to be an adaptation of classical rhetoric, the student may ap-  \npreciate an explanation of these terms and other key terms so that he might  \nbetter understand the kind of rhetoric presented in the next three chapters.\n\nTHE FIVE PARTS OF A DISCOURSE\n\nInventio is the Latin term (Aeuresis was the equivalent Greek term) for  \n\"invention\" or \"discovery.\" Theoretically, an orator could talk on any sub-  \nject, because rhetoric, as such, had no proper subject matter. In practice,  \nhowever, each speech that he undertook presented him with a unique chal-  \nlenge. He had to find arguments which would support whatever case or  \npoint of view he was espousing. According to Cicero, the speaker relied on  \nnative genius, on method or art, or on diligence to help him find appropriate  \narguments. Obviously, that man was at a great advantage who had a native,  \nintuitive sense for proper arguments. But lacking such an endowment, a  \nman could have recourse either to his dogged industry or to some system for  \nfinding arguments. Inventio was concerned with a system or method for  \nfinding arguments.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Parts and Definitions**\n\nGiven the description of the five parts of a discourse in the text, explain how each part contributes to the overall purpose of rhetoric. Use the definitions provided for inventio and other key terms from the text to construct your answer.\n- **Step 1**: Define inventio using the text''s explanation of ''invention'' or ''discovery.''\n- **Step 2**: Explain how inventio relates to the other four parts (dispositio, elocutio, memoria, pronuntiatio) in the context of creating a persuasive speech.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the classical system of rhetoric is structured this way, referencing Cicero''s influence on the division into five parts.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the definitions from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how these parts function together in rhetorical practice.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Terminology**\n\nUsing the definitions from the text, classify the following rhetorical terms into their appropriate categories: inventio, dispositio, elocutio, memoria, pronuntiatio.\n- **Term 1**: Inventio - Define it in your own words using the text''s explanation of ''invention'' or ''discovery.''\n- **Term 2**: Dispositio - Explain how it relates to the organization of a speech, based on Cicero''s description.\n- **Term 3**: Elocutio - Describe the role of this part in relation to language and style, as outlined in the text.\n- **Term 4**: Memoria - Define this term and explain its function in the preparation of a speech.\n- **Term 5**: Pronuntiatio - Explain how this final part ensures the effective delivery of a speech.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate mastery of each term''s definition and its role in the classical rhetorical system.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Structure**\n\nThe text describes the classical system of rhetoric as being divided into five parts for pedagogical convenience. Suppose a student is attempting to write a persuasive essay on the topic of climate change and wants to apply these five parts.\n- **Part A**: Using the text''s definition of inventio, explain how the student would find appropriate arguments to support their position.\n- **Part B**: Using the text''s explanation of dispositio, describe how the student would organize these arguments into a coherent structure.\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument that explains why the classical division into five parts is still relevant in modern rhetorical practice, even though the context has changed.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the definitions from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how these parts function in both classical and modern rhetorical contexts.'

    Aristotle pointed out that there were two kinds of arguments or means of persuasion available to the speaker. First of all, there were the non-artistic or non-technical means of persuasion (the Greek term was atechne pisteis). These modes of persuasion were really not part of the art of rhetoric; they came from outside the art. The orator did not have to invent these; he had merely to use them. Aristotle named five kinds of non-artistic proofs: laws, witnesses, contracts, tortures, oaths. Apparently, the lawyer pleading a case in court made most use of this kind of proof, but the politician or the panegyrist could use them too. The councilman today, for instance, who is trying to persuade the citizens to adopt a sales tax quotes statistics, legal contracts, existing laws, historical documents, and the testimony of experts to bolster his case. He does not have to invent these supporting arguments; they already exist. True, there is a sense in which he has to find such supporting arguments. He has to be aware that they exist, and he has to know what departments or records to go to in order to discover them. (One of the sections in the next chapter will provide expositions of some of the standard reference books which can supply the student with the facts, figures, testimonies to support his arguments.) But the councilman does not have to imagine these arguments, to think them up—to invent them, in the classical sense of that term.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Non-Artistic Persuasion Methods**\n\nAristotle identified five non-artistic means of persuasion: laws, witnesses, contracts, tortures, and oaths. Consider a modern political campaign where a candidate seeks to persuade voters on an issue related to public safety.\n- **Part A**: List two specific examples of how the candidate could use laws and contracts to support their argument.\n- **Part B**: Explain why ''tortures'' is an unusual term in this context and suggest a more appropriate modern equivalent.\n- **Part C**: Apply the concept of ''witnesses'' to a real-world scenario where a community is trying to pass a new environmental regulation. Describe how the candidate could use expert testimony as a form of ''witnesses'' to strengthen their case.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate Aristotle''s definitions with modern examples, demonstrating an understanding of the distinction between artistic and non-artistic persuasion methods.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Persuasion in Legal Contexts**\n\nIn the text, it is stated that a councilman using non-artistic proofs must ''be aware that they exist'' and ''know what departments or records to go to.''\n- **Part A**: Describe a scenario where a lawyer in court would use legal contracts as non-artistic proof.\n- **Part B**: Explain how oaths can be used in a courtroom setting to persuade the jury.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the role of ''witnesses'' in a political campaign with their use in a legal trial.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answers must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s distinction between non-artistic and artistic persuasion, as well as the practical application in legal and political settings.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Thinking on Persuasive Strategies**\n\nThe text distinguishes between ''inventing'' arguments (artistic persuasion) and using pre-existing evidence (non-artistic persuasion).\n- **Part A**: Argue whether the modern use of social media analytics as a persuasive tool falls under artistic or non-artistic persuasion, based on the text''s definitions.\n- **Part B**: Construct a counterargument to the claim that ''all persuasive arguments must be invented.'' Use examples from the text and modern contexts.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the concept of ''non-artistic proofs'' applies to a contemporary issue, such as climate change advocacy. Describe how activists might use existing data and testimonies without inventing new arguments to persuade the public.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a deep understanding of the text''s definitions and their application to modern rhetorical strategies.'

    The second general mode of persuasion that Aristotle spoke of included
    artistic proof—"artistic" in the sense that they fell within the province of the
    art of rhetoric: rational appeal (logos), emotional appeal (pathos), and
    ethical appeal (éthos). In exercising the rational appeal, the speaker was ap-
    pealing to his audience's reason or understanding. He is "arguing," in other
    words. When we argue, we reason either deductively or inductively—that
    is, we either draw conclusions from affirmative or negative statements (e.g.
    No man can attain perfect happiness in this life; John is a man; therefore
    John cannot attain perfect happiness in this life) or make generalizations
    after observing a number of analogous facts (e.g. Every green apple that I
    bit into had a sour taste. All green apples must be sour.) In logic, the de-
    ductive mode of arguing is commonly referred to by the term that Aristotle
    used, the syllogism. In rhetoric, the equivalent of the syllogism was the en-
    thymeme. The rhetorical equivalent of full induction in logic is the example.
    Since the next chapter will provide an elaborate explanation of syllogism,
    enthymeme, induction, and example, we will not dwell on them here.

- prompt: |-
    A second mode of persuasion is the emotional appeal. Since man is by nature a rational animal, he should be able to make decisions about his private and public life solely by the light of reason. But man is also endowed with the faculty of free will, and often enough his will is swayed more by his passions or emotions than by his reason. Aristotle expressed the wish that rhetoric could deal exclusively with rational appeals, but he was enough of a realist to recognize that man is often prompted to do something or accept something by his emotions. And if rhetoric was, as he defined it, the art of discovering "all the available means of persuasion," then he would have to give a place in his Rhetoric to an investigation of the means of touching the emotions. Accordingly, he devoted the major portion of Book II of his Rhetoric to an analysis of the more common human emotions. This was the beginning of the science of human psychology. If the orator was to play upon man's emotions, he must know what those emotions were and how they could be triggered off or subdued.

    A third mode of persuasion was the ethical appeal. This appeal stemmed from the character of the speaker, especially as that character was evinced in the speech itself. A man ingratiated himself with his audience—and thereby gained their trust and admiration—if he managed to create the impression that he was a man of intelligence, benevolence, and probity. Aristotle recognized that the ethical appeal could be the most potent of the three modes of persuasion. All of an orator's skill in convincing the intellect and moving the will of an audience could prove futile if the audience did not esteem, could not trust, the speaker. It is for this reason that politicians seeking election to public office take such great care to create the proper image of themselves in the eyes of the voters. It was for this reason also that Cicero and Quintilian stressed the need for high moral character in the speaker. Quintilian defined the ideal orator as "a good man skilled in speaking." In his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle explored the éthos proper for the individual; in his Politics, the éthos proper for individuals living together in a society.

    The method that the classical rhetoricians devised to aid the speaker in discovering matter for the three modes of appeal was the topics. Topics is the English translation of the Greek word topoi and the Latin word locus. Literally, topos or locus meant "place" or "region" (note our words topography and locale). In rhetoric, a topic was a place or store or thesaurus to which one resorted in order to find something to say on a given subject. More specifically, a topic was a general head or line of argument which suggested material from which proofs could be made. To put it another way, the topics constituted a method of probing one's subject in order to discover possible
    ways of developing that subject. Aristotle distinguished two kinds of topics: (1) the special topics (he called them idioi topoi or eidé); (2) the common topics (rhetorikotopoi). The special topics were those classes of argument appropriate to particular kinds of discourse. In other words, there were some kinds of arguments that were used exclusively in the law courts; some that were confined to the public forum; others that appeared only in ceremonial addresses. The common topics, on the other hand, were a fairly limited stock of arguments that could be used for any occasion or type of speech. Aristotle named four common topics: (1) more and less (the topic of degree); (2) the possible and the impossible; (3) past fact and future fact; (4) greatness and smallness (the topic of size as distinguished from the topic of degree). In the text itself we shall see how the topics are put to work.

    All of the considerations reviewed in the last two or three pages fell within
    the province of invention. Chapter II, entitled "Discovery of Arguments," will
    be concerned with this aspect of rhetoric—how to "discover" something to
    society ON some given subject, which is the crucial problem for most students.
    The chief reason for the student's inarticulateness on certain subjects is the
    lack of experience or reading background that can stock a student's reservoir
    of ideas. At other times, his inarticulateness stems from his inability to look
    into a subject to discover what he already knows about the subject. Since
    invention is a systematized way of turning up or generating ideas on some
    subject, the student may find this rhetorical approach helpful.

    The second part of rhetoric was dispositio (Greek, taxis), which may be
    translated as "disposition," "arrangement," "organization." This was the
    division of rhetoric concerned with the effective and orderly arrangement of
    the parts of a written or spoken discourse. Once the ideas or arguments are
    discovered there remains the problem of selecting, marshalling, and organ-
    izing them with a view to effecting the end of the discourse.

    In the simplest terms, one might say that any discourse needs a beginning,
    a middle, and an end; but this is self-evident and not much help. Rhetori-
    cians spelled out the division of a discourse more specifically and functionally.
    Aristotle held that there were really only two essential parts of a speech: the
    statement of the case and the proof of the case; but he was ready to concede
    that in practice orators added two more parts: an introduction and a con-
    clusion. Latin rhetoricians, like the author of the Ad Herennium, further
    refined these divisions, recognizing six parts: (1) the introduction (exordium); (2) the statement or exposition of the case under discussion (narratio); (3) the outline of the points or steps in the argument (divisio); (4) the proof of the case (confirmatio); (5) the refutation of the opposing arguments (confutatio); (6) the conclusion (peroratio).

    Such a division may strike the student as being arbitrary, mechanical, and

    rigid. Two things may be said in defense of this conventional pattern. It did
    set forth clear principles of organization, and inexperienced writers need
    nothing so much as simple, definite principles to guide them in arrangement
    of material. Then too the rhetoricians allowed for some adjustments in this
    scheme. Accepting the Aristotelian notion of the "available means of per-
    suasion," they acknowledge that on some occasions it was expedient to omit
    certain parts altogether (for instance, if one found it difficult to break down
    the opposing arguments, it might be advisable to omit the stage of confutatio)
    or to re-arrange some of the parts (for instance, it migh. be more effective
    to refute the opposing arguments before advancing one's own arguments).

    Unquestionably, there is a close inter-relation between inventio and dis-
    positio, and in many rhetoric books these two divisions were treated under
    one head. Disposition was looked upon as just another aspect of invention;
    inventio was the originative aspect, and dispositio was the organizing aspect.
    As the student may learn from the history of rhetoric in the Appendix, Peter
    Ramus and his followers, like Francis Bacon, wanted to relegate invention
    and disposition to the province of logic and to limit rhetoric to considerations
    of style, memory, and delivery. Chapter III of this text, entitled "Arrange-
    ment," will deal with this aspect of rhetoric.

    The third part of rhetoric was elocutio (Greek, lexis or herméneia or phrasis).
    The word elocution means something quite different to us from what it
    meant to the classical rhetorician. We associate the word with the act of
    speaking (hence, the elocution contest). This notion of speaking is, of course,
    implicit in the Latin verb from which this word stems, logui, "to speak" (cf.
    Greek, legein, "to speak"). We have a number of English words based on
    this Latin verb: loquacious, colloquial, eloquence, interlocutor. It was after
    the revival of interest in delivery in the second half of the eighteenth century
    that the word elocution began to take on its present meaning. But for the
    classical rhetorician, elocutio meant "style."

    Style is a difficult concept to define, although most of us feel we know what
    it is. Famous definitions of style, like Buffon's "style is the man," Swift's
    "proper words in proper places," Newman's "style is a thinking out into
    language," and Blair's "the peculiar manner in which a man expresses his
    conceptions," are apt, but they are just vague enough to tease us out of
    thought and just general enough to give us a sense for style without giving
    us a clear definition of it. None of the major rhetoricians attempted to give
    a definition of style, but most of them had a great deal to say about it; in
    fact, some of the Renaissance rhetorics were devoted exclusively to a con-
    sideration of style.

    One of the points that elicited a great deal of discussion was the classifi-
    cation of styles. Various terms were used to name the kinds of style, but
    there was fundamental agreement about three levels of style. There was the
    low or plain style (attenuata, subtle); the middle or forcible style (medi-
    ocris, robusta); and the high or florid style (gravis, florida). Quintilian pro-
    posed that each of these styles was suited to one of the three functions that
    he assigned to rhetoric. The plain style was most appropriate for instructing
    (docend:); the middle for moving (movendi); and the high for charming
    (delectand:).

    All rhetorical considerations of style involved some discussion of choice of
    words, usually under such heads as correctness, purity (for instance, the
    choice of native words rather than foreign words), simplicity, clearness, ap-
    propriateness, ornateness.

    Another subject of consideration was the composition or arrangement of
    words in phrases or clauses (or, to use the rhetorical term, periods). Involved
    here were discussions of correct syntax or collocation of words; patterns of
    sentences (e.g. parallelism, antithesis); proper use of conjunctions and other
    correlating devices both within the sentence and between sentences; the
    cuphony of sentences secured through the artful juxtaposition of pleasing
    vowel and consonant combinations and through the use of appropriate rhyth-
    mical patterns.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Style Classification**\n\nThe text discusses three levels of rhetorical style: low (plain), middle (forcible), and high (florid).\n- **Part A**: Explain the purpose of each style according to Quintilian''s classification. Use specific terms from the text (e.g., "instructing", "moving", "charming").\n- **Part B**: Provide a real-world example of each style. For instance, a low style might be found in educational materials; a high style could be seen in literary works. Justify why your example fits the described purpose of each style.\n- **Part C**: Analyze how the classification system reflects the societal values of its time. Relate this to the functions of rhetoric as described in the text (instruction, persuasion, ornamentation).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s terminology and demonstrate understanding of how these styles serve different rhetorical functions in communication.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Composition Principles**\n\nThe text mentions several compositional elements in rhetoric, including parallelism, antithesis, and rhythmic patterns.\n- **Part A**: Create a paragraph that demonstrates the use of parallelism and antithesis. The paragraph should be about a modern topic (e.g., technology, environmentalism) and must include at least two pairs of parallel structures and one instance of antithesis.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the use of alliteration and assonance (mentioned in the text''s discussion of "cuphony") affects the rhythm and tone of a rhetorical piece. Provide an example from your paragraph in Part A that illustrates this effect.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the use of parallelism in the text''s examples with its use in your own paragraph. Highlight how the purpose of parallelism changes based on context.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion of composition and demonstrate an ability to apply these principles creatively.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Functions**\n\nThe text describes three primary functions of rhetoric: instructing (docend), moving (movendi), and charming (delectand).\n- **Part A**: Identify three different contexts where each function would be most appropriate. For example, instructing might be used in academic writing; moving could be used in political speeches; charming might be used in poetry.\n- **Part B**: Construct a rhetorical argument that uses all three functions. The argument should address a contemporary issue (e.g., climate change, education reform) and clearly demonstrate how each function contributes to the argument''s effectiveness.\n- **Correctness**: Your argument must include at least one example of each rhetorical device mentioned in the text (e.g., parallelism, antithesis).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must show a deep understanding of the functions of rhetoric and how they can be combined to create persuasive communication.

    A great deal of attention was paid, of course, to tropes and figures (Greek, schémata, hence the English term schemes, which was often used in place of figures). Since the concept of tropes and schemes is very complex, it is better that we defer any definition and illustration of these terms to the appropriate section of the text.

    Also involved in considerations of style were arguments about (1) the functional vs. the embellishing character of style; (2) Asianism vs. Atticism; (3) the written style vs. the spoken style; (4) economy of words vs. copia of words. ‘These points of discussion are rather peripheral matters, but it is re-
    markable how much time and energy the rhetoricians devoted to such con-
    troversies. The final chapter of this book will be devoted to consideration of

    style.

    The fourth part of rhetoric was memoria (Greek, mnémé), concerned with
    the memorizing of speeches. Of all the five parts of rhetoric, memoria was
    the one that received the least attention in the rhetoric books. The reason for
    the neglect of this aspect of rhetoric is probably that not much can be said,
    in a theoretical way, about the process of memorizing; and after rhetoric
    came to be concerned mainly with written discourse, there was no further
    need to deal with memorizing. This process did receive, however, some at-
    tention in the schools of rhetoric set up by the sophists. The orator's memory
    was trained largely through constant practice (just as professional actors
    today acquire an amazing facility in memorizing a script), but the rhetors
    28 INTRODUCTION

    did suggest various mnemonic devices that facilitated the memorizing of
    speeches. The courses that one sometimes sees advertised in newspapers or
    magazines—"I Can Give You a Retentive Memory in Thirty Days"—are
    modern manifestations of this division of rhetoric. There will be no consid-
    eration in this book of this aspect of rhetoric.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nThe text discusses multiple aspects of rhetoric, including tropes and schemes, functional vs. embellishing style, Asianism vs. Atticism, written vs. spoken style, and economy of words vs. copia of words.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the distinction between functional and embellishing style relates to the debate over Asianism vs. Atticism. Use examples from the text to justify your reasoning.\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument comparing the importance of economy of words in written discourse versus copia in oral delivery. Reference at least two other rhetorical considerations mentioned in the text to support your claim.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts from the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of their interrelationships.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analytical Reasoning on Memorization Techniques**\n\nThe text describes the role of memoria in rhetoric, noting that it received less attention in theoretical works but was practiced by sophists.\n- **Part A**: Compare and contrast the memorization techniques used by sophists with those of modern actors, using direct quotes or paraphrases from the text.\n- **Part B**: Evaluate the claim that ''rhetoric is primarily concerned with written discourse'' based on the text''s discussion of memoria and its historical development.\n- **Part C**: Propose a modern mnemonic device that could be used in public speaking, drawing on the principles described in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate logical reasoning and an understanding of the text''s historical context.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Rhetorical Priorities**\n\nThe text highlights the significance of various rhetorical considerations, including style debates and memorization.\n- **Part A**: Argue that the ''functional vs. embellishing'' debate is more critical in contemporary public speaking than the ''written vs. spoken'' distinction. Support your argument with examples from the text and logical reasoning.\n- **Part B**: Reflect on why the text mentions that ''not much can be said in a theoretical way about memorizing speeches.'' How does this relate to the broader purpose of rhetoric as described in the text?\n- **Part C**: Create a hypothetical scenario where an orator must choose between using copia (abundance of words) and economy (simplicity) in a speech. Use the text''s definitions to justify your recommendation for the appropriate rhetorical strategy.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate comprehensive understanding and integration of the text''s main ideas.'

    The fifth division of rhetoric was pronuntiatio (Greek, hypokrisis) or delivery. As in the case of memoria, the theory of delivery was conspicuously neglected in the rhetoric texts until the elocutionary movement began about the middle of the eighteenth century. But most rhetoricians would acknowledge the importance of effective delivery in the persuasive process. When Demosthenes, the greatest of the Greek orators, was asked what he considered to be the most important part of rhetoric, he replied, "Delivery, delivery, delivery." Despite the neglect of delivery in the rhetoric books, a great deal of attention was devoted to this aspect in the Greek and Roman schools of rhetoric. Skill in delivery can best be acquired, of course, not by listening to theoretical discussions of this art but by actual practice and by analyzing the delivery of others. Understandably enough, discussions of delivery, as well as of memory, tended to be even more neglected in rhetoric texts after the invention of printing, when most rhetorical training was directed primarily to written discourse.

    Involved in the treatment of delivery was concern for the management of the voice and for gestures (actio). Precepts were laid down about the modulation of the voice for the proper pitch, volume, and emphasis and about pausing and phrasing. In regard to action, orators were trained in gesturing, in the proper stance and posture of the body, and in the management of the eyes and of facial expressions. What this all amounted to really was training in the art of acting, and it is significant that all the great orators in history have been great "hams."

    There is no denying the importance of delivery in effecting the end that one sets for oneself. Many speeches and sermons, however well prepared and elegantly written, have fallen on deaf ears because of inept delivery. The writer lacks the advantage a speaker enjoys because of his face-to-face contact with an audience and because of his vocal delivery; the only way in which the writer can make up for this disadvantage is by the brilliance of his style.

    THE THREE KINDS OF PERSUATIVE DISCOURSE

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Delivery Principles**\n\nGiven the text''s emphasis on delivery in rhetoric, create a step-by-step plan for effectively delivering a persuasive speech. Your plan must incorporate at least three elements from the text: (1) vocal modulation, (2) gesture management, and (3) audience engagement.\n- **Step 1**: Describe how vocal modulation should be applied to different parts of the speech (e.g., emphasis, pitch changes).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how gestures should be used to reinforce key points.\n- **Step 3**: Outline strategies for maintaining eye contact and managing facial expressions to engage the audience.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the text''s descriptions of voice modulation, gesture management, and audience engagement.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Rhetorical Neglect**\n\nThe text states that the theory of delivery was "conspicuously neglected in the rhetoric texts until the elocutionary movement began about the middle of the eighteenth century." Using this statement, construct a logical argument that explains why this neglect might have occurred. Your argument must include: (1) an explanation of the role of printing in this neglect, and (2) a comparison between written discourse and oral delivery.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the invention of printing influenced the focus of rhetorical training.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the requirements for effective written discourse versus oral delivery, citing specific examples from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must demonstrate an understanding of the historical context and the relationship between printing, rhetoric, and delivery.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Rhetorical Elements**\n\nDesign a scenario where a modern speaker would need to use all three elements of persuasive discourse (ethos, pathos, logos) as described in the text. Your scenario must include: (1) a demonstration of how each element is used, (2) an explanation of how delivery enhances the effectiveness of these elements, and (3) a conclusion that reflects on the importance of integrating delivery with persuasive techniques.\n- **Part A**: Describe a real-world situation where ethos, pathos, and logos are all necessary.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the speaker''s delivery (voice, gestures, eye contact) would support each element.\n- **Part C**: Conclude with a reflection on the text''s assertion that "delivery, delivery, delivery" is essential for persuasion.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your scenario must clearly demonstrate the integration of delivery with all three rhetorical elements as outlined in the text.'

    All rhetoricians distinguished three kinds of orations, and this tripartite classification is well-nigh exhaustive. First of all, there was deliberative oratory, also known as political, hortative, and advisory, in which one deliberated about public affairs, about anything that had to do with politics, in the Greek sense of that term—whether to go to war, whether to levy a tax, whether to enter into an alliance with a foreign power, whether to build a bridge or a reservoir or a temple. More generally, however, deliberative discourse is that in which we seek to persuade someone to do something or to accept our point of view, as in the two pieces we considered at the beginning of this chapter. According to Aristotle, political oratory was always concerned about the future (the point at issue is something that we shall or shall not do); its special topics were the expedient and the inexpedient; and its means were exhortation and dehortation.

    Secondly, there was forensic oratory, sometimes referred to as legal or judicial oratory. This was the oratory of lawyers in the courtroom, but it can be extended to cover any kind of discourse in which a person seeks to defend or condemn someone's actions. (Richard Nixon's famous "Checkers" speech before a nationwide television audience can be considered as an example of forensic rhetoric; and Newman's Apologia Pro Vita Sua is another example of forensic discourse.) Forensic oratory, according to Aristotle, was concerned with past time (court trials are always concerned with actions or crimes that took place in the past); its special topics were justice and injustice; and its means were accusation and defense.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Classification of Oratory Types**\n\nBased on the text, identify the three types of oratory discussed and explain the key characteristics of each.\n- **Deliberative Oratory**: Describe its purpose, subject matter, and rhetorical strategies as per the text.\n- **Forensic Oratory**: Explain its focus on past events, legal context, and the role of evidence in persuasion.\n- **Third Type**: According to the text, what is the third type of oratory not explicitly named but implied in the discussion? Justify your answer with reasoning from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate each oratory type using definitions and examples from the text, with a logical conclusion about the third type based on the tripartite classification.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Strategies**\n\nUsing the text''s description of deliberative and forensic oratory, design a speech that addresses a modern issue.\n- **Part A**: Choose a contemporary topic (e.g., climate change, political reform) and outline how deliberative oratory would be used to argue for action.\n- **Part B**: Create a scenario where forensic oratory would be appropriate, such as a court case or public testimony.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the two approaches, highlighting how their purposes and methods differ in terms of time frame (future vs. past) and the nature of persuasion used (exhortation vs. accusation).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s classification and apply it to real-world scenarios with clear examples.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Rhetorical Functions**\n\nThe text describes deliberative oratory as concerned with the future and forensic oratory with the past. Consider the implications of this dichotomy for modern political discourse.\n- **Part A**: How might a political leader use deliberative oratory to shape public opinion on an upcoming policy?\n- **Part B**: In what ways could forensic oratory be used in legal or public accountability situations?\n- **Part C**: The text mentions that Aristotle''s classification is ''well-nigh exhaustive.'' Based on the information provided, argue whether this classification is sufficient for understanding all types of oratory. Support your argument with reasoning from the text and logical analysis of its limitations.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s ideas with critical thinking about the applicability of Aristotle''s classification in modern contexts.

    Thirdly, there was epideictic oratory. This species has had a variety of
    other titles: demonstrative, declamatory, panegyrical, ceremonial. It is the
    oratory of display, the kind of oratory exemplified in the Gettysburg Address
    and in the old-fashioned Fourth of July speeches. In this kind of discourse,
    one is not so much concerned with persuading an audience as with pleasing
    it or inspiring it. Ceremonial discourse—the term we shall use in this text—
    is the most "literary" and usually the most ornate of the three kinds of dis-
    course. Aristotle had to strain to fit a proper time-province to this form of
    oratory, but in the interests of neatness he laid it down that ceremonial ora-
    tory was concerned primarily with the present. Its special topics were honor
    and dishonor, and its means were praise and blame. The ancients made no
    provision in their rhetorics for sermons or homiletics. But later, when rhetoric
    was studied in a Christian culture, the art of preaching was usually consid-
    ered under the head of epideictic oratory—even though preachers are also
    concerned with man's past and future actions.

    The student's doubts about the usefulness and relevance of the kind of rhetoric that will be presented in this text deserve an answer. In reply, one might say first of all that the student cannot escape rhetoric, no matter what his vocation in life is. Every day of his life, he either uses rhetoric or is exposed to it. Every half-hour that he spends in front of his television set he is subjected three or four times to somebody's efforts to get him to buy something. And he himself employs rhetoric countless times every day. Perhaps he has to convince his father to let him use the car or to induce his girlfriend to go bowling with him instead of working on her term paper or to inveigle his friend into changing shifts with him at the parking lot where they work after school. He is not aware, of course, that the announcer in the TV commercial (nor is the announcer aware probably) may have been wooing him with the common topic of degree; nor is he aware that in the debate with his father over the use of the family car he may have been using an enthymemic chain of arguments. No, he was using persuasive devices that come naturally, instinctively to human beings. Just as men immediately acknowledge the validity of the logical principle that a thing cannot at the same time be and not be, so they readily use or respond to those verbal strategies that men have always used to induce attitudes in others or to prompt others to action.

    Rhetoric, like grammar or logic or poetics, is not an a priori science. Aristotle did not sit in his cubicle and dream up a set of principles for convincing other men. Rather, he observed the practice of effective orators, analyzed their strategies, and from that observation and analysis codified a body of precepts to guide others in the exercise of the persuasive art. Aristotle believed, as did every other rhetorician who composed a treatise on the persuasive art, that what men did instinctively they could do more effectively if they consciously schooled themselves in the art of that activity. Many jazz pianists never took a lesson in their life; they just "picked it up," as they will tell you. None of these accomplished performers would deny, however, that they might improve their performance if they were to take a course in, say, harmonics at some music school.

    Rhetoric then is an inescapable activity in our lives. Of the four conventional forms of spoken or written discourse—exposition, argumentation, description, and narration—we indulge in, or are exposed to, argumentation most often. Everyone living in community with other men is a rhetorician. A mother constantly uses rhetoric on her child; a teacher, on his students; a salesman, on his clients; a foreman, on his workers. So if our student thinks that he will have no use for rhetoric when he becomes an electrical engineer, he is mistaken. If nothing else, he will have to convince his assistants to be orderly, precise, and thorough in the experiments they conduct for him.

    Grammar, logic, and rhetoric are the three arts of language. Skill in the
    language arts is more important today than it used to be. Technological im-
    provements in communication and transportation have brought us into more
    frequent and crucial converse with the inhabitants of our own country and
    with the peoples of other nations. It is important to our welfare that we learn
    how to ingratiate ourselves with others, how to express our thoughts and
    desires, how to allay their fears, and how to conciliate our differences. Rhet-
    oric can help here. With the invention of the "ultimate weapon," the hydro-
    gen bomb, science has brought us to the brink of annihilation. It behooves
    us now to withhold this means of settling the tensions that exist in the world
    and exploit the possibilities of settling those tensions by the use of the power-
    ful weapons of words. Rhetoric is the art that shows us how to hone that
    weapon and to wield it most effectively.

    Many public activities today rely heavily on the art of rhetoric. Advertis-
    ing, that vast, ubiquitous industry in twentieth-century life, is perhaps the
    best example of an activity that practices what Aristotle preached. Adver-
    tising certainly makes use of all the "available means of persuasion" to in-
    duce people to buy things, and while questions are sometimes raised about
    the ethics of advertising, there is no denying that specialists in advertising
    are remarkably effective rhetoricians.

    Many other fields of endeavor in modern life rely on rhetoric in varying
    degrees. The diplomat is a traveling rhetorician with portfolio. The public-
    relations man is a practitioner of ceremonial rhetoric, that variety which is
    so much interested in effecting persuasion as in reflecting credit on a
    person or an institution. Law is such a many-faceted profession today that
    many lawyers never get a chance to exhibit the forensic brand of rhetoric in
    the courtroom; but even those lawyers whose principal function is to prepare
    briefs for the Clarence Darrows of the courtroom can be said to be engaged
    in the invention and disposition aspects of rhetoric. Insurance men and salesmen
    (especially the door-to-door salesmen) practice deliberative rhetoric, often
    very effectively, every day. Preachers, candidates for public office, and par-
    liamentary speakers are as actively exercising their rhetorical skills today as
    they ever were.

    There are some forms of rhetoric practiced today that we regard with suspicion, and even disdain. One of these is propaganda. The term propaganda was once a neutral word, signifying the dissemination of truth. But because some men have used propaganda for unscrupulous purposes, propaganda has taken on decidedly unfavorable connotations. Closely allied to this disreputable form of rhetoric is demagoguery. The names of the most successful of the twentieth-century demagogues are etched so painfully into our memories that they need not be specified here. These were the exploiters of specious arguments, half-truths, and rank emotional appeals to gain personal advantage rather than to promote the public welfare. The newest variety of dangerous rhetoric is brainwashing. A definitive analysis of this diabolical technique has yet to be written, but a beginning has been made in the terrifying final chapters of George Orwell's 1984. A good argument for an intensive study of rhetoric is that citizens might thereby be put on their guard against the onslaughts of these vicious forms of persuasion.

    One of the chief values of rhetoric, conceived as a system of gathering, arranging, and expressing our material, is that it represents a positive approach to the problems of writing. Students have too often been inhibited in their writing by the negative approach to composition—don't do this, beware of that. Classical rhetoric too had its negative prescriptions, but, in the main, it offered positive advice to help the student in the composition of a specific kind of discourse directed to a definite audience for a particular purpose. Rhetoric cannot, of course, tell the student what he must do in any and every situation. No art can do that. But rhetoric can lay down the general principles that the student can adapt to fit the particular situation. At least it can provide the student with a set of procedures and criteria that can guide him in making strategic decisions in the composition process.

    Rhetoric was primarily a synthetic art—an art for "building up" something. But it can also be used as an analytical art—an art for "breaking down" what has been composed. As such, the study of rhetoric can make us better readers. Once we are made aware of all the artifice that goes into the composition of a discourse, we are better equipped to analyze what other speakers and writers have done to achieve their effects. As Malcolm Cowley pointed out a few years ago, the New Criticism of men like Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren represented an application of rhetorical principles to the close reading of poetic texts. Mortimer Adler's How to Read a Book, which became a surprising bestseller during the 1940's, presented a rhetorical technique for the reading of expository and argumentative prose. Wayne C. Booth, in his book The Rhetoric of Fiction (1961), has shown us how "rhetoric" operates in the short story and the novel. And in recent years, hardly an issue of the professional journals in Speech or English appears without someone's rhetorical analysis of some piece of didactic or non-didactic literature.

    The student will be amazed at the new dimensions revealed when he uses the rhetorical approach for the study of satire, to name just one of the literary genres. Satire is essentially an exercise in rhetoric—rhetoric in the classical sense of persuasive discourse. The satirist is engaged either in deliberative rhetoric or in ceremonial rhetoric: either the satirist is seeking to influence the audience, or he is seeking to celebrate a particular tradition or value.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Functions in Satire**\n\nUsing the definitions provided, identify and explain how satire employs both deliberative and ceremonial rhetoric. Provide specific examples from the text that demonstrate each type of rhetorical function.\n- **Deliberative Rhetoric**: ''The satirist is engaged ... or he is seeking to influence the audience.''\n- **Ceremonial Rhetoric**: ''The satirist is engaged ... or he is seeking to celebrate a particular tradition or value.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must reference the text''s assertion that satire is ''an exercise in rhetoric—rhetoric in the classical sense of persuasive discourse.'''
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Rhetorical Techniques in Literary Genres**\n\nExplain how the rhetorical techniques described in the text (e.g., close reading, rhetorical analysis) apply to the study of satire and other literary genres.\n- **Task A**: Compare the use of rhetoric in satire to its use in expository and argumentative prose as described by Mortimer Adler.\n- **Task B**: Discuss how Wayne C. Booth''s ''rhetoric of fiction'' relates to the analysis of satirical literature.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how rhetoric serves as a ''synthetic art'' for building up discourse and as an ''analytical art'' for breaking down composition, as stated in the text.'

    The attitude of his audience, often with the ultimate purpose of moving his audience to do something, or he is seeking, through the medium of praise or blame, to induce his audience to accept or reject some person or group of persons. Jonathan Swift's "A Modest Proposal" is a display of deliberative rhetoric. For examples of ceremonial rhetoric, we can hearken back to those devastating portraits of political and literary enemies that we get in John Iryden's "Absalom and Achitophel" or "Mac Flecknoe" or in Alexander Pope's "Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot" or "The Dunciad." Today the eighteenth-century brand of satire seems to be enjoying a revival, especially among young people of college age. Whether it is the satire in Mad Magazine or the satire of the stand-up comedians who reach their audience through television or records, all of the techniques have their roots in Aristotelian rhetoric.

    The student may fear that an elaborately systematized approach to composition will inhibit rather than facilitate writing. There is no denying that formula can retard and has retarded inventiveness and creativity. But to admit that formula can inhibit the writer is not to admit that it invariably does inhibit him. Almost every one of the major English writers, from the Renaissance through the eighteenth century—Chaucer, Jonson, Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, Pope, Swift, Burke—had been subjected to an intensive rhetoric course in their grammar school or university. If one cannot claim that the study of rhetoric made them great writers, one might yet venture to say that rhetoric made them better writers than they might have been on genius alone.

    Lest we raise any false hopes, however, we hasten to warn the student that this adaptation of classical rhetoric offers no magic formula for success in writing. The student will have to work hard in order to profit from the instruction offered in this book, for it is not all easy to understand, and what is learned must be applied.

    The road to eloquence is a hard road and a lonely road, and the journey
    is not for the faint-hearted. But if, as we are told, the ability to use words
    to communicate thoughts and feelings is man's most distinctively human
    accomplishment, there can be few satisfactions in life that can match the
    pride a man feels when he has attained mastery over words. As Quintilian
    said, "Therefore let us seek wholeheartedly that true majesty of expression,
    the fairest gift of God to man, without which all things are struck dumb and
    robbed both of present glory and the immortal acclaim of posterity; and let
    us press on to whatever is best, because, if we do this, we shall either reach
    the summit or at least see many others far beneath us."

    Il / DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    Formulating a Thesis

    The beginning of all discourse is a subject. Subject is the res of the res-verba
    combination that rhetoricians talked about. Res (what is said) was the prov-
    ince of rhetoric called "invention." Verba (how it is said) was the concern
    of two other parts of rhetoric, "style" and "delivery." Obviously, no decisions
    about expression can be made until one's subject matter has been clearly
    defined.

    Frequently, our subject matter is assigned to us. The teacher announces
    in class, "For next Friday I want you to write a 500-word letter to the editor
    of the school newspaper, giving your views on the proposed increase in tui-
    tion." Or the editor of a magazine writes to one of his authors and asks him
    whether he will do a 3000-word piece on the civil rights demonstrations in
    his community. Or the president of a corporation asks one of his junior ex-
    ecutives to prepare a report for the next business meeting on the success of
    the latest advertising campaign. In such instances, our subject is given to us.
    At other times, of course, an author chooses his own subject.

    But the choice or designation of a subject is only a beginning; in fact, it
    can be a dead-end if something further is not done to define the subject. It
    is not enough to decide that one is going to write on "democracy." Before
    "democracy" can become a real subject for a discourse, something must be
    predicated of it. The subject must be converted into a theme; it must, to use
    a term from logic, be stated in the form of a proposition. So our vague sub-
    ject "democracy" must become something like "Democracy is the form of
    government which best allows a man to realize his potentialities as a human
    being" or "Democracy functions best when the people are educated." Now
    we have a theme; now we have a more precise notion of what we are going
    to write about.

    FORMULATING A THESIS 35

    John Henry Newman, in a section called "Elementary Studies" in his [dea
    of a University, points out the importance of stating a subject in the form of
    i proposition. His fictitious Mr. Black is commenting on a composition writ-
    ten by a boy named Robert:

    "Now look here," Mr. Black says, "the subject is ‘Fortes fortuna ad-
    juvat' [Fortune favors the brave]; now this is a proposition; it states a
    certain general principle, and this is just what an ordinary boy would be
    sure to miss, and Robert does miss it. He goes off at once on the word
    ‘fortuna.' ‘Fortuna' was not his subject; the thesis was intended to guide
    him, for his own good; he refuses to be put into leading strings; he breaks
    loose, and runs off in his own fashion on the broad field and in wild
    chase of ‘fortune,' instead of closing with a subject, which, as being defi-
    nite, would have supported him.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Thesis Construction and Rhetorical Analysis\n\nIn the passage, Mr. Black criticizes Robert for not adhering to his teacher''s guidance when writing about ‘Fortes fortuna adjuvat.'' Apply the principles from the text to formulate a clear thesis statement for this subject.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the general principle implied by ‘Fortes fortuna adjuvat.''\n- **Step 2**: Convert this principle into a proposition that defines the subject as a specific concept.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this proposition serves as a proper thesis statement, referencing the text''s emphasis on stating subjects in the form of propositions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your thesis must be a clear, definitional proposition and demonstrate understanding of the text''s argument about the importance of precise subject definition.\n'

    "It would have been very cruel to have told a boy to write on ‘fortune'; it would have been like asking him his opinion ‘of things in general.' Fortune is ‘good,' ‘bad,' ‘capricious,' ‘unexpected,' ten thousand things all at once (you see them all in the Gradus), and one of them as much as the other. Ten thousand things may be said of it: give me one of them, and I will write upon it; I cannot write on more than one; Robert prefers to write upon all."

    Hundreds of Roberts are defeated every year in their composition classes because they will not or cannot define their subject. The Latin rhetoricians used a formula for determining the point of issue in a court trial that might help students decide on a thesis. The formula consisted of three questions that were asked about the subject of dispute or discussion:

    An sit (whether a thing is)—a question of fact
    Quid sit (what it is)—a question of definition
    Quale sit (what kind it is)—a question of quality

    In a murder trial, for instance, the case for the prosecution and the defense could turn on one of three issues:

    1. Did Brutus, as has been alleged, kill Caesar? (whether a thing is)
    2. If it is granted that Brutus did kill Caesar, was the act murder or self-defense? (what it is)
    3. If it was in fact murder, was Brutus justified in murdering Caesar? (what kind it is)

    ‘he application of this formula settles the issue in a trial and in turn sug-
    gests the topics that the lawyers resort to in arguing their case.

    will help the student determine what aspect of the subject he is going to treat,

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Formula Application**\n\nThe Latin rhetoricians'' formula for determining the point of issue in a trial consists of three questions: An sit, Quid sit, and Quale sit. Apply this formula to the following subject of dispute: ''The use of social media in education.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the three aspects of the subject using the formula.\n- **Step 2**: For each aspect, formulate a potential thesis statement that could be argued.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the formula helps in narrowing down the focus of a discourse.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate understanding of each question''s purpose and its application to a modern topic, with specific thesis examples for each aspect.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Categories**\n\nThe text suggests that a thesis statement should focus on one aspect of the subject, as determined by the rhetorical formula. Use the following scenario to justify your reasoning:\n- A student is asked to write an essay on ''The impact of technology on society.''\n- The student chooses to argue that technology is inherently good.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify which aspect of the subject (An sit, Quid sit, or Quale sit) the student''s thesis addresses.\n- **Part B**: Explain why focusing on a single aspect is more effective than addressing all three aspects simultaneously.\n- **Part C**: Provide an example of a potential thesis that would address a different aspect (e.g., ''What kind of technology is most beneficial...'').\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly link the student''s thesis to one of the three rhetorical questions and demonstrate understanding of the formula''s purpose in argumentation.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving with Rhetorical Frameworks**\n\nThe text describes how the formula helps students determine a thesis for their discourse. Create a hypothetical scenario where this formula would be used to structure an argument in a non-legal context, such as a debate on climate change.\n- **Step 1**: Choose the subject of dispute: ''The effectiveness of renewable energy sources in reducing carbon emissions.''\n- **Step 2**: Apply the three rhetorical questions (An sit, Quid sit, Quale sit) to this subject.\n- **Step 3**: For each question, develop a corresponding argument that would be used in the debate.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate all three aspects of the formula into a coherent argument structure, showing how each question narrows the focus and supports the overall discourse.

    Instructor has asked him to write a letter to the editor about the increase in tuition. What aspect of the subject is he going to talk about? Is there actually going to be an increase in tuition next term? Or has an increase only been proposed? Perhaps the student knows that the Board of Trustees has been considering an increase in tuition but has not yet formally voted on the proposal. If so, that could very well be the burden of the letter he writes:
    "The students of this university have been in an uproar about something that is not yet a fact. If they had taken the trouble to investigate the facts, they would know that they do not yet have any just cause for complaint."

    Suppose that the report about the cost per credit-hour has been confirmed. What aspect is there left to talk about? Well, he might become involved in a question of definition. Is the change from $15 to $17 per credit-hour really an increase in tuition costs? Not if one considers that the Board of Trustees has also voted to reduce the number of credit-hours that students will be allowed to take in any one semester. So although the cost per credit-hour will go up, the total cost of tuition per semester will remain the same. It is apparent that in this instance a discussion of the definition of increase could turn into a mere quibble on words, but with other subjects, like "democracy" or "socialized," there would be more of an opportunity to deal with a def-inition of terms.

    But suppose that a change in tuition has been approved and that this change does constitute a substantial increase in the cost of tuition. Now the third question (quale sit) can disclose the area of discussion. Was the increase necessary? Can it be justified? In comparison with the general rise in the cost of living, does the increase in tuition become minimal? Will the increase in tuition ensure the continuance of or even an improvement in the quality of our education? Or will the increase prevent many students from continuing their education? The application of the third question to this particular subject turns up a number of areas of discussion.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing the Rhetorical Structure of a Letter to the Editor**\n\nUsing the text provided, identify and explain how the three rhetorical questions (quid est, quid sit, et cetera) are used to structure the argument in the letter to the editor.\n- **Part A**: Describe the first question (quid est) and its purpose in establishing context.\n- **Part B**: Explain the second question (quid sit) and its role in prompting critical examination of definitions.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the third question (et cetera) and how it invites deeper analysis of the implications of a tuition change.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the three questions and their corresponding functions in the text, demonstrating an understanding of classical rhetoric as presented in the reading.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluating the Logical Implications of Tuition Changes**\n\nAssume that the tuition increase has been approved and constitutes a substantial cost rise. Using the text, evaluate whether this increase is justified by answering the following:\n- **Part A**: Compare the tuition increase to the general rise in the cost of living. Is the increase proportionate? Justify your reasoning using examples from the text.\n- **Part B**: Analyze whether the increase will ensure the quality of education or hinder student access. Use the text''s questions to frame your argument.\n- **Part C**: Propose a counterargument to the claim that the increase is necessary. How would the author of the letter respond?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s rhetorical questions and demonstrate a logical evaluation of the tuition change''s implications.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesizing Rhetorical Techniques in Persuasive Writing**\n\nUsing the text, create a persuasive argument for or against a tuition increase that incorporates all three rhetorical questions.\n- **Part A**: Introduce the issue (quid est) by defining what the tuition increase is and why it matters.\n- **Part B**: Explore the definition and implications (quid sit) of the increase, including its effects on students and the institution.\n- **Part C**: Conclude with a call to action (et cetera) based on the analysis of the tuition change''s consequences.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be structured using all three rhetorical questions and reflect the text''s approach to persuasive writing, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of classical rhetoric.'

    The subject matter considered in relation to the current situation or occasion and to the audience often dictates which of the three questions is most applicable. In any case, however, the application of the pertinent question does help to define the aspect of the subject that is to be discussed. Once that aspect has been determined, the student should be prepared to formulate a thesis sentence. Once the subject has been narrowed down, what does he want to say about his subject?

    The cardinal principle is to state the thesis in a single declarative sentence.

    It is important that the thesis be formulated in a single sentence. As soon as the student launches into a second sentence, he introduces foreign or subsidiary matter which is likely to violate the unity of his thesis. It is equally important to formulate the thesis in a declarative sentence. Hortatory sentences like "Let us fight to preserve the integrity of our democracy" and interrogatory sentences like "Is democracy a feasible form of government?" leave the subject fuzzy; both kinds of sentence have a tentative or uncertain air about them. The thesis will be clearly and firmly stated if the predicate asserts or denies something about the subject: "The integrity of our democracy can be preserved only if we fight to maintain it"; "Democracy is (is not) a feasible form of government."

    The thesis sentence is a good starting-point in the composition process because it forces the writer to determine at the outset just what it is that he wants to say about his chosen or designated subject. Moreover, it lays the foundation for a unified, coherent discourse. Then, too, it often suggests some of the topics that can be used for the development of the discourse.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Thesis Construction in Rhetorical Writing**\n\nWrite a single, declarative thesis sentence that addresses the following topic: "The role of education in promoting civic responsibility."\n- **Guidelines**:\n  - Your thesis must directly assert or deny something about the topic (e.g., ''Education is essential for fostering civic responsibility'').\n  - Avoid any interrogative orhortatory language (e.g., ''Should education promote civic responsibility?'').\n  - Your sentence must be concise and clearly state the main claim of your essay.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your thesis must be a single, complete sentence that clearly defines the central argument of your essay on education and civic responsibility.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Thesis Evaluation in Rhetorical Analysis**\n\nEvaluate the following thesis sentence for clarity and adherence to the principles discussed in the text: \n''Education is a vital tool for shaping democratic values, yet it is often ineffective in practice.''\n- **Task**:\n  - Determine whether this sentence meets the criteria of a strong thesis (single declarative statement, clear assertion).\n  - Identify any potential issues with the sentence based on the text''s guidance (e.g., use of ''yet'' may introduce ambiguity).\n  - Suggest a revised version that adheres strictly to the principles of rhetorical thesis construction.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your evaluation must directly reference the text''s principles and provide a clear, revised thesis sentence that meets all criteria.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Thesis Development for a Persuasive Essay**\n\nFormulate a thesis sentence for a persuasive essay on the topic: "The impact of social media on political engagement."\n- **Requirements**:\n  - The thesis must be a single, declarative sentence that asserts a clear position.\n  - It should avoid any hedging language (e.g., ''probably,'' ''might'').\n  - It must be specific enough to guide the structure of the essay.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your thesis must be a strong, direct statement that clearly defines the argument you will make in your essay about social media and political engagement.'

    Say that a student took as his thesis this proposition: "Democracy is a
    feasible form of government for the newly emergent countries of South
    Africa." That statement precisely defines what the student wants to say about
    his subject: he is going to argue that a democratic form of government will
    work in South Africa. If the student keeps that objective constantly in mind,
    there is a good chance that his discourse will have a tight unity. The mere
    verbalization of the thesis also suggests some lines of development. Will he
    not, for instance, have to define at the beginning of his essay at least two of
    the key terms in his proposition, democracy and feasible? Will it not be ad-
    visable also to specify which countries of South Africa he is talking about?
    Is it possible that in arguing the feasibility of a democratic government in
    certain countries of South Africa he could compare the situation in these
    countries with the situation in other countries where democracy proved suc-
    cessful? The statement of his thesis has already suggested the topics of defi-
    nition and comparison as possible lines of argument and has also suggested
    it possible organization of his essay that will be conducive to coherence.

    Defining the thesis in a single declarative sentence will also help the student
    determine whether he can adequately handle the given or chosen subject
    within the word limit set for him. The subject "democracy" is so broad that
    the student could not forecast how much development would be necessary.
    A proposition like "Democracy is the best form of government" is still some-
    what broad and vague, but at least it fixes some limits to the subject. The
    student could perhaps not do justice to such a thesis in 500 words; but he
    might be able to treat it satisfactorily in 1500-2000 words. On the other hand,
    a proposition like "Representative democracy allows each citizen to exercise
    some voice in the conduct of his government" might very well be satisfac-
    torily treated in 500 words.

    Simple as the principle is, many students have difficulty in framing their
    thesis in a single declarative sentence. Part of their difficulty stems from the
    fact that they do not have a firm grasp on their ideas before they sit down
    to compose a thesis sentence. Thought and language interact upon each other.

    Hugh Blair once said, "For we may rest assured that whenever we express ourselves ill, there is, besides the mismanagement of language, for the most part, some mistake in our manner of conceiving the subject. Embarrassed, obscure, and feeble sentences are generally, if not always, the result of embarrassed, obscure, and feeble thought."

    It often takes considerable practice before the student acquires the ability to define his thesis sharply. He can foster the development of this ability if he will make a habit of formulating a thesis sentence for any formal prose he reads. Sometimes the author helps him by stating his thesis somewhere in the essay, and in that case his job is to detect that thematic sentence. In some cases, however, the central idea of an essay is nowhere explicitly stated, and he must be able to abstract the central idea from the whole essay. The ability to generalize in this way is often the last ability the student acquires in learning how to read. If he cannot abstract a thesis from what he reads, it is not likely that he will have much success in formulating his own thesis sentences.

    He must acquire this ability if he hopes to be able to communicate clearly and coherently with others through the medium of written prose. Failure to sharply define one's subject is the chief cause of fuzzy, disunified discourse. Vague beginnings invite chaotic endings. The audience for a discourse, whether written or spoken, can achieve no firmer grasp of the thesis than the writer or speaker himself has. As a matter of fact, if we make allowance for what is inevitably lost in the process of transmission, the audience's grasp will always be less firm than the writer's or speaker's.

    So we round back to what was said at the beginning of this chapter: the beginning of all good writing is a sharply defined subject. Just as it would be folly to set out by automobile from New York to Los Angeles without a sheaf of road maps in the glove compartment, so it would be futile to start inscribing words on a blank sheet of paper without having carefully plotted one's direction and destination. This is the first lesson about writing that the student must learn. Until he learns it, he will arrive nowhere.

    Rationality is man's essential characteristic. It is what makes man human and differentiates him from other animals. Ideally, reason should dominate all of man's thinking and actions, but actually, man is often influenced by passions and prejudices and customs. To say that man often responds to irrational motives is not to say that he never listens to the voice of reason. We must have faith not only that man is capable of ordering his life by the dictutes of reason but that most of the time he is disposed to do so. Because the rhetoricians had that faith in their fellow men, they thought of rhetoric as an offshoot of logic, the science of human reasoning. "Rhetoric is the counterpart of dialectics," Aristotle said in the first sentence of his Rhetoric. Aristotle had dealt with strict logic in the six treatises that collectively have been called the Organon, and in two of these treatises, the Prior Analytics and the Posterior Analytics, he had dealt primarily with deductive and inductive reasoning. Dialectics was the popular form of "analytics" or logic, in the same way that rhetoric was the popular form of the strict demonstration that took place in the sciences. Plato's Dialogues, with their give-and-take of question and answer, are good examples of the informal way in which men argue logically with one another. Similarly, rhetoric is the practical art by which we learn how to manipulate all the available means of persuading a large, heterogeneous, perhaps uneducated audience. The appeals to reason that an orator might use do not violate the principles of strict logic; they are merely adaptations of logic. So, whereas the syllogism and induction are the forms that reasoning takes in logic, the enthymeme and the example are the forms that reasoning takes in rhetoric.

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Rhetoric as an Adaptation of Logic**\n\nBased on the text''s assertion that rhetoric is a practical art for persuading heterogeneous audiences, analyze how an orator might use the appeals of *ethos*, *pathos*, and *logos* to adapt strict logic for different audience types.\n- **Part A**: Explain how *ethos* might be used to establish credibility in a scientific context.\n- **Part B**: Describe how *pathos* could be employed to engage an emotionally driven audience.\n- **Part C**: Illustrate how *logos* can be adapted to use inductive reasoning for a lay audience.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly link each rhetorical appeal to a logical principle and demonstrate an understanding of how rhetoric transforms logic for practical persuasion.'

- prompt: "Whenever formal deductive or inductive logic is \"an available means of  \npersuasion,\" we should, of course, make use of it. In literary and scientific  \njournals, we often find the authors of articles presenting masses of evidence  \nor employing full-fledged deductive reasoning in order to convince their  \nprofessional colleagues of the soundness of their experiments or theses. Even  \nin popularized articles on abstruse subjects, where we do not expect to get  \nthe full panoply of logical demonstrations, those authors who are jealous of  \ntheir professional reputations will take care not to violate the principles of  \nlogical reasoning.\n\nAs a foundation for the discussion of the rhetorical appeals to reason, we  \nwill review some of the principles of logic. First, let us consider the matter  \nof definition.\n\nPRINCIPLES OF DEFINITION\n\nExposition and argumentation often turn on definition. Exposition, in fact,  \nis a form of definition. In order to explain something, we have to tell what  \na thing is or describe it or enumerate its parts or demonstrate its operation. A dictionary is an expository work—a work that defines, not things, but  \nwords which stand for things. All \"how to\" books are primarily expository,  \nbecause, by showing how something works or operates, these books are in  \na sense explaining or defining that thing. Discourses that analyze or classify  \nthings are also instances of expository definition.\n\nIn the Topica, one of his treatises on logic, Aristotle lays down the princi-  \nples governing what is commonly referred to as an \"essential definition.\" An essential definition is one that designates that which makes a thing what  \nit is and distinguishes that thing from all other things; in other words, it  \nis one that spells out a thing's fundamental nature. For instance, the widely  \naccepted essential definition of man is as follows: \"A man is a rational ani-  \nmal.\" The predicate term \"rational animal\" designates a man's essence and  \ncannot be used of any other creature.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Essential Definitions**\n\nConsider the essential definition of man given in the text: ''A man is a rational animal.''\n- **Part A**: Using the principles of definition from the text, explain why this definition is essential. What makes it distinguish man from other animals?\n- **Part B**: Construct an analogous essential definition for the concept of '' democracy'' that follows the same structural and logical principles.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate whether the definition ''A triangle is a three-sided polygon'' meets the criteria of an essential definition according to the text. Justify your answer with logical reasoning based on the text''s description of essential definitions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the principles of essential definition from the text and demonstrate logical reasoning based on the provided principles.'

The proposition "A man is a rational animal" can be converted to "A rational animal is a man." The proposition is as true in its second form as it is in its first. Let us apply the test to another definition of man, "Man is a biped animal." When we convert the proposition to "A biped animal is a man," we can readily see that the "truth" has been upset, because while it is true that every man is a biped animal, it is not true that every biped animal is a man. "Two-footedness" is a characteristic of man, but it does not designate the essence of man. "Rationality" does designate man's essence, not only because it is characteristic of man, but because it "belongs" exclusively to man.

    In an essential definition, the subject and predicate are equivalent terms. In a loose sense, an essential definition sets up an equation: man equals rational animal; rational animal equals man. To use another analogy, the subject term in an essential definition must "weigh" as much as the predicate term. We must be able to interchange the weights on the scale and still keep the scale in balance. That's the trouble with the terms man and biped animal—they do not "weigh" the same.

    It was Aristotle, with his biologist's passion for classification, who showed us how to formulate an essential definition. We put the "thing to be defined" (the definiendum) into a genus or general class and then give the differentiae or the specific differences that distinguish this thing from every other thing comprehended in the same general class. In the essential definition that we used, "animal" is the genus, and "rational" is the differentia that distinguishes man from every other creature that can be classified as an animal.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Conversion of Essential Definitions**\n\nConsider the essential definition: "Man is a rational animal." Apply the conversion test by interchanging the subject and predicate terms to form the proposition: "A rational animal is a man."\n- **Task A**: Explain why this converted proposition maintains the same truth value as the original.\n- **Task B**: Apply the conversion test to the definition "Man is a biped animal." Convert it to "A biped animal is a man" and explain why the truth value changes.\n- **Task C**: Based on the text''s explanation, define what makes a term "essential" in this context.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of the conversion test, the distinction between essential and loose definitions, and the role of equivalence in defining essence.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Formulating Essential Definitions**\n\nUsing Aristotle''s method, construct an essential definition for "triangle" by identifying a genus and differentiae.\n- **Task A**: Choose an appropriate genus for "triangle" (e.g., polygon).\n- **Task B**: Identify the differentiae that distinguish a triangle from other polygons.\n- **Task C**: Justify why your definition is essential by applying the conversion test (i.e., interchanging subject and predicate).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must follow Aristotle''s method, clearly state the genus and differentiae, and demonstrate equivalence through conversion.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Essential Definitions**\n\nAnalyze the essential definition of man as "a rational animal" in light of the text''s discussion on equivalence and classification.\n- **Task A**: Explain why "rationality" is essential to defining man, not just "bipedness."\n- **Task B**: Compare and contrast the essential definition with a loose definition (e.g., "Man is a human being").\n- **Task C**: Construct an essential definition for "fire" by following the text''s method of genus and differentiae.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate concepts from the text, demonstrate logical reasoning about essentiality, and apply the method to a new concept.\n'

- prompt: "The student must not get the idea that the differentia will always be given  \nin a single word, as in our definition of man. Sometimes we have to designate  \nseveral differences in order to distinguish the thing from other things in  \nthe same class. Consider this definition for instance: \"An automobile is a  \nvehicle that runs on four wheels.\" We have the genus (vehicle) and a dif-  \nferentia (runs on four wheels), but obviously this differentia is not suficient  \nto distinguish an automobile from other vehicles that run on four wheels.  \nThe etymology of the word suggests another differentia that would help to  \ndistinguish an automobile—auto, \"self-,\" and modbilis, \"movable.\" So we  \nwould add that this four-wheeled vehicle is propelled by an internal engine.  \nIf this were not sufficient to distinguish an automobile we could add dif-  \nferentiae which specify the kind of engine that propelled it, the material  \nthe vehicle is made of, its shape, and what it is used for.\n\nThe differentiae in a definition often specify one or more of the four causes  \nof a thing: the material, the formal, the efficient, and the final. For instance,  \nif one were explaining a table, one might say that a table is a piece of furni-  \nture (the genus) made by a carpenter (efficient cause) from wood (material  \ncause) with a broad, flat top resting horizontally on four legs (formal cause)  \non which one puts things, often dishes for a meal (final cause, the end or  \npurpose of the thing). It goes without saying that the differentiae will change  \nif we attempt to define various kinds of tables. Some tables are made of  \nmetal or stone by metalworkers or stonemasons; some tables rest on three  \nlegs, others on six; people use tables for a variety of purposes, e.g. to sit or  \nstand at while they are writing or drawing or cutting cloth.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Definition Components**\n\nUsing the passage, explain how a definition can include multiple differentiae to distinguish an object from others in the same class. Provide an example from everyday life that demonstrates this concept, and explain why a single differentia might not be sufficient.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the genus and at least two differentiae from the passage.\n- **Step 2**: Construct a definition for an object (e.g., a smartphone) that includes multiple differentiae.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why a single differentia (e.g., ''electronic device'') is insufficient to uniquely define the object.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the passage''s explanation of differentiae and demonstrate logical reasoning about classification.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Definition Causes**\n\nThe passage mentions four causes (material, formal, efficient, final) in defining objects. Select an object (e.g., a chair) and construct a definition that incorporates at least two of these causes.\n- **Part A**: Identify the genus (e.g., furniture) and two differentiae that correspond to two of the four causes.\n- **Part B**: Explain how these differentiae relate to their respective causes (e.g., ''made of wood'' corresponds to material cause).\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the role of differentiae from the passage with the four causes, explaining why this distinction is important for precise definitions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the passage''s discussion of causes and differentiae, showing a clear understanding of their roles in classification.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Definition Principles**\n\nDesign a definition for a new object (e.g., a solar-powered drone) that includes at least three differentiae and references two of the four causes from the passage.\n- **Part A**: Choose a genus (e.g., aerial vehicle) and three differentiae that specify the object''s characteristics.\n- **Part B**: Identify two causes (e.g., material cause and final cause) and explain how they are represented in the differentiae.\n- **Part C**: Justify why this definition is more precise than a single differentia, using examples from the passage.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate creative problem-solving and a deep understanding of the passage''s definition principles.'

    The student will find it instructive to open his dictionary at random and look at the definitions of nouns on the page he opens. He will find that most definitions of nouns follow the Aristotelian pattern: the substantive is assigned to a general class and then differentiated in one or more ways. He will also find that a dictionary does not often attain or even strive for an essential definition. For practical purposes, we do not often need the precision or exclusiveness of an essential definition. And besides, it is extremely difficult to arrive at, or to know when we have arrived at, an essential definition. Most of us would find it frustrating to specify the essence of a typewriter (even though we would be able to pick out a typewriter from a group of other artifacts), and unless we have desperate need of an essential definition, we do not take the trouble to seek one. We will settle for a serviceable definition of a typewriter. On the other hand, philosophers have sought an essential definition of man because it has seemed important to determine just what a man's essence is.

    Definitions of anything will vary, of course, according to the definer's
    point of view and his particular basis of classification. In fact, one of the
    ways to distinguish the various branches of knowledge is to note the methods
    and bases of definition used by each science. A biologist, for instance, might
    define a man as "an erect, bipedal, giant mammal relatively unspecialized in
    body form." Or if he were attempting an operative definition, he might
    define man as "the only creature capable of modifying his evolutionary
    future." A behavioral scientist might define man as a "social animal" or a
    "tool-making creature" or "a creature that prepares its food with fire." A
    theologian might define man as "an adopted son of God." Each of these
    definitions is true in its own way, and each of them tells us something use-
    ful to know about man. For some purposes, we will find the biologist's defi-
    nition of man more useful than the logician's definition. (In Vercors's
    fascinating novel You Shall Know Them, a murder trial turns on whether
    the strange creatures that a scientist has discovered in the jungle and brought
    back to civilization can be classified as human. In our space age, we may be
    faced with a similar problem if we find some form of primate life on other
    planets.) A rhetorician is especially interested in the fact that words admit
    of a variety of valid definitions.

    OTHER METHODS OF DEFINITION
    Synonyms

    There are other ways to define words besides the Aristotelian method of
    giving the genus and the specific differences. One of the common ways is to
    cite synonyms. We often resort to this method in the case of adjectives, nouns,

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Definition Methods**\n\nCompare and contrast the Aristotelian method of definition (genus and specific differences) with the synonym method, using examples from the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two different definitions provided in the text and classify them as either Aristotelian or synonym-based.\n- **Step 2**: Explain the purpose and advantages of each method in different contexts (e.g., biological classification vs. rhetorical analysis).\n- **Step 3**: Apply this understanding to the example of ''human'' given in the text. Justify which method would be more appropriate for a biologist versus a rhetorician.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly distinguish between the two methods and demonstrate an understanding of their applications in different fields.'

Consider the word ''human'' and its synonyms: ''man,'' ''mankind,'' ''person.''\n- **Part A**: Explain why the text suggests that synonyms can be effective for defining terms, especially in rhetoric.\n- **Part B**: Create a definition of ''human'' using the synonym method and compare it to the Aristotelian method used by the biologist.\n- **Part C**: Analyze how the use of synonyms can be both flexible and limiting in definitions.

    and verbs. So if we want to convey the meaning of inflexible, we might cite
    such synonyms as adamant, implacable, obdurate, stiff, unbending; to clarify
    the meaning of infer we might offer such synonyms as deduce, conclude,
    judge, gather. Aristotle questioned this method of definition; he maintained
    that a real definition could be rendered only in a phrase. And he was probably
    right, for although a synonym can illuminate the meaning of a strange word,
    it does not really inform us about the mode of being of that word. Still and
    all, synonyms do play a useful part in clarifying the words used to convey
    ideas or feelings.

    I'tymology

    Closely allied to definition by synonyms is definition by reference to etymol-
    ogy. One might explain the meaning of inflexible by pointing out that the
    word derives from the Latin prefix in-, meaning in this case "not," the
    [Latin verb flectere, meaning "to bend," and the suffix -zble, meaning "able to
    be'—hence "not able to be bent." A study of etymology can throw light
    on the meaning of words, can suggest subtle shades of meaning, and can
    serve as a mnemonic device—especially for those who have some knowledge
    of the parent languages. But there is one caution about relying on etymology
    lor the meaning of words: the meanings frequently drift far from the etymo-
    logical roots. The English word police, to take only one example, has strayed
    considerably from its root in the Greek word polites, meaning "citizen."
    Citing the etymology of democracy might stir up more arguments than it
    would settle.

    Description

    Another method of definition, frequently used to convey a notion of a com-
    plex organization or mechanism, is the extended description. These descrip-
    tions often mention the genus and several of the properties and accidents of
    the thing to be defined, but the definition is presented in discursive prose
    rather than in the tight, unitary phrases that a dictionary uses. Comparisons,
    analogies, metaphors, and similes are frequently employed to facilitate defi-
    nitions by description.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Synonym and Etymology in Definition**\n\nGiven the text''s discussion of synonym-based definitions and etymological explanations, construct a definition for the word ''obstinate'' using both methods.\n- **Part A**: Use synonyms to define ''obstinate.'' Cite at least two synonyms from the text (e.g., ''unyielding,'' ''perseverant'').\n- **Part B**: Provide an etymological explanation for ''obstinate'' based on its Latin roots. Reference the text''s example of ''inflexible'' (in- + flectere + -able).\n- **Part C**: Explain why the text cautions against relying solely on etymology for word meanings, using the example of ''police'' and ''democracy.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly integrate both synonym-based and etymological methods, while addressing the text''s caution about etymology.

    A method especially useful in defining abstractions is giving an example.
    The dubious syntax, "Honesty is when..." is usually a signal that we are
    about to get a definition by this method. A definition by example might
    run something like this:

    You ask me what honesty is. Well, I'll tell you. One night about 10:30
    while a rather elderly man was walking to the subway after work, he
    spied a black purse lying in the gutter. Some woman must have dropped
    it as she was getting into a cab. He looked about him. There was no one
    else on the street at the moment. He picked up the purse and opened it.
    Inside the purse was a bundle of ten-dollar bills bound with a rubber-
    band. Riffing through the bills, he estimated that there was 150 to 200
    dollars in the bundle. The only identification in the purse was an envelope
    bearing the name and address of a lawyer. What should he do? Nobody
    had seen him pick up the purse. The woman who had dropped the purse
    obviously didn't need the money as desperately as he did. The money
    could solve a lot of his financial problems at home. He was tempted. But
    he knew he wouldn't sleep at night if he took the purse home. He snapped
    the purse shut and walked two blocks out of his way to turn the purse in
    at the police station. You ask me what honesty is. That is honesty.

    Defining by example has long been a favorite device of preachers, orators,
    and teachers. The exemplum, an anecdote or short tale with a moral, once
    played a prominent part in literature. Aesop's Fables and Chaucer's Par-
    doner's Tale are just two instances of this genre.

    In conclusion, here are three rules which should govern our attempts to
    define terms:

    1. The defining terms should be clearer and more familiar than the
    term to be defined.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Definition by Example**\n\nYou are asked to define the concept of ''honesty'' using the method of defining by example.\n- **Step 1**: Create a concise narrative that illustrates the moral of honesty, similar to the example provided in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Ensure that your example is self-contained, with a clear beginning, middle, and end.\n- **Step 3**: Identify the defining feature of honesty in your example and explain how it reflects the broader concept.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of defining by example and clearly connect the narrative to the definition of honesty.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Definition Rules**\n\nThe text provides three rules for defining terms. Consider the following scenario: You are tasked with defining ''intelligence'' using the method of example, but you must adhere strictly to the three rules provided.\n- **Part A**: Choose a scenario that clearly illustrates ''intelligence'' and is self-contained.\n- **Part B**: Apply Rule 1, ensuring that the terms in your example are clearer than ''intelligence''.\n- **Part C**: Explain how your example adheres to the three rules and why this method is effective for defining abstract concepts.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must analyze the rules and demonstrate how they apply to your example.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Exemplum**\n\nYou are to create an exemplum (a short tale with a moral) that defines the concept of ''perseverance''.\n- **Step 1**: Develop a narrative that illustrates perseverance, including a clear challenge and resolution.\n- **Step 2**: Ensure the moral of the story is directly tied to the concept of perseverance.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this exemplum effectively defines perseverance using the three rules from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must showcase creativity and a deep understanding of how exemplum serves as a defining method.'

    This principle is so self-evident that it hardly needs to be enunciated, yet it does need some qualification. Dr. Johnson's notorious definition of a network as a "reticulated fabric, decussated at regular intervals, with interstices at the intersections" is not very enlightening to someone who has no notion of a network—although this much-ridiculed definition is remarkably accurate and precise. By using more familiar words, modern dictionaries succeed in conveying a clearer notion of a network. The real difficulty in observing the first rule presents itself when one has to define a relatively simple, everyday object. How does one define an egg? Will not the defining terms necessarily be "harder" words than the term to be defined?

    2. The definition should not repeat the term to be defined or use synonymous or derivative terms.

    As we said above, synonyms do not really define; they are merely similar, perhaps more familiar words, which may illuminate the meaning of an unknown word. Nor can the repetition of the same word or of an inflectionally derivative word do much to clarify the meaning of the definiendum. So we should avoid definitions like these: "Justice is a virtue which prompts a man to deal justly with another man"; "Man is a creature possessing a human nature"; or definitions like Bardolph's in King Henry IV, Part Two, Act III, scene ii: "Accommodated: that is, when a man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is, being, whereby 'a may be thought to be accommodated—which is an excellent thing."

    3. The definition, wherever possible, should be stated positively, not negatively.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Definition Principles**\n\nThe text discusses three key principles for effective definitions: clarity, avoiding repetition or synonyms, and using positive rather than negative statements.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the definition of a network as "a reticulated fabric, decussated at regular intervals, with interstices at the intersections" is considered more precise than a modern dictionary''s definition, even though it uses unfamiliar terms.\n- **Part B**: Critique the definition: "Justice is a virtue which prompts a man to deal justly with another man." Identify at least two issues with this definition based on the text''s principles.\n- **Part C**: Provide a positive, non-repetitive definition of "man" that adheres to the text''s guidelines.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the three principles outlined in the text and demonstrate an understanding of how each principle contributes to clarity in definition.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Definitional Challenges**\n\nThe text raises a challenge in defining everyday objects like an egg. Consider the following: \n- **Part A**: Why is it difficult to define an egg without using terms that are "harder" than the term to be defined? Use examples from the text to support your argument.\n- **Part B**: Propose a definition for "egg" that avoids both synonyms and negative statements. Justify why this definition meets the text''s criteria for a good definition.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the difficulty in defining simple objects relates to the broader concept of language and meaning, as discussed in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s perspective on definitions and demonstrate an understanding of the philosophical implications of definitional challenges.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Definition Principles**\n\nThe text emphasizes the importance of avoiding synonymous terms and using positive statements in definitions. Apply these principles to create original definitions for the following: \n- **Part A**: Define "light" without using synonyms like "illumination" or "brightness."\n- **Part B**: Define "strength" without using synonymous terms like "power" or "force."\n- **Part C**: Create a definition for "balance" that is positive and does not repeat the term.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your definitions must strictly adhere to the text''s principles and demonstrate a clear understanding of how each definition avoids the pitfalls discussed in the reading.'

    The phrase "wherever possible" has to be inserted here because sometimes a
    concept is so obscure or ambiguous that it is difficult to define it positively;
    in such cases we realize some gain if we are told at least what the concept
    is not. Of course, concepts that are themselves negative in meaning can
    hardly be defined positively. So a concept like darkness has to be defined
    negatively as "the absence of light." There can be a rhetorical advantage
    also in the use of negative definitions—for instance, a series of statements
    telling what a thing is not before one comes forth with the statement of
    what a thing is. The kind of definition that the third rule cautions against
    is one like this: "Democracy is that form of government which does not
    deprive its citizens of their civil liberties." If this is the only definition of
    democracy offered, no one is going to have much of an idea about what
    democracy is.

    THE SYLLOGISM

    The syllogism was a schematic device that Aristotle invented to analyze and
    test deductive reasoning. People in real life rarely argue in a strict syllogistic
    form, but the syllogism is a useful device for analyzing the method or form
    that people observe when they reason deductively. We cannot give a full
    course in logic here, but we can set down some of the basic principles govern-
    ing this form of deductive reasoning.

    The syllogism reasons from statements or propositions. These propositions
    are called premises. The reasoning follows this course: if a is true, and b is
    true, then c must be true. Before we consider the syllogism itself, we should
    say something about the kinds of propositions that appear in categorical
    syllogisms. Let us start out with the square of opposition, a device that
    logicians invented mainly for mnemonic purposes (see figure on page 46).

    The square of opposition presents schematically the four kinds of categorical
    propositions—that is, propositions that either assert or deny something, with-
    out conditions or alternatives proposed.

    The A-proposition (All men are mortal beings) is a universal affirm-
    ative.
    46 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    The E-proposition (No men are mortal beings) is a universal nega-
    tive.

    The I-proposition (Some men are mortal beings) is a particular affirmative.

    The O-proposition (Some men are not mortal beings) is a particular negative.

    The letters attached to these propositions happen to be the first four vowels in the English alphabet, but these letters were chosen to label the propositions because they are the first two vowels in two pertinent Latin verbs:

    AFFIRMO (I affirm)—so the A and I are attached to the affirmative propositions.
    NEGO (I deny)—so the E and O are attached to the negative propositions.

    In argument, it is frequently necessary that one be able to classify propositions as to their quantity and quality. When we ask about the quantity of a proposition, we are seeking to determine whether the proposition is universal or particular—that is, whether a statement is being made about a whole class or about only part of a class. When we ask about the quality of a proposition, we are seeking to determine whether the proposition is affirmative or negative—that is, whether the predicate asserts something about the subject or denies something about the subject. Notice that the two propositions above the horizontal line drawn through the square of opposition are universal propositions; the two below the line are particular propositions.
    The two propositions to the left of the vertical line are affirmative propositions; the two propositions to the right of the vertical line are negative propositions.

    A language has its own lexical and grammatical devices for indicating
    the quantity and quality of propositions. In English, universal propositions
    are signalled by such words as every, all, no before the subject term of the
    propositions. Particular propositions are signalled by such words as some,
    most, many, a few, the majority of. The presence of the adverb not in the
    predicate indicates that a proposition is negative. But propositions can also
    be rendered negative in English by the presence of no, none, none of the,
    not all, not any of the in the subject.

    In classifying propositions, one never has any difficulty determining
    whether a proposition is affirmative or negative. One does have difficulty
    at times, however, determining the quantity of a proposition. What is the
    quantity, for instance, of a proposition with a proper name as the subject,
    cg. "John Smith is mortal"? It seems that since we are asserting something
    about a particular person, the proposition must be particular. Most logicians,
    however, would classify this as a universal affirmative, because mortality
    is being predicated of the entire subject in the same way as in the propo-
    sition, "All men are mortal," mortality is being predicated of the whole class
    of men. By the same reasoning, "John Smith is not mortal" would be classi-
    ed as a universal negative.

    How does one classify the quantity of a proposition like "Men are more
    stable emotionally than women"? If one is arguing face to face with some-
    one, he can stop his opponent and ask him to clarify the quantity of his
    statements:

    "Look, you just said that men are more stable emotionally than
    women. Do you mean all men or just some men?"

    "I mean some men...no, I'll go so far as to say the majority of
    men."

    "All right, go on—but remember now what limits you have placed
    on the extension of your term."

    Whenever we are engaged in discussions or arguments with someone present before us, we frequently stop him to ask for clarifications of statements. Similarly, when we see a categorical statement in print we cannot call upon the author for clarification. The common practice in such circumstances is to assume, especially if the assertion has the air of a general statement—e.g., "Juakers are zealous, sincere pacifists" or "Birds are feathered creatures"—that the author meant the statement to be taken as a universal. In reconstructing his argument for the purpose of analysis, we would put an "all" in front of the subject term.

    How does one classify a proposition like "All men are not mortal"? It is clearly a negative proposition, but despite the "All" in front of the subject term, this proposition does not have the same meaning as the E-proposition,
    " No men are mortal." "All men are not mortal" is the contradictory form of "All men are mortal." In the square of opposition, contradictory propositions are opposed diagonally. So "All men are not mortal" is really an O-proposition, equivalent in meaning to "Some men are not mortal." The same would be true if the statement took the form of "Not all men are mortal." The final test must always be the meaning, not the form, of the statement.

    It is customary and useful to put categorical statements in the following form:

    (Quantity word) (substantive) (copulative verb) (substantive)
    Example: All men are mortal beings

    Oftentimes, statements put in this form will be awkward and unidiomatic.
    "All men are mortal" is certainly more idiomatic than "All men are mortal beings." Frequently, too, assertions are made with transitive or intransitive verbs—e.g. "Men run faster than women" and "Most men can hit a golf ball farther than most women can." Putting such categorical statements into the prescribed form frequently results in some very awkward locutions:

    "Men run faster than women." > "All men are faster runners than women."
    "Most men can hit a golf ball farther than most women can." > "Some men are athletes capable of hitting a golf ball farther than most women can."

    The reason for putting statements into the prescribed form is that when these statements occur in syllogisms it is easier for the beginner to pick out terms. As we shall see, some of the rules for a valid syllogism involve the distribution of terms. So it is important that we be able to ascertain the terms. Substantives with their cluster of modifiers are easier to pick out than terms hidden in predicate adjectives or action verbs. After the student has had practice analyzing arguments, he can dispense with this conversion process and deal with statements in their natural form.

    One can learn a great deal about the process of deductive reasoning from studying the relationships of propositions in the square of opposition. Here are the valid deductions we can make from the various propositions:

    1. If the A-proposition is true, the I-proposition must be true; like-
    wise, if the E-proposition is true, the O-proposition must be true.

    If it is true that all men are mortal, it logically follows that some
    men are mortal. And if it is true that no men are mortal, it is
    equally true that some men are not mortal.
    THE APPEAL TO REASON 49

    2. If the I-proposition is true, no deduction can be made about the
    A-proposition; likewise, if the O-proposition is true, no deduc-
    tion can be made about the E-proposition.

    If we determine that some men are mortal, we cannot infer from
    that fact that all men are mortal. In other words, we cannot
    infer the truth of the universal proposition from the particular
    proposition; we have to prove the truth of the universal.

    3. If the A-proposition is true, the E-proposition is false; likewise,
    if the E-proposition is true, the A-proposition is false.

    We know a priori that if one of a pair of contrary propositions
    is true, the other is necessarily false. Common sense tells us that
    if all men are mortal, the contrary proposition "No men are mor-
    tal" must be false.

    4. If the A-proposition is false, no deduction can be made about the
    E-proposition; likewise, if the E-proposition is false, no deduction
    can be made about the A-proposition.

    Although, as we saw in (3), contrary propositions cannot both be
    true, they both may be false. So if the proposition "No men are
    mortal" is false, we may not conclude that all men are mortal.
    That proposition may also be false.

    5. In the case of contradictory propositions (A and O; E and J),
    one of them must be true and the other false. Accordingly, these
    are the valid deductions we may make about the propositions
    opposed diagonally in the square of opposition:

    If A is true, O must be false.
    If A is false, O must be true.
    If O is true, A must be false.
    If O is false, A must be true.
    If E is true, I must be false.
    If E is false, I must be true.
    If I is true, E must be false.
    If I is false, E must be true.

    The law of contradiction is based on the principle that a thing cannot at the
    same time be and not be. This law plays an important part as one of the
    means of logical proof in persuasive discourse.

    6. If the I-proposition is true, no deduction can be made about the
    O-proposition; likewise, if the O-proposition is true, no deduc-
    tion can be made about the I-proposition.

    If the I-proposition is false, the O-proposition is true; likewise,
    if the O-proposition is false, the I-proposition is true.

    In the case of subcontraries (the propositions opposed horizontally at the
    bottom of the square of opposition), both of them can be true, but both of
    them cannot be false (compare this with the relationship between contrary
    propositions). It is easier to see that both the subcontraries could be true if
    we take the propositions "Some men are Republicans" and "Some men are
    not Republicans." But we cannot deduce the truth of one from the truth of
    the other. We can, however, infer the truth of one from the falsity of the
    other.

    We are now ready to look at a syllogism. The following syllogism has
    become Exhibit A in almost every elementary book of logic:

    All men are mortal beings.
    Socrates is a man.
    Therefore, Socrates is a mortal being.

- prompt: |-
    This syllogism sets forth the full chain of reasoning that is implicit in a
    statement like this: "Socrates is bound to die too, because he is, like the rest
    of us, a human being." The syllogism is made up of three categorical prop-
    ositions, the first two of them being called premises, the last one being the
    conclusion drawn from these premises. The categorical syllogism is built
    on three terms: a major term, a minor term, and a middle term. Here are
    the simple criteria for picking out these terms:

    The major term is the predicate term of the conclusion ("mortal
    beings").

    The minor term is the subject term of the conclusion ("Socrates").

    The middle term is the term that appears in both of the premises
    but does not appear in the conclusion ("men" and its singular
    form "man").

    The syllogism is made up of three propositions: a major premise, a minor
    premise, and a conclusion. The major premise is the proposition that con-
    tains the major term ("All men are mortal beings"). The minor premise is
    the proposition that contains the minor term ("Socrates is a man"). In con-
    structing a syllogism, we usually put the major premise first—although it
    should be understood that in actual deductive reasoning the major premise
    could occur in any order and, in fact, need not be expressed at all (see the
    later discussion of the enthymeme).

- prompt: |-
    It is not so easy to define the conclusion. We could say that the conclusion
    is the proposition deduced from the two premises or that the conclusion is
    the proposition that contains both the major term and the minor term but
    not the middle term. But such definitions involve us in a circular argument.
    We cannot determine the major and minor premises unless we know the
    major term and the minor term, and we cannot determine the major and
    minor terms unless we know which proposition is the conclusion. If we were
    to remove the word Therefore from the third proposition in our model syl-
    logism and if we were then to scramble the order of the propositions, it
    would be impossible to tell which of the propositions was the conclusion.
    Any one of the propositions could serve as the conclusion, although only
    one combination—the combination in our model—would produce a valid
    syllogism.

    The main point of this is that we cannot reconstruct a syllogism from
    deductive reasoning as we are likely to find it in argumentative discourse
    unless we can pick out the conclusion. In the enthymeme, "Socrates is bound
    to die too, because he is, like the rest of us, a human being," the first clause
    is clearly the conclusion; because signals one of the reasons or premises for
    the conclusion. In argumentative discourse, conclusions are often signalled
    by the use of such function words as therefore, thus, hence, consequently, so.
    ‘The context of an argument will also serve as a guide to the conclusion.

    So much for the form of the syllogism. Before we set down the rules for a valid syllogism, we need to establish two important points. The first is the distinction between truth and validity. Truth has to do with the matter of the syllogism; validity has to do with the form of the syllogism. When we inquire about the truth of a syllogism, we are asking whether a proposition is true or false. "All men are mortal beings." Is that a true statement? Do you agree? When we inquire about the validity of a syllogism, we are not at all concerned about whether the propositions are true; we are concerned only with whether the inferences are justifiable, whether we can logically draw this conclusion from those premises. All the rules for the syllogism concern the form, the validity, of the syllogism.

    It is extremely important that the student keep this distinction in mind. If he withholds his assent to a conclusion, he must know whether he is objecting to the truth of the premise or the validity of the reasoning. If he detects an invalid argument, he can utterly destroy his opponent's argument in a matter of minutes. If he objects to the truth of a proposition, he has a harder task on his hands, for it may take a long time to demonstrate that his opponent's statement is false. We must be satisfied about both the truth of the premises and the validity of the reasoning before we will give our

    assent to a conclusion. But the peculiar force of a syllogistic argument resides in this: if we assent to the truth of the premises and if we agree that the reasoning is valid, we must grant the conclusion. Under these conditions, rational people cannot resist the conclusion.

    The second point we need to establish is the meaning of the term distri-
    bution. In logic, distribution signifies the full extension of a term to cover
    all the objects or individuals in the class denoted. In the phrase "all men,"
    the term men is said to be distributed because the all designates the total
    number of individuals in the class of men. In the phrase "some men," men
    is undistributed because the some designates something less than the total
    number of individuals in the class. Sometimes we speak of a distributed term
    as being a universal term and of an undistributed term as being a particular
    term.

    In the syllogism, we usually have no difficulty determining whether the
    subject term of propositions is distributed, because the quantity words (all,
    every, no, some, most), if present, will tell us. Since, as we have pointed out,
    most logicians regard a proposition that has a proper name as the subject
    as being a universal proposition ("Socrates is a rational animal"), the proper
    name may be regarded as a distributed term (the predicate applies to the
    entire subject).

    It is a little more difficult to determine—or at least to recognize—whether
    predicate terms are distributed. For the beginning student, it is just as well
    that he use this simple formula:

    1. The predicate terms of all affirmative propositions (all A- or I-
    propositions) are undistributed.

    2. The predicate terms of all negative propositions (all E- or O- prop-
    ositions) are distributed.

    Let us see why this is so. When we assert "All men are mortal beings," it is
    clear that "mortal beings" is predicated of every member of the class of men.
    At the same time, however, we are not saying, "All men are all the mortal
    beings that are." Perhaps this can be clarified with a system of circles. Let
    one circle represent the entire class of men and another circle represent the
    entire class of mortal beings. Now here is a picture of the proposition "All
    men are mortal beings":

    ‘lhe proposition asserts that the entire class of men is "in" the class of mortal
    beings, but as the circles make clear, the class of men does not have as wide
    an extension, does not cover as much area, as the class of mortal beings.
    ‘here are other mortal beings (birds, animals, fish) that are not men. We
    have then made an assertion about the entire class of men but not about the
    entire class of mortal beings. So the term men is distributed, but the term
    mortal beings is undistributed.
    Now here is a picture of the proposition "No men are mortal beings":

    mortal
    beings

    We have asserted that none of the class of men is "in" the class of mortal
    beings: or, to put it another way, the entire class of men is excluded from
    the entire class of mortal beings. Both terms are being used in the widest
    possible extension, and therefore both the subject term and the predicate
    term of an E-proposition are distributed.

    The scheme of circles can also illustrate the distribution of the predicate
    terms in I- and O-propositions:

    |-proposition: O-proposition:

    Some men are mortal beings. Some men are not mortal beings.
    mortal mortal
    beings beings

    In the I-proposition, part of the men circle (the checkmarked area) overlaps
    part of the mortal being circle, and so it is clear that neither the subject term
    nor the predicate term is distributed—in neither case is the entire class in-
    volved. In the O-proposition, part of the men circle (the checkmarked area)
    falls outside the mortal being circle; consequently, the subject term men is
    undistributed (a predication is made about something less than the whole
    class of men), but the predicate term mortal beings is distributed (the "some
    men," represented by the checkmark, is wholly outside the entire class of
    mortal beings).

    Circle diagrams have not clarified this concept, it would be well for the student to rely, until the light strikes him, on the simple formulas that the predicate terms of all affirmative propositions are undistributed and that the predicate terms of all negative propositions are distributed. This matter of distribution is important, because two of the rules for a valid syllogism involve distribution of terms and because many of the fallacies in deductive reasoning are the result of an inference being drawn from undistributed terms.

    We are ready now to look at the rules for a valid syllogism. Remember that these rules concern the form or the logic of the argument, not the truth of the propositions:

    1. There must be three terms and only three terms.

    2. The middle term must be distributed at least once.

    3. No term may be distributed in the conclusion if it was not distributed in the premise.

    Most invalid syllogisms will be detected by the application of these three rules. Occasionally, however, a syllogism will pass the test of these three rules and yet will not be a valid syllogism. So we must add three more rules:

    4. No conclusion may be drawn from two particular (as opposed to universal) premises.

    5. No conclusion may be drawn from two negative premises.

    6. If one of the premises is negative, the conclusion must be negative.

    Let us apply these six rules to our model syllogism and see whether the reasoning is valid. Here is the syllogism again:

    All men are mortal beings.
    Socrates is a man.
    Therefore, Socrates is a mortal being.

    The first rule is that there must be three terms and only three terms. In the
    elementary stages of testing syllogisms, the student must actually count the
    terms. Once he has counted three terms, he may not stop there; he must
    go on to make sure that there are only three terms. In the first proposition,
    there are two terms, men and mortal beings. In the next proposition, there
    are two terms, Socrates and man. Since Socrates is a term clearly distinct
    from the men and mortal beings of the first proposition, we have now deter-
    mined that there are three terms in this syllogism. But we must now go on
    to check that the syllogism has no more than three terms. What about man
    in the second proposition? Is it not a fourth term? Is it not different from
    men in the first proposition? Men does differ grammatically from man,
    being the plural form of the singular noun, but lexically the two terms do
    not differ, since they both have the same referent. Terms are the "same"—
    are univocal, to use the logician's term—if the referent of the terms is
    identical. If, for instance, we substituted He for Socrates in the conclusion,
    we would not be introducing a fourth term into the syllogism because the
    referent or antecedent of He is, presumably, Socrates. (We would, of course,
    be introducing another term if the antecedent of the pronoun were not
    Socrates.) Sometimes in arguing with someone we call for a clarification of
    the ambiguity of pronoun reference. "Who is they?" we ask our opponent,
    just to make sure that he hasn't shifted referents. Likewise we can use syno-
    nyms or periphrasis without introducing a new term. If in the conclusion we
    were to substitute "a man who will die" for mortal being, we would not be
    introducing another term. In such cases, of course, we must be satisfied that
    the synonym or periphrasis means the same as the term for which it is sub-
    stituting.

    What we must be especially on our guard against is the use of the same term with different meanings. To do this is to be guilty of what the logician's call equivocation. Let us look first at an obvious example of equivocation:

    All men have hearts.
    All celery plants have hearts.

    No native speaker of English would be deceived by the shift of meaning in the two uses of the word hearts. The second hearts is clearly a new term. It is subtle shifts of denotation that can trap us. We must be alert enough to catch a subtle shift like this:

    All draftsmen are designing men.
    All politicians are designing men.

    The point might be made here that from the logician's point of view shifts in denotation will result in fallacious reasoning, but that from the rhetorician's point of view shifts in denotation can be used for certain stylistic effects, in which case the audience is aware of both meanings. The pun, the figure of speech that rhetoricians called paronomastia, is an example of this kind of shift in denotation. One of the famous examples of paronomasia was Christ's promise to the chief of his apostles: "Thou art Peter [Greek, petra, rock], and upon this rock I will build my church." Rhetorical effects are also achieved by shifts in the connotation of words. We shall discuss this further in the chapter on style.

    Let us go back now to counting the terms in our model syllogism. We had gone through the two premises and discovered that we had three distinct terms and decided that man in the second premise was not a fourth term. In the conclusion, Socrates is a repetition of a term in the minor premise, and mortal being is a repetition, in singular form, of a term in the major premise. So our model syllogism passes the first test: it has three terms and only three terms.

- prompt: "Now to test the syllogism by the second rule: the middle term must be  \ndistributed at least once. The middle term, we said, was the term that oc-  \ncurred in both premises but not in the conclusion. Our middle term here is  \nmen (man). We must determine whether it is distributed, whether it is used,  \nat least once, to include the whole class. \"All men are mortal beings\" is our  \nmajor premise. The middle term men is distributed. We can tell that it is  \ndistributed by noting the All. Is the middle term distributed in the minor  \npremise, \"Socrates is a man\"? No, it is not; here it is the predicate term of  \nan affirmative proposition, which, as we have said, is never distributed.

Socrates is distributed in the conclusion, but  \nSocrates is also distributed in the premise; hence our third rule is satisfied.  \nThe predicate term (mortal being) of the conclusion is undistributed (re-  \nmember, the predicate term of affirmative propositions is undistributed).

    Our model syllogism has passed the test of the first three rules, and gen-
    erally this indicates that the reasoning is valid. But, just to be sure, we have
    to apply the fourth, fifth, and sixth rules. We can do that hurriedly. The
    fourth rule is that no conclusion may be drawn from two particular prem-
    ises. Both of the premises in our model syllogism are universals. The fifth
    and sixth rules do not apply at all because neither of the premises is negative.

    So the reasoning in our model syllogism is unshakably valid. We are sat-
    isfied about the form of the argument. Now before we assent to the conclu-
    sion, we must be satisfied about the matter of the argument—that is, about
    the truth of the premises. Is it true that all men are mortal, that all men are
    destined to die? Do we agree that Socrates is a man, that Socrates is a species
    of the genus man? If we answer "yes" to both of those questions, we must
    grant the conclusion.

    THE APPEAL TO REASON = 57

    If, on the other hand, we deny the truth of either premise, we will have
    to settle down to demonstrating that the premise is false or to listening to
    our opponent's arguments that the premise is true. Arguments about the
    truth of premises can go on for a long time and even then not be settled.
    Usually, arguments that go on and on are arguments about the truth or
    falsity of propositions. Even those arguments that are stalemated by the lack
    of agreement about the definition of terms are arguments about the matter
    and not about the form of the argument. Whenever it can be shown that the
    mode of arguing is illogical, the dispute can be settled very quickly. The
    rules for a valid syllogism were derived inductively from a study of the way
    in which the human mind reasons, and no one has successfully challenged
    the validity of these rules. Even one who has no formal training in logic and
    its technical terminology can be shown very quickly, in layman's terms, that
    his reasoning is invalid, if it is.

- prompt: "Once the student has been instructed about the form, the terminology, and  \nthe rules for the syllogism, it is simply a matter of practice with sample syl-  \nlogisms before he acquires a proficiency in detecting fallacies in deductive  \nreasoning. A number of syllogisms have been provided in the exercises im-  \nmediately following this section. In the beginning stages, the student may  \nhave to apply the rules, one by one, in a mechanical fashion. After he has  \nhad some practice in dealing with syllogisms, he will be able to tell at a  \nylance whether the syllogism is valid or not. For instance, any time he finds  \n\nsyllogism taking this form, he will detect the Fallacy of the Undistributed  \nMiddle:\n\nAll A is B.  \nAll C is B.  \n-. All C is A.  \n\nWhenever the middle term (B) is the predicate term of two afhrmative  \npremises, the middle term will be undistributed, and consequently no con-  \nclusion can logically follow from those premises.  \n\nSince the arguments based on the topic of antecedent and consequent often  \ntke the form of a hypothetical or conditional proposition, we should con-  \nsider the principles that govern validity of reasoning in the hypothetical syl-  \nlogism. When we argue in the form of a hypothetical proposition, we are  \nproposing that the truth of the antecedent (the zf clause) implies the truth  \nof the consequent (the main clause). So we say, \"If he has leukemia, he will  \ndie.\" The truth of the consequent, however, does not necessarily imply the  \ntruth of the antecedent: \"If he dies, he has leukemia\" is not necessarily true.  \n\nIf we construct a deductive argument from the hypothetical proposition,  \nwe can detect, from another angle, that the truth of the antecedent does not  \nfollow from the truth of the consequent. First let us look at a valid deductive  \nargument:  \n\n1. If he has leukemia, he will die.  \nHe has leukemia.  \nTherefore, he will die. (VALID)  \n\nHere the second premise affirms that the antecedent is true. If it is confirmed  \nthat a man has leukemia and if everyone afflicted with leukemia invariably  \ndies, then it logically follows that this man will die.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

    Now let us see what happens to the validity of the argument when the second premise affirms the consequent:

    2. If he has leukemia, he will die.
    He will die.
    Therefore, he has leukemia. (INVALID)

    Confronted with this argument, most of us would be prompted to say, "Some- how I don't feel that the conclusion follows from the premise." Our feeling about the conclusion would be right. A logician labels this form of argument "the fallacy of affirming the consequent." Common sense tells us that from this sequence of propositions one may not validly infer that the man has leukemia from the affirmation that the man is going to die. .

    If the consequent is denied, a valid conclusion may be drawn. We can use the same sort of propositions to illustrate this form of argument:

    3. If he has leukemia, he will die.
    He will not die.
    Therefore, he does not have leukemia. (VALID)

    The validity of this conclusion may not be immediately apparent, but if we reflect a moment on what the premises say, we are forced to agree to the conclusion. If a man afflicted with leukemia inevitably dies and if a doctor affirms that this man is not in apparent danger of death, the one thing we can assert definitely is that this man does not now have leukemia.

    Let us look at an example of "the fallacy of denying the antecedent":

    4. If he has leukemia, he will die.
    He does not have leukemia.

    Therefore, he will not die. (INVALID)

    Common sense tells us that even if both premises are true, the conclusion does not follow, because we recognize that a man could die from something other than leukemia.

    THE APPEAL TO REASON 59

    Here is a simple table of criteria for testing the validity of hypothetical syllogisms:

    If the minor premise (that is, the second premise)

    (1) affirms the antecedent—the conclusion is valid (see syllogism 1 above)

    (2) affirms the consequent—the conclusion is invalid (see syllogism 2)

    (3) denies the consequent—the conclusion is valid (see syllogism 3)

    (4) denies the antecedent—the conclusion is invalid (see syllogism 4)

    Since arguments based on the topic of contradiction sometimes take the form of "either/or," or disjunctive, propositions, we might take a look at some of the principles governing this kind of deductive reasoning.

    The issue in an argument might take this form: "Either he committed the murder, or he did not commit the murder." We recognize that these are the only two possibilities. Therefore, if one of the possibilities is disproved, the other one must be true. As anyone knows who has witnessed a fictional or real-life courtroom drama, it sometimes takes a protracted trial to prove or disprove one of the alternatives posed in our sample disjunctive proposition. But once we have proved one of the alternatives to be true, we automatically prove the other to be false.

    In setting up the disjunctive proposition, however, we must take care to set up mutually exclusive alternatives. The proposition "He is either a student or a teacher" has the form of a disjunctive proposition, but the alternatives, the matter of the disjunctive statement, are not mutually exclusive. For he could be a teacher and a student in any one period. However, if we were to say, "Either he is a teacher, or he is not a teacher," we have set up mutually exclusive alternatives, for being a teacher and not being a teacher are the only two possibilities in this instance.

    EXERCISE

    Test the following syllogisms for validity. Wherever necessary, convert the propositions into the form of substantive terms on both sides of a copulative verb. Where no quantity word is expressed, presume that All precedes the subject term if the proposition is affirmative or that No precedes the subject term if the proposition is negative—e.g. Men are not happy > No men are happy people. Since the student should not be at all concerned with the truth
    of the propositions when he is testing a syllogism for validity, nonsense words or symbols will occasionally be used for the terms of the propositions.

    Some freshmen are out-of-state students.
    Therefore, some freshmen are taxpayers.

    THE ENTHYMEME

    Our treatment of the categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive syllogisms
    was sketchy, but all the fundamentals were touched on. These fundamental
    principles should provide us with sufficient guidance for the construction or
    analysis of deductive reasoning according to the laws of formal logic. We
    have by no means exhausted all the facets and complexities of Aristotelian
    or scholastic logic, nor have we touched on symbolic logic, which has devel-
    oped from the mathematical studies of men like Gottlob Frege, Alfred North
    Whitehead, and Bertrand Russell and from studies in semantics by men like
    C. K. Ogden, I. A. Richards, and Alfred Korzybski. But our primary con-
    cern is with rhetoric, and we can linger in the province of logic only long
    enough to gather some useful basic principles.

    We turn now to a consideration of the enthymeme, which is the rhetorical
    equivalent of the syllogism. In modern times, the enthymeme has come to
    be regarded as an abbreviated syllogism—that is, an argumentative statement
    that contains a conclusion and one of the premises, the second premise being
    implied. A statement like this would be regarded as an enthymeme: "He
    must be a socialist because he favors a graduated income-tax." Here the con-
    clusion (He is a socialist) has been deduced from an expressed premise (he
    favors a graduated income-tax) and an implied premise (Anyone who favors
    a graduated income-tax is a socialist). Incidentally, the student who has de-
    veloped some skill in analyzing the validity of syllogisms will detect here
    the fallacy of the undistributed middle term.

- prompt: |-
    The modern notion of the enthymeme as a truncated syllogism is probably
    implicit in Aristotle's statement, "The enthymeme must consist of few propo-
    sitions, fewer often than those which make up normal syllogism" (Rhetoric,
    I, 2). But according to what Aristotle said in the Prior Analytics (Bk. II,
    Ch. 27), the essential difference is that the syllogism leads to a necessary
    conclusion from universally true premises but the enthymeme leads to a
    tentative conclusion from probable premises. In dealing with contingent.
    human affairs, we cannot always discover or confirm what is the truth. Think
    of how difficult it often is to prove that the defendant is guilty of the crime
    with which he is charged; how much more difficult it is to prove the wisdom
    or advantage of a future course of action—for instance, that a proposed tax
    cut will contribute to the general prosperity of the country. But frequently,
    in the interests of getting on with the business of life, we have to make de-
    cisions on the basis of uncertainties or probabilities. The function of rhetoric
    is to persuade, where it cannot convince, an audience. And in matters where
    the truth cannot be readily ascertained, rhetoric can persuade an audience to
    adopt a point of view or a course of action on the basis of the merely prob-
    able—that is, on the basis of what usually happens or what people believe to
    be capable of happening.

    We can illustrate the difference by looking at a syllogism and an enthy-
    meme. Our model syllogism is a good example of the kind of deductive
    reasoning that can lead to an irresistible conclusion. The major premise of
    that syllogism—"All men are mortal"—states a universal truth. Both history
    and the evidence of our own senses tell us that all men must die. The minor
    premise—"Socrates is a man"—is a truth that can be unmistakably verified.
    From these two "truths" then we can arrive at the infallible conclusion that
    Socrates too will die.

    But suppose someone argues this way: "John will fail his examination because he hasn't studied." Here we have an enthymeme, both in the sense of a truncated syllogism and in the sense of a deductive argument based on probable premises. The truth of the minor premise here—"John hasn't studied"—could be confirmed. The probable premise resides in the unexpressed proposition—"Anyone who doesn't study will fail his examination." We all know that the latter proposition is not universally true. But we also know that those who do not study usually fail their examinations. It is, in other words, probable that those who do not study will fail. For all practical purposes, that probability is enough to persuade us that next week we will see John's name on the Dean's list of failures.

    Aristotle was shrewd enough to see that we base persuasive arguments not only on what usually or generally happens but also on what people believe to be true. For that reason, the man who seeks to persuade a select audience must apprise himself of the generally held opinions of that group. If it is known, for instance, that a certain group of people believe that the Fire God causes the rainfall, someone could use that received opinion to persuade his audience that it is their failure to propitiate the Fire God that is responsible for the protracted drought. Every civilization has a body of accepted opinions that influence the conduct of its affairs—a body of "truths" which have never really been demonstrated but in which the people have faith, almost to the point of accepting them as self-evident.

    The enthymeme then—"a kind of syllogism," as Aristotle puts it—is the instrument of deductive reasoning peculiar to the art of rhetoric. It often suppresses some of the links in the chain of argument because the audience is impatient with, or incapable of attending to, the kind of closely reasoned, full-scale argument associated with formal logic. And the audience can be satisfied with probable conclusions because it recognizes the contingent nature of the things that rhetoric deals with.

    Since the enthymeme partakes of the nature of the syllogism, its mode of
    inference is similar to that of the syllogism. One of the premises may be
    missing, but the missing premise is as readily supplied as the missing parts
    of an elliptical grammatical structure. When we are seeking to refute some-
    one else's enthymeme, it may be the missing premise that we should attack,
    because the implied proposition may be the vulnerable spot in the other
    person's argument.

    For instance, take the enthymeme, "He must be a Communist because he
    advocates civil rights for minority groups." We cannot really judge the valid-
    ity of the conclusion ("He must be a Communist") until we look at the
    implied premise. We might sense that the conclusion is unwarranted, but
    until we exposed the implied proposition, we could not demonstrate that the
    conclusion was unwarranted. We cannot determine, in other words, whether
    64 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    the conclusion follows logically until we study the conclusion in relation
    to the expressed premise and the implied premise.

    What is the implied premise in this instance? In the discussion of the
    syllogism, we said that if we can determine which proposition in a deductive
    argument is the conclusion we can reconstruct the full syllogism. The minor
    term, we learned, is the subject of the conclusion; the major term is the
    predicate of the conclusion. Since "he" is the subject term of the conclusion,
    we know that the expressed premise (he advocates civil rights for minority
    groups) is the minor premise of the full syllogism. We also know that the
    major premise of the full syllogism will contain the predicate term of the
    conclusion ("a Communist"). But although we know that the implied prem-
    ise will contain this term, we do not know for sure whether this major term
    is the subject term of the major premise or the predicate term of the major
    premise. The implied premise could take either of these forms:

    All Communists are advocates of civil rights for minority groups.
    All advocates of civil rights for minority groups are Communists.

    It is important that we be able to determine which form the implied premise takes, because until we do so, we cannot determine whether and where the argument is vulnerable. If the person who advanced the enthymeme meant to imply that "all Communists advocate civil rights for minority groups," we would not have to spend our time discussing whether that proposition was true; we could very quickly point out that this argument is invalid because the middle term ("advocates of civil rights"), being the predicate term of two affirmative propositions, is undistributed. If our opponent did not understand what it meant to say that a term was "undistributed," we could point out to him that his argument had not established that only Communists advocate civil rights for minority groups. At bottom, this is the fallacy behind all assertions of guilt by association.

    If, on the other hand, the implied premise is "All advocates of civil rights for minority groups are Communists," the reasoning will be valid, because now the middle term is distributed ("All advocates"). Hence we can impugn only the truth of the implied proposition. Is it true that anyone who advocates civil rights is a Communist? Whether we judged this proposition from the viewpoint of what is necessarily true (the province of strict logic) or from the viewpoint of what is probably true (the province of rhetoric), we would have to deny that this proposition is true. So although the argument in this case is valid, we would not grant the conclusion because the implied premise is patently false.

    Aristotle said that the materials of enthymemes are probabilities and signs. We have already treated of the probable propositions, which constitute the premises of an enthymeme and which constitute, in Aristotle's eyes, the essential

    The key distinction between enthymemes and syllogisms. A sign is an indication or concomitant of something else; it may occur before or simultaneously with or after something else. Smoke, for instance, is a sign of fire; lightning is a sign that thunder is about to rumble; thunder is a sign that lightning has flashed. A sign is not a cause or reason for something else happening; it is merely an indication that something has happened, is happening, or will happen. Signs, like probabilities, can constitute the premises of an enthymeme.

    Aristotle distinguished two kinds of signs that figure in an enthymeme—infallible and fallible. An infallible sign is that which invariably accompanies something else. It is said, for instance, that smoke invariably accompanies fire. Accordingly, whenever we see smoke or smell smoke we conclude that there is a fire someplace. And if it was really smoke we saw or smelled, there will of course be a fire someplace. Now, what makes a conclusion drawn from this kind of sign infallible is not only that smoke invariably accompanies fire but that smoke accompanies fire exclusively. If what we commonly know as smoke sometimes accompanied something else besides fire, we could not conclude infallibly that the presence of smoke was a sign of the presence of fire.

    If a sign does not invariably and exclusively accompany something else, it is fallible—that is, any conclusion drawn from a sign of this kind will always be open to refutation. For instance, fast breathing is often a sign that a man has a fever. But because fast breathing does not always accompany a fever and because fast breathing sometimes attends other physical conditions, we cannot conclude infallibly that a man has a fever from the fact that he breathes rapidly. The condition of fast breathing would justify us in concluding that the man probably has a fever, but no more than that. The probability of his having a fever increases, of course, if the fast breathing is accompanied by other signs or symptoms of fever—high temperature, flushed cheeks.

    Circumstantial evidence in a court trial is usually based on a series of fallible signs. The prosecuting lawyer reminds the jury of a number of suspicious circumstances: the accused was discovered with blood on his coat; his lights were badly scratched; his shirt was torn; there was an ugly purplish bruise on his skin. "Are these not signs," the prosecutor asks the jury, "of a fierce physical struggle?" The prosecutor hopes that the jury mentally answers "yes" to his rhetorical question. Circumstantial evidence can never prove absolutely that a man is guilty, and for this reason many states will not allow the death penalty to be imposed on a man convicted by this evidence alone. But circumstantial evidence, especially when it has acquired cumulative force from the citation of a large number of incriminating particulars, can have great persuasive power with a jury.

    66 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    So the rhetorician will use infallible signs for his enthymemes whenever such signs are available to him. But he will also use fallible signs, because he knows that they can have persuasive force. He will remain aware, however, that arguments built upon fallible signs are always open to challenge. Fallible signs are like analogies: they never prove, but they can persuade.

    Let us stress again two points about the use of the rhetorical enthymeme:
    (1) it is important to ascertain the implied premise of an enthymeme, because the implied premise or assumption may be the vulnerable spot in the argument; (2) the probable propositions and the fallible signs used in rhetorical enthymemes do not lead to necessarily and universally true conclusions, but they can be effectively persuasive.

    How may the student recognize an enthymeme when he meets one in ordinary discourse? Fortunately, enthymemes assume a fairly common syntactic pattern accompanied by a limited number of function words. Enthymes often take the form of a compound sentence, the two clauses being joined by coordinating conjunctions for or so or linked logically by such conjunctive adverbs as therefore, hence, consequently; or they take the form of a complex sentence, the clauses being joined by such subordinating conjunctions as since or because.

    Let us illustrate the syntactic form of the enthymeme by taking two propositions and linking them grammatically in a variety of ways to form an enthymeme. These are the two propositions:

    John Smith would not make a good governor. He has Communist leanings.

    These two independent clauses, juxtaposed paratactically, could constitute an enthymeme. The context in which those two sentences occurred might suggest to the hearer or reader a logical relationship between the two statements: the second statement gives the grounds for the first assertion. An alert, sophisticated audience will readily detect the connection between these two statements. Rather than rely on the implied relationship, however, most speakers or writers will tie the two statements together explicitly. Note the various ways in which they could do this:

    John Smith would not make a good governor, for he has Communist leanings.
    because he has Communist
    leanings.
    since he has Communist lean-
    ings.

    John Smith has Communist leanings, so he would not make a good governor.
    THE APPEAL TO REASON 67

    John Smith has Communist leanings; therefore he would not make a good
    governor.
    consequently he would not make a good
    governor.
    hence he would not make a good gov-
    ernor.

    But not every sentence employing linking words like for, because, and therefore will constitute an enthymeme. Take, for instance, a statement like this: He didn't go to the lecture last night, because he had a headache. Here the because-clause merely gives a reason for his not going to the lecture; it is not a premise from which the conclusion is deduced. If we link the first statement with a different statement, however, we will have an enthymeme: He didn't go to the lecture last night, so he must differ ideologically with the guest speaker. Now the first statement becomes the ground or the premise for the inference stated in the second clause.

    Sometimes there will be an ambiguity about the relationship of the clauses. Take this statement, for instance: He did not kill his mother because he loved her. What is the import of this statement? Is this statement merely denying the reason given for the murder? It may mean something like this: he did not kill his mother because he loved her and wanted to relieve her of any further agony from her incurable disease; no, he killed her because he wanted to collect on her insurance. Or it may mean this: he loved his mother; therefore it is ridiculous to suggest that he killed her. If the statement means the latter, we would have a true enthymeme. The import of the statement depends upon whether the because-clause is restrictive or non-restrictive. If the clause is restrictive, we are denying the reason alleged for the crime. If the clause is non-restrictive, we are stating a premise upon which we have based our conclusion that he did not murder his mother. If we were speaking this sentence, we would indicate whether the clause was restrictive or non-restrictive (and therefore the import of the entire statement) by some phonemic device of intonation. If we were writing that sentence, we could clarify the meaning by one of two courses: (1) recasting the sentence to remove the ambiguity; (2) putting a comma before because if the clause is non-restrictive or leaving the comma out if the clause is restrictive. Unless we wanted the statement to be ambiguous, it would probably be better to reword the sentence so that our meaning would be clear.

    Speakers and writers will sometimes deliberately leave statements of this kind ambiguous. They sometimes seek to discredit someone by innuendo. If they render the relationship between statements vague, they may trap the audience into accepting an implication that is unwarranted by the facts. We must be alert enough to detect such chicanery and scrupulous enough not to employ such devious means ourselves. This is not to deny that ambiguity can be an effective and legitimate literary device, as in a poem, for instance.

    THE EXAMPLE

    All knowledge is acquired and all proof is achieved through either deduction or induction. The syllogism is the formal device that Aristotle invented to analyze and systematize deductive reasoning. The enthymeme, as we have just seen, is a kind of imperfect syllogism, which produces, not the conclusive demonstration that we get in science and logic, but belief or persuasion.

    Just as deductive reasoning has its rhetorical equivalent in the enthymeme, so inductive reasoning has its rhetorical equivalent in the example. In induction we proceed from the particular to the general. Hence in a scientific demonstration or in logic we arrive inductively at a generalization through observation of a series of particulars. The validity and truth of the generalization will be in direct proportion to the number of pertinent particulars studied. The generalization, "Women are more careful drivers than men," will be "truer" and will be more validly derived if it was based on a study of the driving habits of a million men and women than if it was based on a study of only 100,000 men and women—presuming, of course, that the same criteria for carefulness were used in both studies.

- prompt: |-
    The reason for the greater reliability of the generalization made from a number of instances is that there is less of an "inductive leap." Both deduction and induction make use of inference. The difference is that deduction makes inferences from statements, while induction makes inferences from verifiable phenomena. Induction leaps from known, observed facts, over an area of unknown, unobserved instances, to a generalization. The more facts or instances that are observed, the narrower will be the gap of the unknown that has to be leaped and accordingly the more reliable will be the generalization.

    Aristotle realized that an orator addressing an audience could not adduce a whole series of particular instances to substantiate his generalization. A scientist of course must offer the supporting evidence of hundreds, even thousands, of experiments if he is to convince his colleagues of the validity of his generalization. But an orator has only a limited amount of time, and a writer has only a limited amount of space, to present their case to an audience, and they cannot risk boring their audience with an exhaustive catalogue of supporting evidence. Normally they will offer only one or two cogent examples to support their generalizations.

    Let us illustrate the use of the rhetorical example by imagining the kind of argument that a senator might employ in trying to persuade his colleagues not to declare war against a neighboring country. The point that he wants to make, the generalization that he seeks to establish, is that waging war against a neighbor will prove disastrous for the country initiating the war. If he had time, he could recite from world history dozens of instances of how wars waged against neighbors proved to be disadvantageous to the country precipitating the conflict. Instead he cites a single example, analogous to the present situation, preferably one from American history and recent enough to be impressive. He might, for instance, cite the example of the Spanish-American War or the Mexican War. We can imagine his saying something like this:

    Look, it's true that we won this war, but consider the price we paid for waging war on a neighboring country. We disrupted our economy by ex-
    pending millions of dollars to finance the invasion. We sent ten thousand young men to an early death, at a time when the labor market at home
    was ominously sparse. Millions of dollars worth of American property was damaged or destroyed. Besides, we alienated the good will of the
    dominant European powers. And instead of retaining an unaggrieved buffer state on our southern border, we produced at our threshold a hos-
    tile, vindictive nation that at the first opportunity would gladly enter into an alliance with any major power that sought to invade us. The price we
    paid for that war far exceeded the benefits we reaped. Gentlemen, I tell you that a war now against neighboring would have equally disas-
    trous consequences.

    One of the strategies open to those senators who advocate going to war
    against the neighboring country would be to offer examples of other wars
    waged against neighbors which did not prove disastrous for the aggressor.
    Many considerations would determine which of these conflicting examples
    would produce more belief in the audience, but one of the considerations
    certainly would be the degree of similarity in the past and present situations.

    An argument by example does not really prove anything, for like the
    rhetorical enthymeme, the example leads, most of the time, to a mere prob-
    ability. But because a probability is what usually happens or what is believed
    (to happen, the example has persuasive value. The example, of course, is
    always exposed to challenge and refutation. The opposition can counter with
    the reminder that on the grounds of strict logic a single example does not
    prove anything—no more than a single swallow makes a summer. Another
    way for the opposition to counteract the persuasive force of the example is,
    is we have pointed out, to cite another similar example where the outcome
    Wats just the opposite of the one cited. In such cases, the issue will be decided
    by a complex of attendant considerations: (1) the relative impressiveness
    and pertinence of the conflicting examples; (2) the persuasiveness of the
    other arguments offered in support of the contention; (3) the persuasiveness
    of the styles of the discourses; (4) the "ethical appeal" of the two men offer-
    ing examples; (5) the force of the "emotional appeals"; (6) the emotional
    climate of the times.

    THE FALLACIES

    Before we quit this section on the logical modes of appeal, we should con-
    sider, at least briefly, the common fallacies in deductive and inductive reason-
    ing. An awareness of these fallacies can be of help to us when we are seeking
    to refute arguments that oppose the position we maintain, and it can also
    prevent us from indulging in specious reasoning in our own discourses.

    In common parlance, the word fallacy has two meanings: (1) a false, er-
    roneous statement, an untruth; (2) invalid, specious, or deceptive reasoning.
    The first of these meanings has to do with the matter of the argument; the
    second, with the form or mode of argument. Formal logic is concerned
    primarily, although not exclusively, with the form of argument, but since
    fallacy denotes for most people a "false statement," we should say a few
    words about fallacious matter.

    Fallacies of Matter

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical Appeal and Fallacy Recognition**\n\nEvaluate the following argument: "A recent study found that 90% of people who consumed a new type of energy drink reported increased alertness. Therefore, this energy drink is the best solution for combating fatigue."\n- **Step 1**: Identify which logical appeal (ethos, pathos, logos) is being used in this argument.\n- **Step 2**: Determine if there are any fallacies present in the reasoning. If so, explain which type of fallacy (e.g., hasty generalization, false cause) is being committed.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a counterargument that addresses the potential fallacy while maintaining the original conclusion.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both logical appeals and fallacies, and your counterargument should logically refute the original argument''s flaw without contradicting its conclusion.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Fallacious Matter in Rhetorical Arguments**\n\nConsider the following argument: "We should not allow students to use calculators during exams because it would give them an unfair advantage. However, in the real world, people use calculators every day to solve complex problems."\n- **Step 1**: Identify the fallacy in this argument and explain why it is logically flawed.\n- **Step 2**: Refute the fallacy by addressing the contradiction in the argument''s reasoning.\n- **Step 3**: Suggest a revised version of the argument that avoids the fallacy while still expressing the original concern.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must connect the argument''s structure to the definitions of fallacies in the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of how to correct logical errors.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Evaluation of Fallacy Types in Everyday Arguments**\n\nAnalyze the following statement: "This product is the best because it''s been recommended by a celebrity."\n- **Step 1**: Determine which fallacy is being committed and justify your answer using the text''s definitions.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how this fallacy is different from a valid appeal to authority.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example of a valid appeal to authority that would not be considered a fallacy.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of fallacies and logical appeals, showing a clear distinction between valid and invalid reasoning in arguments.'

    A false statement can be detected and refuted only if one knows what the truth is. The claim that the earth was the center of our solar system was not detected as a falsehood until Copernicus discovered the corrective fact: that the sun was the center of our universe. We may suspect a statement—as Copernicus must have suspected the Ptolemaic view of the universe—but we cannot disprove the statement until we have discovered the facts. One of the cardinal principles of argument is that the burden of proof rests upon the one who challenges the generally accepted view of things. Since most astronomers hold that human life as we know it does not exist on the other planets in our solar system—in other words, since the testimony of experts concurs—the burden of proof that there is life on these other planets rests on those who make the counterclaim. Man's exploration of outer space may turn up the "facts" that will either confirm or correct the generally received view.

    Since truth is the only corrective of falsity, it is extremely important that all of us learn, through experience or education, as many facts about our world as are necessary for our effective and purposeful existence, or at least learn how and where to acquire facts. The man of inferior or inadequate knowledge will always be at a disadvantage in his dealings with other men. How often all of us have been frustrated in an argument by having to admit, "I can't discredit your assertion because at the moment I don't know the facts." If in the course of an argument about the rate of economic growth someone makes the telling point that at least a third of the families in the country have a total annual income of less than $2000, we cannot discredit that claim by saying simply, "That's not so." We can call for and challenge the source of a man's information, but we will most effectively undermine an assertion by adducing evidence that a claim is false. The next best thing to having the refutative information at our fingertips is to know where we might find the facts that will discredit our opponent's statement.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Evaluating the Burden of Proof in Scientific Claims**\n\nThe text discusses how the burden of proof lies with those making a counterclaim. Using examples from the passage, explain:\n- **Part A**: Why Copernicus was unable to disprove the Ptolemaic view until he discovered that the sun was the center of the universe.\n- **Part B**: How does this principle apply to modern scientific debates, such as the claim that life exists on other planets?\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of this principle for everyday arguments, such as debates about economic growth.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate understanding of the burden of proof principle and its application to scientific, economic, and everyday contexts. Use specific examples from the text to support your reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**The Role of Evidence in Discrediting Claims**\n\nThe text emphasizes that the most effective way to undermine an assertion is by providing evidence that it is false. Using the passage, answer:\n- **Part A**: Why can''t we simply say ''That''s not so'' when confronted with a claim?\n- **Part B**: How does the ability to call for the source of information relate to the principle of burden of proof?\n- **Part C**: What are two examples from the text that illustrate how knowing where to find facts is essential for effective argumentation?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion on evidence, sources of information, and the burden of proof. Provide clear examples from the text to support your reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**The Importance of Knowledge in Argumentation**\n\nThe text argues that knowledge is essential for effective argumentation and the correction of falsity. Using the passage, explain:\n- **Part A**: Why is it important to learn as many facts as possible for our effective existence?\n- **Part B**: How does the text use the example of Copernicus to illustrate the consequences of inadequate knowledge?\n- **Part C**: What is the author''s main argument about the role of education in acquiring facts?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s central message about knowledge, education, and argumentation. Use specific examples from the passage to support your reasoning.'

    One point needs to be made very strongly here: mere assertion, on either side of an argument, does not constitute proof. It is amazing how often argument is conducted solely with assertions and counterassertions. Conducting an argument in this fashion is like two young boys standing toe to toe and shouting at one another, "My pa can lick your pa," "No, he can't," "Yes, he can," "Oh, yeah!" An argument like this gets nowhere, but a surprising number of people seem to think that it does. (Just take a look at the letters-to-the-editor column of your local newspaper.)

    This is not to say that every time we make a categorical statement we need to substantiate our statement. There are some statements that most men regard as being self-evident—e.g. a whole is equal to the sum of all of its parts. The writers of the Declaration of Independence made some statements in the opening paragraphs of that document that they asserted were self-evident: "that all men are created equal," "that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights." A self-evident proposition has been defined as a statement that all men or most men would immediately accept once they understand the terms of the statement. Being self-evident, such statements do not have to be proved.

    Another kind of statement that normally does not have to be proved is the statement regarded as "true by definition": "Two plus two equals four"; "Democracy is government of the people, by the people, and for the people"; "A majority in any plurality in excess of 50 per cent of the total number." Such statements are "true" in the sense that a consensus has defined them. Sometime in the future, consensus could establish that a majority was a plurality of 60 per cent of the total number. Most laws and statutes, for instance, can be regarded as "true by definition."

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Argumentation in Rhetoric**\n\nEvaluate the analogy presented by the author comparing argumentation to two boys shouting at each other. What is the primary flaw in this analogy according to the text?\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key components of the analogy (the boys, their fathers, the shouting).\n- **Step 2**: Relate these components to the author''s critique of argumentation.\n- **Step 3**: Explain why this analogy fails to capture the essence of a proper argument, using definitions from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the author''s intended meaning and clearly articulate why the analogy is insufficient as a model for effective argumentation.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Distinguishing Self-Evident Propositions and Definitions**\n\nExplain the difference between a self-evident proposition and a statement that is ''true by definition'' according to the text.\n- **Part A**: Provide an example of each, using the examples given in the text (e.g., ''Two plus two equals four'' for ''true by definition'').\n- **Part B**: Analyze the Declaration of Independence''s opening statements in terms of their categorization (self-evident or true by definition).\n- **Part C**: Construct a scenario where a statement could be both self-evident and ''true by definition,'' using the text''s definitions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly differentiate the two concepts and provide a concrete example that aligns with the text''s explanation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Evaluating Legal and Rhetorical Definitions**\n\nThe text states that laws and statutes can be regarded as ''true by definition.'' Create a hypothetical legal scenario where this could apply, and analyze the implications of defining ''majority'' as a ''plurality in excess of 50 per cent of the total number.''\n- **Part A**: Describe a situation where such a definition might be used in legislation.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the text''s discussion on definitions relates to the concept of consensus in legal systems.\n- **Part C**: Question the validity of changing the definition of ''majority'' to a higher percentage (e.g., 60 per cent) based on the text''s explanation of ''true by definition.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the text''s discussion on definitions and demonstrate an understanding of their role in legal and rhetorical contexts.'

    The third kind of statement that does not demand proof is the statement about matters that even the minimally informed person should know: "There are fifty states in the United States"; "All wage-earning adults in America must file an income-tax report once a year"; "A vast body of water separates North America from Europe." The nature of the subject matter and the composition of the audience will largely determine which statements of this kind need to be substantiated. Many statements about physics that might need to be substantiated for an audience of laymen would not have to be proved for an audience of physicists.

    Nor should we demand more precision and accuracy in statements than the occasion demands. When our opponent claims that "150,000 home owners defaulted on their mortgage payments last year," we make ourselves appear silly by countering, "According to the Government Bureau of Statistics only 146,987 home owners defaulted on their mortgage payments last year." A corrective statement like this is mere punctilio and does nothing to advance our own argument or to weaken our opponent's argument. There are occasions, of course, when strict accuracy should be insisted on. When someone, in order to advance his argument, claims that the successful candidate for the office of the President received a clear majority of the electoral votes, it might be useful for our purposes to point out that the successful candidate had a margin of only 345,330 votes, a bare 0.1 per cent of the total popular vote, and that therefore he did not receive an overwhelming mandate from the people.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Ethical Considerations in Argumentation**\n\nConsider the author''s stance on the ethical implications of demanding excessive precision in statements.\n- **Part A**: Summarize the author''s main point about when strict accuracy is justified in arguments.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the example of the presidential election where the author points out the margin of victory. How does this relate to the ethical responsibility of arguers in public discourse?\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument that addresses the balance between precision and ethical responsibility in a debate on climate change, using at least two specific examples from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reflect an analytical understanding of the author''s ethical framework in argumentation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Strategies**\n\nSynthesize the author''s perspective on accuracy, precision, and argumentation in a practical scenario.\n- **Part A**: Create a hypothetical situation where an arguer might be required to use precise statistics to support their claim.\n- **Part B**: Explain the difference between ''punctilio'' and ''strict accuracy'' as defined in the text, using examples from both the author''s discussion and your own knowledge.\n- **Part C**: Develop a response to an argument that states ''The average American earns $50,000 per year,'' based on the author''s principles of rhetorical precision.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the author''s rhetorical strategies and their application in real-world argumentation.'

    Beware also of the fallacy of the half-truth, which can be a particularly
    vicious but surprisingly effective tactic in argument. In the half-truth every-
    thing that is said is true, that is, verifiable as a fact; but because not enough
    is said, the total picture is distorted. Such omission of details conceals or
    distorts the context of a situation. Imagine someone seeking to impugn the
    loyalty of a nuclear scientist with a narrative like this: "For years Professor
    X carried on an active correspondence with top Soviet scientists. He sub-
    scribed to at least six Russian scientific journals. In 1956 he was observed
    having lunch in a New York restaurant with four Soviet scientists. In 1958
    he took a trip to Moscow. A strange pattern of affinity with Soviet ideology,
    is it not?" Professor X did, and would admit that he did, everything ascribed
    to him here; but he would not admit the implications drawn from these
    facts. He would not admit the implications because a number of relevant
    facts that would put his relationship with Soviet scientists in the proper
    perspective have been omitted. He did correspond with Soviet scientists, but
    all of these letters were cleared by the State Department. He did subscribe
    to six Russian journals, but every scholar who wanted to keep up on the
    developments in science had to read the periodical literature from other
    countries. He did have lunch with four Russian scientists, but also present
    at that luncheon were four other American physicists, including Professor Y,
    whose loyalty no one called into question. The trip he took to Moscow in
    1958 was sponsored by the Atomic Energy Commission after he had been
    cleared by an intensive investigation by the FBI.

    This is a bald example of the fallacy of the half-truth, but its very obvious-
    ness helps to illustrate how more subtle examples of this fallacy operate. It
    shows how what is left unsaid can distort the total picture. It is for this
    reason that witnesses in court are made to swear that they will tell "the
    whole truth and nothing but the truth."

    Do more here than lay down the general cautions and principles in regard to fallacies of matter. Each statement of a purported fact must be examined on its own terms and in its own context. The falsity of a statement—if the statement is false—can be detected and exposed only by one's knowledge of the facts. Mere assertion does not constitute proof, but not every statement needs to be substantiated. Nor should punctilious accuracy be insisted on where such precision is irrelevant or inconsequential. We should, however, bear in mind that by indulging in the half-truth we can, paradoxically, tell lies by speaking "nothing but the truth."

    **Fallacies of Reasoning**

    All fallacies of reasoning, whether inductive or deductive, could be classified as non sequiturs—that is, as conclusions or generalizations that "do not follow" from the premises. A logical fallacy is, at bottom, an instance of incoherence—the chain of reasoning does not link together.

    Since we have dealt at length in previous sections with inductive and deductive non sequiturs, we will here merely list the fallacies, with a minimum of comment and with cross references to the sections where these fallacies have been elaborated on.

    **A. Fallacies of Reasoning in Deduction**

    1. **Equivocation**: This is the fallacy of using the same term with two or more meanings or referents. In syllogistic reasoning, equivocation introduces a fourth term into the process. No conclusion can be validly drawn from premises that have four terms. Equivocation could also invalidate inductive reasoning. If the referent of the term used to specify the particulars keeps shifting, no valid generalization can be made about the series of particulars. (See SYLLLOGISM, pp. 54-5.)

    2. **Undistributed Middle Term**: This common fallacy results basically from a failure to supply a link in the chain of arguments, a failure to establish that the major term and the minor term coincide. A diagram of one form of this fallacy will point up the missing link.

    ```

    This arrangement of circles could be a schematic representation of an argument like the following:

    All Communists are people.
    All Americans are people.
    Therefore, all Americans are Communists.

    The B and C circles are shown to be comprehended within the larger A-circle, but the C-circle does not fall inside the B-circle, nor does it even overlap the B-circle. In other words, the two premises have not established that there is any connection between B and C. That failure to establish a connection is the missing link in this kind of argument, and until the link is supplied, we cannot arrive at any conclusion. (See SyLogism, p. 56.)

    3. Illicit Process: This is the fallacy in which a term in the conclusion has a wider extension than it has in the premises; or, to put it another way, a term is distributed or universal in the conclusion, but was undistributed or particular in the premise. It stands to reason that we cannot draw any conclusion about all men if in the premises we have been talking only about some men. Such a conclusion simply "does not follow." (See SyLogism, p. 56.)

    4. Conclusion from Two Negative Premises: Because two negative premises establish no relationship among all three terms in a syllogistic chain of reasoning, no conclusion, either affirmative or negative, can be drawn. Negative premises exclude relationships. Unless one of the premises is affirmative so that it can include a relationship, we cannot validly arrive at any conclusion. (See SYLLogism, p. 54.)

    5. Affirmative Conclusion from a Negative Premise: Since a negative premise excludes a relationship between two of the terms in a syllogism, the only kind of conclusion that can be arrived at logically is a proposition that excludes any relationship between one of these terms and a third term.

    It should be apparent from the diagram that it is logically impossible to get the terms free men and atheists together in any kind of affirmative predication. There may be an affirmative relationship between free men and atheists (for instance, the area of the atheist circle that is outside the Russian circle could fall inside the free men circle). But that relationship has to be demonstrated; it cannot be inferred from this set of premises. From this set of premises, we can logically deduce only this conclusion: Some atheists are not free men. (Since the X-area is inside the Russian circle and since no part of the Russian circle is in the free men circle, it stands to reason that the X-area cannot be in the free men circle.) The moral of this explication: do not allow anyone, including yourself, to draw an affirmative conclusion from a negative proposition. (See SYLLABIS, p. 54.)

    6. "Either/Or" Fallacy: This is a common fallacy of those who tend to
    judge life by a two-valued rather than a multi-valued system. Psychologists
    designate this tendency as the "black-or-white syndrome." There are some
    either/or situations from which we may draw valid inferences; the condition
    for valid inference is that the alternatives be exhaustive. If we start from the
    premise, "Either he voted for the candidate or he didn't vote for him," we
    can legitimately infer one alternative from the proof or disproof of the other
    alternative. We can make this inference validly because one or the other of
    the situations must exist. As the premise is phrased, no other situation is
    possible. But if we start from the premise, "Either he voted for the candidate
    or he voted for the candidate's opponent," we have not posed alternatives
    which take all the possible actions in the case into account. Voting for this
    or that candidate is not the only possibility; the man might not have voted at
    all or might have voted for a third candidate. So if we prove that he didn't
    vote for the candidate, we may not infer that he must have voted for the
    candidate's opponent; we have to go on to prove that he voted for the candi-
    date's opponent. (See Disyunctive SyLLocisMm, p. 59.)

    7. Fallacy of Affirming the Consequent: This is the fallacy occurring in de-
    ductive reasoning that starts out with a hypothetical proposition. For ex-

    If he makes concessions to the Russian ambassador, the prestige of
    the United States will decline.
    76 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    The consequent is affirmed: "The prestige of the United States has declined."
    The fallacy now is the conclusion drawn from this affirmation of the conse-
    quent: "He must have made concessions to the Russian ambassador." That
    conclusion is clearly a non sequitur. (See Hyporueticat SyLLocisMm, pp. 58-9.)

    8. Fallacy of Denying the Antecedent: This is another fallacy that can occur
    in reasoning from hypothetical propositions. For example:

    If he captures the undecided votes, he will win the election.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Logical Fallacies: Either/Or vs. Affirming the Consequent**\n\nConsider the following two scenarios and identify which fallacy is committed in each: \n\n**Scenario 1**: A student argues, ''Either I study for the exam or I don''t. Since I didn''t study, I must have failed the exam.''\n- **Task A**: Determine which fallacy this argument commits. Justify your answer by comparing it to the definition of the ''Either/Or'' fallacy in the text.\n- **Task B**: Explain why this conclusion is logically invalid, using the concept of exhaustive alternatives from the text.\n\n**Scenario 2**: A news headline states, ''If the economy improves, unemployment will drop. Unemployment has dropped. Therefore, the economy must have improved.''\n- **Task C**: Identify which fallacy this argument commits. Justify your answer by comparing it to the definition of the ''Affirming the Consequent'' fallacy in the text.\n- **Task D**: Explain why this conclusion is logically invalid, using the concept of hypothetical propositions and their logical structure.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the definitions provided in the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of the logical structure of each fallacy.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Reasoning with Logical Fallacies**\n\nConstruct a scenario where both the ''Either/Or'' fallacy and the ''Affirming the Consequent'' fallacy are committed in a single argument.\n- **Task A**: Describe the scenario in detail, ensuring that both fallacies are clearly illustrated.\n- **Task B**: Analyze each part of the argument to show how it commits the respective fallacy.\n- **Task C**: Explain why the combination of these two fallacies results in a stronger logical flaw than either one individually.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your scenario must be logically consistent and demonstrate an understanding of how different fallacies can interact in reasoning. The analysis must explicitly connect to the definitions and examples provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Hypothetical Propositions**\n\nConsider the hypothetical proposition: ''If a person is honest, then they will tell the truth.''\n- **Part A**: Construct an example that demonstrates the fallacy of ''Denying the Antecedent'' using this proposition.\n- **Part B**: Explain why denying the antecedent leads to an invalid conclusion, using the logical structure of hypothetical propositions as described in the text.\n- **Part C**: Contrast this fallacy with ''Affirming the Consequent'' by providing a separate example for each.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your examples must clearly illustrate the fallacies as defined in the text. The explanations must connect to the logical structure of hypothetical propositions and their implications for reasoning.'

- prompt: "The antecedent is denied: \"He did not capture the undecided votes.\" The  \nfallacy now is the conclusion drawn from this denial: \"He did not win the  \nelection.\" This conclusion would follow if it had been established that the  \nonly way to win the election is to capture the undecided votes. We would  \nhave to start out with, and secure agreement on, this premise: \"Only if he  \ncaptures the undecided votes, will he win the election.\" (See Hypothetical  \nSyllogism, pp. 58-9.)\n\nB. Fallacies of Reasoning in Induction\n\n1. Faulty Generalization: We are liable to this fallacy when we \"jump to  \na conclusion\" from inadequate evidence. Evidence can be inadequate in a  \nnumber of ways: (1) the particulars may be irrelevant; (2) the particulars  \nmay be unrepresentative; (3) the particulars may not be numerous enough  \nto warrant the conclusion. All of these inadequacies concern evidence  \ngathered by observation or study. Sometimes our generalizations are based  \non evidence derived from authority. Generalizations based on evidence de-  \nrived from authority can be faulty when the authority quoted is (1) biased  \nor prejudiced, (2) incompetent, (3) outmoded. Even when the authority  \nquoted is objective, competent, and reliable, a generalization from the evi-  \ndence supplied by this authority can be faulty if the authority is (1) inac-  \ncurately quoted, (2) misinterpreted, (3) quoted out of context.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Logical Fallacy Analysis: Denial of Antecedent**\n\nThe text discusses the fallacy of denying the antecedent: ''He did not capture the undecided votes.'' The conclusion drawn is ''He did not win the election.''\n- **Task**: Explain why this conclusion is logically invalid, using the premise that ''Only if he captures the undecided votes, will he win the election.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the structure of the original argument (antecedent and consequent).\n- **Step 2**: Use a logical form to represent the argument (e.g., ''If P, then Q'' vs. ''Not P, therefore not Q'').\n- **Step 3**: Reference the hypothetical syllogism from the text to demonstrate why the conclusion fails.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly identify the logical flaw and reference the text''s discussion of hypothetical syllogism (pp. 58-9).'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Faulty Generalization in Inductive Reasoning**\n\nThe text describes faulty generalizations based on inadequate evidence, including those derived from authority.\n- **Task**: Construct an example of a faulty generalization using the following structure:\n1. A reliable authority claims that ''All X are Y''\n2. Based on this claim, a person concludes that ''Z is Y''\n3. Identify the fallacy in this reasoning and explain why it''s invalid using the text''s criteria for faulty generalizations (e.g., unrepresentative evidence, misinterpretation).\n- **Part A**: Provide a concrete example of such reasoning.\n- **Part B**: Use the text''s criteria to justify why this example is a faulty generalization.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the text''s discussion of authority-based generalizations and their potential fallacies (pp. 125-6).'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Thinking on Inductive Fallacies**\n\nThe text discusses multiple fallacies in reasoning, including faulty generalization and the denial of antecedent.\n- **Task**: Compare and contrast two fallacies discussed in the text: the denial of antecedent and faulty generalization.\n- **Part A**: Explain how each fallacy differs in terms of logical structure and reasoning.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example for each fallacy that demonstrates its distinct characteristics.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of these fallacies in real-world scenarios (e.g., political campaigns, scientific research).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s definitions of both fallacies and demonstrate an understanding of their distinct logical errors.'

    2. Faulty Casual Generalizations: These are fallacies to which all cause-and-effect inferences are liable. These fallacies can occur when we argue (1) from an effect to a cause or (2) from a cause to an effect. We offend in the first way (1) when we assign an inadequate cause to an effect; (2) when we fail to take into account the fact that there could be more than one cause for the same effect. We offend in the second way (1) when we fail to establish that a potential cause of an effect could and did operate in a particular situation; (2) when we fail to take into account that the same cause can produce diverse effects. One of the commonest instances of faulty causal generalization is the fallacy commonly referred to as post hoc, ergo propter hoc ("after this, therefore because of this"). This fallacy results from the assumption that because there is a temporal relationship between events (something happened after something else) there is also a causal relationship—e.g. "Our sales shot up 25 per cent after we started using that musical jingle in our advertising campaign." The use of the musical jingle may have been a cause for the increase in sales. But we may not assume that it was a cause; we must prove that it was a cause. (See Common Topics, pp. 112-13.)

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Post Hoc Fallacy in Real-World Scenarios**\n\nEvaluate the following argument and identify any faulty causal generalization present:\n\n"The company introduced a new product line last month, and since then, customer complaints have increased by 40%. Therefore, the new product line must be the cause of the increased complaints."\n\n- **Step 1**: Determine if this argument commits the post hoc fallacy. Justify your answer by referencing the definition of post hoc provided in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Propose at least two alternative explanations for the increase in complaints that are not related to the new product line. Use logical reasoning based on the text''s discussion of multiple potential causes for a single effect.\n- **Step 3**: Explain why the argument fails to establish causation, according to the text''s criteria for proving a causal relationship.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s definition of post hoc and demonstrate an understanding of how multiple causes can lead to a single effect.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Identifying Faulty Causal Reasoning in Historical Events**\n\nConsider the following historical argument:\n\n"The Industrial Revolution began in Britain because of its access to coal. Therefore, without coal resources, the Industrial Revolution could not have occurred anywhere else in the world."\n\n- **Step 1**: Identify and explain two specific fallacies present in this argument based on the text''s discussion of faulty causal generalization.\n- **Step 2**: Provide at least two pieces of evidence from the text that support the idea that a single cause (like coal) can lead to different effects in different contexts.\n- **Step 3**: Reconstruct the argument to eliminate the fallacies, ensuring that it aligns with the text''s criteria for establishing causation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate mastery of the text''s concepts by clearly identifying and correcting the faulty reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Constructing a Counterexample to Faulty Causal Generalization**\n\nCreate an example that illustrates the fallacy of assuming a causal relationship based on temporal succession, without establishing causation.\n\n- **Part A**: Describe a real-world scenario where two events occur in sequence, but the first event is not the cause of the second.\n- **Part B**: Explain how this scenario demonstrates the post hoc fallacy as defined in the text.\n- **Part C**: Propose at least two alternative explanations for the relationship between the events that are not based on causation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your example must be original and directly relate to the text''s discussion of faulty causal reasoning, with clear logical reasoning in each part.'

    : Faulty Analogy: Argument by analogy is always the most vulnerable of
    ill modes of argument. It is always exposed to the charge, "The analogy
    does not hold." But some analogies are more vulnerable than others. They
    are especially vulnerable when they concentrate on irrelevant, inconsequential
    similarities between two situations and overlook pertinent, significant dis-
    similarities. The analogical argument, "Where there is smoke, there is fire,"
    commonly used to throw suspicion on someone's character or activity, is
    frequently open to the objection that the persuasiveness of the similarities
    is weakened, if not entirely nullified, by the dissimilarities. While it is true
    that argument by analogy always rests on shaky ground, it is possible for
    someone to become so niggling in his attitude toward all analogy that he is
    liable to strain at a gnat and swallow a camel. Perhaps we can avoid this
    carping habit by remembering that an analogy never proves anything; at
    best, it persuades someone on the grounds of probability. It is the degree
    of probability that will be susceptible to challenge.

    ( Miscellaneous Fallacies

    A number of fallacies will be grouped here under the heading "Miscel-
    laneous" because they are not peculiar to either inductive or deductive reason-
    ing and because they are a blend of material fallacies, formal fallacies, and
    emotional fallacies.

    1. Begging the Question: This fallacy (labelled petitio principi by the
    Scholastic logicians) is found more often in deductive reasoning than in
    inductive reasoning. Basically, this is the fault of circular reasoning. In syl-
    logistic reasoning, for instance, this fallacy occurs when we assume in the
    premise the conclusion that we are trying to prove. A lawyer would be
    guilty of "begging the question" if he pleaded before a jury, "My client
    would not steal because he is an honest man." We can more readily detect
    the petitio principi if we reconstruct the full chain of reasoning from the
    lawyer's enthymeme:

    Any man who is honest will not steal.
    My client is honest.
    Therefore, my client would not steal.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Evaluating the Strength of an Analogical Argument**\n\nThe text states that ''argument by analogy always rests on shaky ground'' but also acknowledges that analogies can be persuasive. Analyze the analogy ''Where there is smoke, there is fire'' in two ways:\n- **Part A**: Identify at least three relevant similarities between the analogy and a real-world scenario where an analogy might be used to persuade.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the analogy is vulnerable to criticism, citing specific disimilarities that could weaken its persuasiveness.\n- **Part C**: Propose a revised version of the analogy that addresses these weaknesses, ensuring it remains logically sound and persuasive.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s critique of analogies and show how to construct a more effective analogy based on logical reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Identifying and Correcting a Fallacy in Syllogistic Reasoning**\n\nThe text provides an example of ''begging the question'' in syllogistic reasoning. Reconstruct the lawyer''s argument as a full syllogism and identify the fallacy:\n- **Part A**: Translate the lawyer''s enthymeme into a standard syllogistic form (Major premise, Minor premise, Conclusion).\n- **Part B**: Explain why this reasoning falls into the ''begging the question'' fallacy, referencing the text''s definition of circular reasoning.\n- **Part C**: Propose an alternative syllogism that avoids this fallacy, ensuring the conclusion is logically supported by the premises.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of syllogistic reasoning and the specific fallacy described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesizing Logical Fallacies and Argument Structures**\n\nThe text categorizes fallacies as ''miscellaneous'' because they blend material, formal, and emotional elements. Analyze the following scenarios and identify the fallacy type:\n- **Part A**: A politician claims, ''Our opponent is a liar because they are dishonest.'' Identify the fallacy and explain how it combines material and emotional reasoning.\n- **Part B**: A student argues, ''This book is boring because I don''t like it.'' Identify the fallacy and explain how it reflects a formal logical error.\n- **Part C**: Construct an example of a fallacy that combines all three types (material, formal, emotional) and explain why it is logically flawed.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must show a comprehensive understanding of the text''s classification of fallacies and their interplay in real-world arguments.'

    The second premise and the conclusion say the same thing in different words, because of the tautological definition set up in the first premise. The argument eddies around in a circle; it doesn't go anywhere. We get this same kind of circular argument in a sequence like this: "God exists." "How do you know that God exists?" "The Bible says so." "Why should I put my credence in what the Bible says?" "Because it's the inspired word of God." God is worthy of a more cogent argument than this.

    One of the commonest and subtlest forms of this fallacy is the question-begging epithet: "This murderer should be put away for life." "We don't want any controversial figures as lecturers in this state." "This creeping socialism won't fool the American people." The occurrence of certain formulas should alert us that an instance of question-begging may be lurking in the verbiage. We should be on our guard whenever we meet expressions like "obviously," "of course," "as everyone knows," "really," "unquestionably." (Whenever you see one of these expressions in this textbook, take another look at the sentence in which these expressions occur to see whether what the author has said is obvious or unquestionable.)

    2. Argument Ad Hominem ("to the man"): This is a form of emotional argument, the fallacy of switching the argument from a discussion of issues to a discussion of personalities. If we find that we cannot refute a man's argument, we might attack his character. "My opponent's arguments are very impressive, but remember, this is the man who deserted his faithful wife and family after he had won his first political victory." Judged by its prevalence throughout history, this tendency to denigrate the character of one who espouses a cause or argument rather than to evaluate the cause or argument on its own merits seems to be natural to man. We sometimes see this sort of thing in literary criticism. Attention is diverted from the literary work itself to a discussion of the vicious character of the author; the work is assumed to be foul because the author is a notorious rake. As Alexander Pope said,

    A man's character can have some relevance to an argument—when, for
    instance, we are attempting to assess the reliability of his testimony or the
    likelihood of his having done something—but a discussion of a man's
    character becomes an irrelevancy—and thereby a form of fallacy—when such
    a discussion is used merely to distract attention from the issue at hand. Be-
    ware of the "poisoned spring" tactic.

    THE APPEAL TO REASON 79

    3. Argument Ad Populum ("to the people'): This is another devious emo-
    tional appeal, similar to the argument ad hominem. This is the tactic of
    appealing to irrational fears and prejudices in order to prevent audiences
    from squarely facing the issues. Honorific terms—Americanism, patriotism,
    motherhood, rugged individualism—are used to stir up a favorable emotional
    climate; pejorative terms—socialism, godlessness, radical, reactionary—are
    used to arouse hostile reactions. None of these terms are "good" or "bad" in
    themselves. They become "weasel words" when they so color the emotional
    atmosphere of a discussion that men are disposed to accept as proven what
    has only been asserted. Appeals to emotions are legitimate—in fact, rhetoricians
    maintained that men often could not be moved to action unless their emotions
    were touched—but appeals to emotions are reprehensible when they cloud the
    issue, when they anesthetize men's rational faculties, when they move men to do
    things or accept things which they would not do or accept if their conscience or
    reason were allowed to operate.

    4. The "Red Herring": This is another diversionary tactic. "Red herring" is a term adopted from hunting and refers to the practice of dragging a herring across the trace in order to lead the hounds astray from their pursuit of the prey. The classical term for this fallacy is ignoratio elenchi (literally, "ignorance of the refutation"). This is another device, like the ad hominem or ad populum arguments, of ignoring or avoiding the issue. Backed into a corner in an argument, all of us are prone to steer the discussion to a side issue. "You accuse me of cheating on my income tax, but doesn't everybody cheat a little bit?" "So what if the general did lose that battle? Think of all his glorious victories in the past." The disputant who allows his opponent to "change the subject," to dodge the main issue, may soon find himself losing the argument because his opponent has shifted his position to safer ground.

    5. The Complex Question: An oft-quoted example of this is the question, "When did you stop beating your wife?" It is impossible to give a simple answer to such a question without incriminating oneself. What is wrong here is that a question like this has two parts. It combines these questions: "Do you beat your wife?" and "When did you stop beating her?" It is a form of question-begging. Just as a defending lawyer would jump to his feet to protest the prosecutor's question, "Why did you steal the diamond ring?" so anyone confronted with a two-pronged question should insist that the implicit question be dealt with first. "Wait a minute. Let's determine first whether I ever beat my wife." A familiar legislative practice is to attach riders to an important bill. When the bill is brought up for a vote, the legislator is faced with a dilemma. He may favor the main bill but object to the riders, or vice versa. But he is now placed in a situation where he has to accept or reject the whole package. In an argument, fortunately, we can insist that a complex question be dealt with part by part.

    In the previous section we dealt at some length with the logical appeals, the materials and methods of proof or persuasion that appeal to the reason. Ideally, men should be able to conduct a discussion or argument exclusively on the level of reason. But the rhetoricians were realistic enough to recognize that men are creatures of passion and of will as well as of intellect. We have to deal with men as they are, not as they should be. If we conceive of rhetoric as the art of discovering all the available means of persuasion, we will be disposed to make use of whatever effective (and, one would hope, legitimate) means lie open to us. As was pointed out earlier, Aristotle recognized a second means in the ethical appeal, the persuasive value of the speaker's or writer's character.

    The ethical appeal can be the most effective kind of appeal; even the cleverest and soundest appeal to the reason could fall on deaf ears if the audience reacted unfavorably to the speaker's character. The ethical appeal is especially important in rhetorical discourse, because here we deal with matters about which absolute certainty is impossible and opinions are divided. Quintilian felt that of the three kinds of rhetorical discourse, deliberative oratory had the most need for the ethical appeal (he called it auctoritas). As Quintilian said, "For he who would have all men trust his judgment as to what is expedient and honourable, should possess and be regarded as possessing genuine wisdom and excellence of character."—Institutio Oratoria, III, vii, 13.

    The ethical appeal is exerted, according to Aristotle, when the speech itself impresses the audience that the speaker is a man of sound sense (phronésis), high moral character (areté), and benevolence (eunoia). Notice that it is the speech itself which must create this impression. Thus a man wholly unknown to his audience (and this is often the case when we listen to a speech or read an article in a magazine) could by his words alone inspire this kind of confidence. Some men, of course, already have a reputation familiar to an audience, and this reputation, if it is a good one, will favorably dispose an audience toward a man, even before he utters a word. In the last analysis, however, it is the discourse itself which must establish or maintain the ethical appeal, for what a man says in any particular discourse could weaken or destroy his previously established reputation.

    How does a man create the impression by his discourse that he is a man of sound sense, high moral character, and benevolence? The question is crucial; unfortunately, the answer must be couched in rather general terms. An obvious answer, of the general sort, is that a man must truly possess these qualities. "No one gives what he does not have," as the Latin maxim puts it. It is not the province of rhetoric, however, to form such a character—except perhaps in an indirect way. While it is true that the whole man is engaged in any communicative discourse, rhetoric can train only those difficulties involved in the discovery, arrangement, and expression of ideas.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Ethical Appeal through Rhetorical Discourse**\n\nHow can a speaker establish the ethical appeal of sound sense (phronésis), high moral character (areté), and benevolence (eunoia) through their discourse, according to the text?\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key elements of ethical appeal as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how these elements can be conveyed through rhetorical strategies, even if the speaker''s actual character is not known to the audience.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example of how a speaker might use logical reasoning or stylistic choices to create the impression of these qualities.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s assertion that "the speech itself must create this impression" and demonstrate an understanding of how rhetoric can indirectly shape the audience''s perception of a speaker''s character.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**The Role of Rhetoric in Character Formation**\n\nAccording to the text, can rhetoric directly shape a speaker''s character, or is it limited to influencing the audience''s perception of that character?\n- **Step 1**: Define the role of rhetoric in shaping character, as outlined in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Compare and contrast the speaker''s actual character with the audience''s perception of that character.\n- **Step 3**: Argue whether rhetoric can indirectly influence the audience''s belief in a speaker''s moral character, using examples from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly state that rhetoric "can train only those difficulties involved in the discovery, arrangement, and expression of ideas" and that it does not directly form character but can indirectly influence audience perception.

    If we grant that a man strongly imbued with good sense, good moral fiber,
    and good will toward others will be disposed to conduct a discourse in a
    manner that will exert a strong ethical appeal, can we lay down any other
    positive precepts? Positive precepts, yes, but no more specific than the one
    just proposed. If a discourse is to exhibit a man's good sense, it must show
    that the speaker or writer has an adequate, if not a professionally erudite,
    versa of the subject he is talking about, that he knows and observes the
    principles of valid reasoning, that he is capable of viewing a situation in the
    proper perspective, that he has read widely, and that he has good taste and
    discriminating judgment. If a discourse is to reflect a man's moral character,
    it must display a man's abhorrence of unscrupulous tactics and specious
    reasoning, his respect for the commonly acknowledged virtues, and his
    immutable integrity. If the discourse is to manifest a man's good will, it must
    display a man's sincere interest in the welfare of his audience and his readi-
    ness to sacrifice any self-aggrandizement that conflicts with the benefit of
    others.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Ethical Discourse Principles**\n\nUsing the text''s definition of a ''discourse that exhibits good sense,'' construct an argument in favor of a policy proposal. Your argument must:\n- Demonstrate that the speaker has ''an adequate, if not a professionally erudite, versa of the subject''\n- Show that the speaker ''knows and observes the principles of valid reasoning''\n- Illustrate that the speaker can ''view a situation in the proper perspective''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must be a written argument of at least 150 words, structured with clear statements that directly reference the text''s ethical precepts. You must also identify at least three distinct elements from the text that are integral to your argument''s validity.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Application of Moral Character in Discourse**\n\nEvaluate the claim: ''A discourse can reflect a man''s moral character without displaying an abhorrence of unscrupulous tactics.''\n- **Part A**: Argue whether this claim is valid based on the text''s description of moral character in discourse.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of a discourse that might be interpreted as lacking this abhorrence, and explain why it would not fully reflect the speaker''s moral character according to the text.\n- **Part C**: Justify why ''immutable integrity'' is a more essential component of moral character than ''respect for commonly acknowledged virtues,'' using the text''s definitions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s definitions and provide a coherent argument that integrates all three components of moral character described in the passage.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Expressing Good Will**\n\nDesign a public speech that demonstrates ''a man''s sincere interest in the welfare of his audience'' and ''readiness to sacrifice any self-aggrandizement that conflicts with the benefit of others.''\n- **Part A**: Outline the structure of your speech, including an introduction that establishes good will, a body that addresses audience welfare, and a conclusion that emphasizes self-sacrifice.\n- **Part B**: Include at least two specific examples of how the speaker would prioritize audience benefit over personal gain.\n- **Part C**: Explain how your speech reflects the text''s assertion that ''good will'' is ''a man''s sincere interest in the welfare of his audience.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must be a detailed speech outline with clear examples, and it must explicitly connect each element of the speech to the text''s definition of good will.'

    It will help too if the discourse displays a man's sound knowledge of
    human psychology and his nice sense of appropriate style. He must be aware
    of the kind of éthos that Aristotle talked about in Book II, Chapters 12-17
    of the Rhetoric—the nature of various forms of government and the charac-
    ter of different periods of life (youth, middle age, old age) and of different
    conditions of life (wealth, poverty, education, illiteracy, health, sickness).
    Aware of the disposition of people at various ages and in various conditions
    of life, the speaker or writer will adapt his tone and his sentiments to fit
    his audience. Old men, for instance, do not think and act and view things
    in the same way that adolescents do. Young men are, by and large, quick-
    tempered, fickle, impetuous, idealistic; old men tend to be phlegmatic, con-
    servative, deliberate, and pragmatic. Women react to certain things differ-
    ently from men. Rich men and poor men view things in different ways. Men
    accustomed to a democratic way of life respond to certain sentiments and
    'arguments in a different way from men brought up in a dictatorship.

    82 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    The whole discourse must maintain the "image" that the speaker or writer
    seeks to establish. The ethical appeal, in other words, must be pervasive
    throughout the discourse. The effect of the ethical appeal might very well
    be destroyed by a single lapse from good sense, good will, or moral integrity.
    A note of peevishness, a touch of malevolence, a flash of bad taste, a sudden
    display of inaccuracy or illogic could jeopardize a man's whole persuasive
    effort.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Ethical Appeal in Rhetoric**\n\nA speaker is addressing a group of elderly individuals who are well-educated and financially stable. Using the principles from the text on ethical appeal, explain how the speaker should adjust their tone and content to effectively persuade this audience.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the characteristics of the target audience based on the text (e.g., age, education, economic status).\n- **Step 2**: Apply the concept of ''éthos'' as described in Aristotle''s Rhetoric (Book II, Chapters 12-17) to determine the speaker''s ethical stance.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how the speaker''s tone, arguments, and ethical positioning should align with the audience''s values and dispositions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the ethical appeal''s role in persuasion and how it is adapted to different audience characteristics.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Ethical Appeal in Persuasive Writing**\n\nWrite a short paragraph that exemplifies the ethical appeal (ethos) in a modern context. Your example must include:\n- A speaker who is well-respected in their field (e.g., a doctor, scientist, or academic)\n- A topic that requires ethical credibility (e.g., health, technology, environmental issues)\n- A statement or argument that reflects the speaker''s moral integrity and good will\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must show a clear application of the ethical appeal in persuasion, with explicit references to the text''s discussion on ethos and audience adaptation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Rhetorical Dispositions**\n\nCompare and contrast the ethical dispositions of a democratic versus a dictatorial upbringing, as outlined in the text. How might these differences influence a speaker''s approach to persuasion?\n- **Part A**: Explain the characteristics of individuals raised in democratic societies (e.g., openness, critical thinking).\n- **Part B**: Describe the traits of individuals raised in dictatorial environments (e.g., obedience, conformity).\n- **Part C**: Analyze how these differing dispositions affect the effectiveness of ethical appeals in different contexts.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion on ethical appeal and audience adaptation, demonstrating a logical understanding of how upbringing influences persuasive strategies.'

    But although the ethical appeal must be maintained by the discourse as a whole, there may be places in the discourse where the author will make a special overt attempt to establish his credit with his audience or to ingratiate himself with his audience. The two places in the discourse where authors commonly make such explicit overtures are the introduction and the con- clusion. The author does not explicitly call attention to the fact that he is seeking to impress or conciliate his audience, but his effort to impress his audience is nonetheless obvious and calculated. The following quotation, from the opening paragraph of one of Benjamin Franklin's speeches, exemplifies just such an overt attempt:

    It is with reluctance that I rise to express a disapprobation of any one article of the plan, for which we are so much obliged to the honorable gentleman who laid it before us. From its first reading, I have borne a good will to it, and, in general, wished it success. In this particular of salaries to the executive branch, I happen to differ; and, as my opinion may appear new and chimerical, it is only from a persuasion that it is right, and from a sense of duty, that I hazard it. The Committee will judge of my reasons when they have heard them, and their judgment may possibly change mine. I think I see inconvenience in the appointment of salaries; I see none in refusing them, but on the contrary great advantages.

    From Benjamin Franklin, Speech in the Constitutional Convention on the Subject of Salaries, June 2, 1787.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Rhetorical Device in Speech Introductions**\n\nExamine the opening paragraph of Benjamin Franklin''s speech and identify two rhetorical devices used to establish credibility with the audience.\n- **Step 1**: Determine which two rhetorical devices are employed in the first sentence: "It is with reluctance that I rise to express a disapprobation of any one article of the plan..."\n- **Step 2**: Explain how these devices contribute to Franklin''s attempt to ingratiate himself with his audience.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this approach to the general principle that "introductions should establish credibility" as discussed in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference specific language from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how rhetorical devices serve the purpose of credibility in speeches.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluation of Logical Reasoning in Argument Construction**\n\nAnalyze Franklin''s argument regarding salaries to the executive branch.\n- **Part A**: Identify two logical fallacies or weaknesses in his reasoning that could undermine his credibility.\n- **Part B**: Propose a counterargument that addresses these weaknesses while maintaining Franklin''s original position.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the structure of his speech (introduction, argument, conclusion) supports or detracts from his overall credibility.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the principles of classical rhetoric discussed in the text and demonstrate an ability to critically assess argumentation strategies.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Ethical Appeal and Rhetorical Strategies**\n\nCompose a short speech (3-4 sentences) that uses both ethical appeal (ethos) and an overt attempt to ingratiate with the audience, similar to Franklin''s approach.\n- **Step 1**: Begin with a statement that acknowledges the audience''s trust and expresses willingness to engage constructively.\n- **Step 2**: Introduce a controversial point while maintaining a tone of respect and humility.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a call to action that reinforces your credibility and the value of collaboration.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your speech must explicitly incorporate the rhetorical strategies discussed in the text and demonstrate an understanding of how ethical appeal and audience ingratiation work together to persuade.'

    Franklin is about to argue against a proposal made to the Constitutional Convention, but he must dispose his audience to listen to his counterarguments. So he tries to show that he harbors no ill will toward the man who made the proposal ("for which we are so much obliged to the honorable gentleman who laid it before us"; "I have borne good will to it"); that he is motivated in his objection, not by partisan considerations but by principle ("from a persuasion that it is right, and from a sense of duty"); that he is not so cocksure of his own views that he is impervious to correction ("their judgment may possibly change mine"). The overall impression created by this brief overture is that of a modest, magnanimous, open-minded gentleman. Even his opponents in the assembly would be disposed to listen to his counterarguments.

    THE ETHICAL APPEAL 82

    Here is an example of a special attempt to exert an ethical appeal in the closing paragraph of a discourse:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Ethical Appeal in Argumentation**\n\nFranklin''s speech to the Constitutional Convention includes an ethical appeal aimed at convincing his audience of his motives. Analyze how Franklin uses the following elements to build credibility:\n- **Part A**: The phrase "for which we are so much obliged to the honorable gentleman who laid it before us"\n- **Part B**: The statement "I have borne good will to it"\n- **Part C**: The admission "their judgment may possibly change mine"\n\n**Task**: Explain how these statements collectively create an impression of a moderate and principled individual. Use specific examples from the text to illustrate each component''s role in establishing ethical credibility.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts of goodwill, humility, and principle as outlined in the text.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Ethical Appeal Strategies**\n\nIn the closing paragraph of a discourse, an ethical appeal is used to persuade readers. Using the example from the text (Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.), explain how the following elements contribute to an ethical appeal:\n- **Part A**: The use of "we" instead of "I" in the statement "from a persuasion that it is right, and from a sense of duty"\n- **Part B**: The acknowledgment of potential change in opinion ("their judgment may possibly change mine")\n- **Part C**: The reference to being "so much obliged to the honorable gentleman"\n\n**Task**: Compare and contrast these elements with Franklin''s approach in the text. How does each contribute to the ethical appeal?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how language choices and acknowledgment of others'' perspectives enhance the ethical appeal.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning in Ethical Argumentation**\n\nThe text describes how Franklin''s speech uses ethical appeals to persuade his audience. Construct a logical argument using the principles from the text to refute the claim that ethical appeals are only effective in formal, written discourse.\n- **Part A**: Identify two key elements from Franklin''s speech that demonstrate the effectiveness of ethical appeals in spoken discourse.\n- **Part B**: Use these elements to create a logical argument that ethical appeals are also effective in oral communication.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the use of "we" and acknowledgment of others'' perspectives in Franklin''s speech supports this argument.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concepts of credibility, humility, and shared responsibility as presented in the text.'

    In this work, when it shall be found that much is omitted, let it not be
    forgotten that much likewise is performed; and though no book was ever
    spared out of tenderness to the author, and the world is little solicitous to
    know whence proceeded the faults of that which it condemns; yet it may
    gratify curiosity to inform it, that the English Dictionary was written
    with little assistance of the learned, and without any patronage of the
    great; not in the soft obscurities of retirement, or under the shelter of
    academic bowers, but amid inconvenience and distraction, in sickness and
    in sorrow. It may repress the triumph of malignant criticism to observe
    that if our language is not here fully displayed, I have only failed in an
    attempt which no human powers have hitherto completed. If the lexicons
    of ancient tongues, now immutably fixed, and comprised in a few vol-
    umes, be yet, after the toil of successive ages, inadequate and delusive; if
    the aggregated knowledge and cooperating diligence of the Italian acade-
    micians did not secure them from the censure of Beni; if the embodied
    critics of France, when fifty years had been spent upon their work, were
    obliged to change its economy and give their second edition another form,
    I may surely be contented without the praise of perfection, which, if I
    could obtain, in this gloom of solitude, what would it avail me? I have
    protracted my work till most of those whom I wished to please have sunk
    into the grave, and success and miscarriage are empty sounds: I therefore
    dismiss it with frigid tranquillity, having little to fear from censure or
    from praise.

Identify three rhetorical strategies used by Samuel Johnson in this preface, and explain how each contributes to his overall purpose.\n- **Strategy 1**: Address the potential criticism of his work''s incompleteness by acknowledging its shortcomings.\n- **Strategy 2**: Use self-deprecating humor to defend the work against harsh criticism.\n- **Strategy 3**: Employ a reflective tone to convey his personal struggle and dedication despite the work''s limitations.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate specific examples from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how each rhetorical device serves Johnson''s purpose.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Authorial Intent**\n\nJohnson''s preface reflects on the challenges and motivations behind his work. How does the text reveal his attitude toward the possibility of achieving perfection in a work of this nature?\n- **Part A**: Examine the rhetorical question: ''If the lexicons of ancient tongues... be yet, after the toil of successive ages, inadequate and delusive?''\n- **Part B**: Analyze the statement: ''I have only failed in an attempt which no human powers have hitherto completed.''\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the author''s conclusion: ''I therefore dismiss it with frigid tranquillity, having little to fear from censure or from praise.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must show a clear understanding of Johnson''s philosophical stance on the limits of human achievement and his acceptance of imperfection in intellectual endeavors.'

    Here a good deal of the ethical appeal is being exerted by the style, for this
    is certainly a magnificent piece of English prose. But Dr. Johnson is also
    making a deliberate effort to say those things about himself and his work
    that will leave his audience with a favorable opinion of him. Throughout
    the long discourse that preceded this final paragraph, Johnson had been
    explaining what he hoped to do in his Dictionary, what difficulties he faced
    in effecting his purpose, and what his successes and failures were. That
    elaborate exposition itself helped to create the impression of an intelligent,
    self-sacrificing, high-minded scholar. Here now in this final paragraph he
    makes an overt effort to reinforce the impression of himself. What comes
    through to the audience is a suitable blend of modesty and confidence, of
    regrets and self-gratulations, of animus and forgiveness.

    It would be easy to find illustrations, in contemporary speeches, articles,
    and letters, of discourse that failed to create favorable impressions of the men
    who composed them. But since there is something uncharitable about publicly
    exposing someone, whether living or dead, as an example of an unprincipled,
    stupid, malevolent, or generally unprepossessing person, let us take as our
    example some fictitious person. Here is an excerpt from Pride and Prejudice
    in which Mr. Collins proposes marriage to Elizabeth Bennet:

    "My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier—that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honor of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favor of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.

    This speech provides a classic example of a man who intends to convey a favorable impression of himself but succeeds only in discrediting himself by what he says and the manner in which he says it. There are two audiences for Mr. Collins's speech: Elizabeth and the reader. Jane Austen clearly intends to reveal Mr. Collins for the pompous, self-righteous, egocentric timesterver that he is, but we cannot presume that Elizabeth will react in exactly the same way as we do to Mr. Collins's speech. We must make some allowances for the mores of the age and for the kind of person Elizabeth herself is. A young girl of that time would expect a man to propose to her in the highly formal language that Mr. Collins uses, and she would probably not have been as unfavorably impressed as we are by Mr. Collins's mercenary considerations.

    But even when all these allowances are made for the differences in the reactions of the two audiences for the speech, we cannot believe that after this exposure of Mr. Collins's motives Elizabeth could regard him as a man of "good sense, good will, and high moral character." She had developed an antipathy for him before this moment which this display of rhetoric could do nothing but confirm. Hence, we are not at all surprised at the firmness and forthrightness of her rejection of Mr. Collins: "I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make you so." And if we the readers needed any further confirmation of our unfavorable impression of him we could turn to that delightfully obnoxious letter of condolence that he sends to the Bennet family in Chapter 48 upon the occasion of Lydia's elopement.

    Where is no denying the role that the ethical appeal plays in the persuasive process. In a sense, the ethical appeal is the "hidden persuader." In our world, such enterprises as public relations, motivational psychology, market research, and advertising, are engaged in searching for effective stimuli and in creating the proper "image." The groundwork for all of this activity was laid by Aristotle two thousand years ago.

    Aristotle discussed the ethical appeal, not only because he recognized how vital it was in persuasion but also because he wanted to answer the enemies of rhetoric, like Socrates, who complained that rhetoricians sanctioned any kind of shallow knowledge, sophistical reasoning, and unscrupulous tactics that would gain the end of persuasion. If persuasion depends greatly, even pre-eminently, on ethical appeal, the persuader cannot afford to create the impression by his discourse that he is superficial, immoral, or malicious. Cicero and Quintilian, with their insistence on "the good man speaking," may have given greater emphasis to the importance of the ethical image than Aristotle did, but they were not supplying a note that Aristotle had entirely neglected.

    The Emotional Appeal

    The third mode of persuasion specified by Aristotle and recognized by all later rhetoricians is the appeal to the emotions of the audience. People are rather sheepish about acknowledging that their opinions can be affected by their emotions. They have the uneasy feeling that there is something undignified about being stirred to action through the emotions. And indeed, in some cases, there is something undignified about a rational man being precipitated into action through the stimulus of his aroused passions. All of us at one time or another have been ashamed of something we did under the pressure of strong emotion. The source of our shame was not so much that we had been prompted to action by our emotions as that we had done something regrettable. We are not ashamed of falling in love, even though the act of falling in love is prompted by strong emotion. But we are ashamed of hurling a vase against the wall in a fit of anger. What makes the difference here is the consequences of our emotional stress. Because falling in love was "good," we felt no compunction; because smashing the vase was "evil," we were ashamed of our impulsive act.

    There is nothing necessarily reprehensible about being moved to action through our emotions; in fact, it is perfectly normal. Since it is our will ultimately that moves us to action and since the emotions have a powerful influence on the will, many of our actions are prompted by the stimulus of our emotions. When it is not pure emotion that prompts our will, it is a combination of reason and emotion. This fact has a great bearing on the strategies of rhetoric.

    George Campbell, the eighteenth-century Scottish rhetorician, made a strong claim for the important part that emotions play in the persuasive process: "So far, therefore, is it from being an unfair method of persuasion to move the passions, that there is no persuasion without moving them."—Philosophy of Rhetoric, Book I, Ch. VII.

    Richard Whately, the nineteenth-century English rhetorician, analyzed the persuasive process this way: "For in order that the Will may be influenced, two things are requisite: (1) that the proposed Object should appear desirable; and (2) that the Means suggested should be proved to be conducive to the attainment of that object."—Elements of Rhetoric, Part II, Ch. I. It is argument (the appeal to the understanding) that produces conviction about the conduciveness of the means to the desired end; it is the appeal to the emotions that makes the end seem desirable. In order to whip up a people into a mood for war, one would have to do two things: (1) remind the people that the freedom and security of a nation is a desirable end; (2) convince them that going to war is the best means of securing this end. The order of these two activities can vary. Sometimes it will be better to excite the desire first and then show that there is some connection between the proposed action and the end; at other times, it will be more expedient to convince the understanding first and then stir up the emotions.

    Do not some men play on people's emotions for unscrupulous purposes?
    Of course they do. All of us could tick off a half dozen examples from his-
    tory without much strain on the memory. The fact that some men exploit
    the emotions for unscrupulous purposes may constitute a caution about the
    use of emotional appeal, but it does not constitute a condemnation of emo-
    tional appeal. Some men use sophistical arguments, but we do not therefore
    condemn all argument as a means of effecting conviction.

    An important consideration for rhetoric is that our emotions are not under
    the direct control of volition. We cannot will ourselves into being angry
    against someone. On the other hand, our intellectual faculties, reason and
    memory, are under the direct control of our will. We can, by an act of the
    will, force ourselves to recall historical facts, to engage in calculation, to
    analyze a whole, or to synthesize parts.

    There are two consequences for rhetoric from the fact that our will does
    not have direct control of our emotions. The first consequence is that it is
    perilous to announce to an audience that we are going to play on the emo-
    tions. As soon as we apprize an audience of such an intention, we jeopardize,
    if we do not entirely destroy, the effectiveness of the emotional appeal. It is
    not so with appeals to the understanding. It is frequently advantageous to
    announce to an audience that we are about to embark upon a course of
    reasoning. Accordingly, we have no hesitation about calling attention to the
    conclusion we hope to establish, to the steps we will take in proving our
    point, or to our method of arguing.

    The second consequence for rhetoric is that we must get at the emotions

    Indirectly. We cannot arouse an emotion, either in ourselves or in others, by
    thinking about it. We arouse emotion by contemplating the object that stirs
    the emotion. So if we seek to arouse the anger of an audience, we must de-
    scribe a person or a situation of a sort that will make the audience angry.
    The anger can be enkindled even when the description is quite dispassionate.
    Horace's precept that if you want me to feel an emotion, you must first feel
    that emotion yourself (si vis me flere, dolendum est primum ipsi tubt) is
    basically sound, but it is possible to feel an emotion without displaying it
    extravagantly. In fact, there will be times when the more dispassionate the
    emotion-provoking description is, the more intense will be the emotion
    aroused.

    Here is a good example of how to stir an emotional response in the au-
    dience by describing a scene. Appealing to the patriotism of his English
    audience, Macaulay wants to arouse their righteous indignation against the
    arrogant, cruel, despotic Surajah Dowlah, so that he can subsequently justify
    the punitive expedition that Lord Clive led against the Indian colony. He
    might have described this same scene in such a way as to stir an English-
    man's pride in the bravery of the colonial troops. But here he describes the
    scene in such a way as to arouse the audience's anger against the native
    troops and their commander. Here is Macaulay's account of the infamous

    Then was committed that great crime, memorable for its singular atrocity, memorable for the tremendous retribution by which it was followed. The English captives were left to the mercy of the guards, and the guards determined to secure them for the night in the prison of the garrison, a chamber known by the fearful name of the Black Hole. Even for a single European malefactor, that dungeon would, in such a climate, have been too close and narrow. The space was only twenty feet square. The air-holes were small and obstructed. It was the summer solstice, the season when the fierce heat of Bengal can scarcely be rendered tolerable to natives of England by lofty halls and by the constant waving of fans. The number of the prisoners was one hundred and forty-six. When they were ordered to enter the cell, they imagined that the soldiers were joking; and, being in high spirits on account of the promise of the Nabob to spare their lives, they laughed and jested at the absurdity of the notion. They soon discovered their mistake. They expostulated; they entreated; but in vain. The guards threatened to cut down all who hesitated. The captives were driven into the cell at the point of the sword, and the door was instantly shut and locked upon them.

    Nothing in history or fiction, not even the story which Ugolino told in the sea of everlasting ice, after he had wiped his bloody lips on the scalp of his murderer, approaches the horrors which were recounted by the few survivors of that night. They cried for mercy. They strove to

    Burst the door. Holwell, who, even in that extremity, retained some presence of mind, offered large bribes to the gaolers. But the answer was that nothing could be done without the Nabob's orders, that the Nabob was asleep, and that he would be angry if anybody woke him. Then the prisoners went mad with despair. They trampled each other down, fought for the places at the windows, fought for the pittance of water with which the cruel mercy of the murderers mocked their agonies, raved, prayed, blasphemed, implored the guards to fire among them. The gaolers in the meantime held lights to the bars, and shouted with laughter at the frantic struggles of their victims. At length the tumult died away in low gaspings and moanings. The day broke. The Nabob had slept off his debauch, and permitted the door to be opened. But it was some time before the soldiers could make a lane for the survivors, by piling up on each side the heaps of corpses on which the burning climate had already begun to do its loathsome work. When at length a passage was made, twenty-three ghastly figures, such as their own mothers would not have known, staggered one by one out of the charnel-house. A pit was instantly dug. The dead bodies, a hundred and twenty-three in number, were flung into it promiscuously and covered up.

    It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the queen of France,
    then the dauphiness, at Versailles; and surely never lighted on this orb,
    which she hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I saw her
    just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she
    just began to move in—glittering like the morning-star, full of life,
    and splendor, and joy. Oh! what a revolution! and what a heart must I have,
    to contemplate without emotion that elevation and that fall! Little did I
    dream when she added titles of veneration to those of enthusiastic, distant,
    respectful love, that she should ever be obliged to carry the sharp antidote
    against disgrace concealed in that bosom; little did I dream that
    I should have lived to see such disasters fallen upon her in a nation of
    gallant men, in a nation of men of honour and of cavaliers. I thought
    ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge
    even a look that threatened her with insult——But the age of chivalry is
    gone.— That of sophisters, economists, and calculators, has succeeded;
    and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever. Never, never more, shall we
    behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex, that proud submission, that
    dignified obedience, that subordination of the heart, which kept alive,
    even in servitude itself, the spirit of an exalted freedom. The unbought
    grace of life, the cheap defence of nations, the nurse of manly sentiment
    and heroic enterprise is gone! It is gone, that sensibility of principle, that
    chastity of honour, which felt a stain like a wound, which inspired courage
    while it mitigated ferocity, which ennobled whatever it touched, and
    under which vice itself lost half its evil, by losing all its grossness.

    Edmund Burke starts to picture the Queen so that the audience can con-
    template her and feel the same emotion that he feels for her. But her pic-
    ture never emerges through the blaze of Burke's "rhetoric." She glitters
    on the horizon "like the morning-star," but we never really get to see her.
    Instead, Burke takes over and stirs up our emotions with the grandiloquent
    rhythm of his prose and with his litany of honorific terms ("titles of venera-
    tion," "men of honour," "gallant men," "age of chivalry," "generous loyalty,"
    "proud submission," "dignified obedience," "chastity of honor," etc.). It is
    somewhat unfair to pluck this purple patch out of its context, because when
    one sees it in its setting in the long pamphlet that Burke wrote, it does not
    strike the reader as being so blatantly sentimental as it appears in isolation.
    But the passage does illustrate very well what a man skilled in the choice
    and manipulation of words can do to the emotions of his audience.

    When Aristotle turns to a consideration of the emotions in Book II, Chap-
    ters 2-17 of the Rhetoric, he intends to supply the student of rhetoric with
    topics for an appeal to the emotions of an audience. Taking some of the
    common emotions, in pairs of opposites—e.g. anger and meekness, love and
    hatred, fear and boldness, shame and shamelessness—he analyzes these emo-
    tions from three angles: (1) their nature; (2) their object—that is, the kind
    of people toward whom we experience the emotion; (3) their exciting causes.
    Aristotle claims that we must know all three things about an emotion if we
    hope to arouse it in others.

    This analysis is one of the earliest attempts at psychology. Admittedly,
    Aristotle's psychology is primitive and inchoate. John Locke and such eight-
    centh-century Scottish philosophers as David Hume, Thomas Reid, Francis
    Hutcheson, and Lord Kames made great advances over Aristotle's primitive
    psychology; and of course the major modern advances in psychology were

But Aristotle's analysis of the emotions can be  \nof value to the student who is not professionally trained in psychology, be-  \ncause his analysis was sound as far as it went and was based on the kind of  \ncommonsense observation of people that even the amateur is capable of  \nmaking. From our knowledge of our own emotional mechanism and from  \nour observation of the emotional reactions of others, we are familiar enough  \nwith the common emotions to be able to manipulate them for persuasive  \npurposes.\n\nThe student should read Aristotle's analysis of the emotions in Book II  \nof the Rhetoric. What we can do here is quote some excerpts from Aristotle's  \nanalysis of anger to show the elementary level and astuteness of Aristotle's  \nnon-professional observations about human emotions. As the student reads  \nthese excerpts, he should pause occasionally to ask himself how well these  \nobservations accord with his own observations of angry people.\n\nAnger may be defined as an impulse, accompanied by pain, to a con-  \nspicuous revenge for a conspicuous slight directed without justification  \ntowards what concerns oneself or towards what concerns one's friends.  \nIf this is a proper definition of anger, it must always be felt towards some  \nparticular individual, e.g. Cleon, and not ‘man' in general....It must  \nalways be attended by a certain pleasure—that which arises from the ex-  \npectation of revenge. For since nobody aims at what he thinks he cannot  \nattain, the angry man is aiming at what he can attain, and the belief that  \nyou will attain your aim is pleasant....It is also attended by a certain  \npleasure because the thoughts dwell upon the act of vengeance, and the  \nimages then called up cause pleasure, like the images called up in dreams.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

Your counterexample should reflect the text''s discussion of non-professional observations about human emotions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the definition''s components and their implications, using logical reasoning to challenge or support Aristotle''s claims.'

    [A discussion of slighting follows, since it is the slight that excites anger.] Now slighting is the actively entertained opinion of something as obviously of no importance.... There are three kinds of slighting—contempt, spite, and insolence. (1) Contempt is one kind of slighting: you feel contempt for what you consider unimportant, and it is just such things that you slight. (2) Spite is another kind; it is a thwarting another man's wishes, not to get something yourself but to prevent his getting it....(3) Insolence is also a form of slighting, since it consists in doing and saying things that cause shame to the victim, not in order that anything may happen to yourself, or because anything has happened to yourself, but simply for the pleasure involved. ...The cause of the pleasure thus enjoyed by the insolent man is that he thinks himself greatly superior to others when ill-treating them.... A man expects to be specially respected by his inferiors in birth, in capacity, in goodness, and generally in anything in which he is much their superior: as where money is concerned a wealthy man looks for respect from a poor man; where speaking is concerned, the man with a turn for oratory looks for respect from one who cannot speak; the ruler demands the respect of the ruled,

    pride themselves upon their appearance get angry with those who show
    contempt for their appearance; and so on in other cases.... Again, we

    our friends ought to treat us well and not badly. We are angry with those
    who have usually treated us with honour or regard, if a change comes
    and they behave to us otherwise: for we think that they feel contempt for
    us or they would still be behaving as they did before.... Further, with
    those who slight us before five classes of people: namely, (1) our rivals,
    (2) those whom we admire, (3) those whom we wish to admire us, (4)
    those for whom we feel reverence, (5) those who feel reverence for us:

- prompt: "The point to make about Aristotle's analysis of the emotions—or any other  \nanalysis of emotions for that matter—is that after the student has read the  \nanalysis he should \"forget\" about it. He should \"forget\" about it in the same  \nsense that someone who has read a \"how-to\" book about batting should forget  \nwhat he has read when he takes a bat in hand and starts swinging at the ball.  \nThe student will not really forget what he has read; he will unconsciously  \nincorporate what he has learned about the emotions into his appeal. This is  \njust another way of urging the student to \"be natural.\" All of us, to one  \ndegree or another, continually appeal to the emotions of others. From our  \ndealings with our fellow men and from our experience with our own emo-  \ntional reactions, we develop certain instincts about the emotions. It is upon  \nthese instincts that we draw when we make an emotional appeal.\n\nSome people's instincts along these lines are more fully developed than  \nother people's. When we say of someone that he has \"quite a line\" or that  \nhe is a \"smooth operator,\" we are probably paying tribute to his natural or  \ndeveloped talent for producing the right emotional touch at the right time.\n\nMaking a conscious study of the emotions and being aware that we are ap-  \npealing to someone's emotions will not necessarily make us more adept at  \nthis kind of appeal. But a conscious knowledge of any art makes it more  \nlikely that we will practice the art skillfully. The man who learned to play  \nthe piano by ear will not be hurt by studying music; but he might very well  \nbe helped to play better.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

    To sum up what we have said about the emotional appeal: Be aware that the emotional appeal plays a vital part in the persuasive process; intellectual conviction is often not enough to move people's will to act. Be alert for emotional appeals from others; don't allow your heart to prompt you to do something that your reason or conscience would later regret. Be natural; let the nature of the subject matter, the occasion, or the audience elicit the appropriate kind and the right amount of emotional appeal. Remember that you cannot command yourself or others to feel emotions; you must conjure up the scene or situation or person that will make people experience the emotions you want to rouse in them. Be aware—as will be pointed out again in the chapter on Arrangement—that people sometimes have to be put into the right emotional mood before they will listen to appeals to reason; at other times it is better to start out with appeals to reason and then rouse the audience to the proper emotional pitch in a grandiloquent peroration.

    The Topics

    Once the student has a subject and has converted it into a sharply defined thesis, he is faced with the task of developing that subject. If he is engaged in persuasive discourse, he must find "arguments" to develop his subject. In the preceding section we saw that anyone bent on persuading others makes use of one or more of the three modes of appeal—the appeal to reason, the appeal to emotions, the appeal of character. If he decides to make use of the appeal to reason, he will develop his arguments inductively or deductively. If he argues deductively, he will resort to the syllogism or, more likely, the enthymeme. If he argues inductively, he will resort to full induction or the example. But for any of these modes of appeal, whether it be logical, emotional, or ethical, he must either have something to say or find something to say.

    Sometimes, from his experience, his education, or his reading, the student
    will already have something to say. On many of the subjects he is asked to
    write about in college classes, the student is able to write a 500- to 800-word
    theme quite readily, for he has a sufficient stock of ideas on those subjects to
    be able to write, as it were, "off the top of his head." He is most likely to
    have a great deal to say when he feels very strongly about something, for
    then ideas seem to come to him unbidden.

    In this chapter, however, we are concerned with the problems of the stu-
    dent who does not have, or thinks he does not have, something to say on
    some given subject. A student can be said to have "nothing to say" when he
    has (1) no ideas at all on a subject, (2) only a few ideas or not enough ideas
    to develop a subject adequately, or (3) a mass of vague, jumbled, inaccurate,
    or untenable ideas. Such a student has to find, to discover, or, to use the rhe-
    torical term, to invent his material. Some measure of invention will be in-
    volved in all four forms of discourse—exposition, argumentation, description,
    and narration. But invention figures most prominently in expository and
    argumentative discourse, because in description or narrative discourse the
    writer has more occasion to "create" his material than to "invent" it.

    What are the student's resources when he has to find his material? His
    chief resources will always be the fruits of his education, his reading, his ob-
    servation, and his reflection. Both Cicero and Quintilian maintained that the
    most valuable background for an orator was a liberal education, because they
    recognized that such a broad education was best calculated to aid a man
    faced with the necessity of inventing arguments on a wide variety of subjects.

    But wide and varied experience, reflection, education, and reading come
    only with time and effort. What about the student who has not yet reaped
    the benefits of experience and study? Is he condemned to be inarticulate?
    Is there some system that can supply the deficiencies of his resources? The
    rhetoricians thought that there was such a system in the topics.

    As we saw in the section of Chapter J devoted to definitions of key terms,
    the topics were the general heads under which were grouped arguments for
    a particular subject or occasion. They were the "regions," the "haunts," the
    "places" where certain categories of arguments resided. There was some sense
    to the attempt by Peter Ramus and his followers in the seventeenth century
    to relegate the topics to the province of logic, for the system of the topics is
    really an outgrowth of the study of how the human mind thinks. The human
    mind, of course, does think about particular things, but its constant tendency
    is to rise above the particulars and to abstract, to generalize, to classify, to
    analyze, and to synthesize. The topics represented the system that the classi-
    cal rhetoricians built upon this tendency of the human mind.

    The rhetoricians saw, for instance, that one of the tendencies of the human
    mind is to seek out the nature of things. So they set up the topic of Defini-
    tion. Another tendency of the human mind is to compare things, and when
    things are compared, one discovers similarities or differences—and the differ-
    ences will be in kind or in degree. When one is presented with a subject, one
    then looks at it to find out whether, for one's specific purpose, it presents an
    opportunity for definition or comparison.

    Perhaps the student will gain a clearer notion of the function of the topics
    if he will think of the topics as "suggesters," as "prompters," as "initiators,"
    as a "checklist," of ideas on some subject. Being general heads or categories,
    the topics "prime the pump," as it were; by suggesting general strategies of
    development, they help to overcome inertia. Just as the starter on an auto-
    mobile turns the motor over until the compression system takes over, so the
    topics initiate a line of thought, which then moves forward on its own mo-
    mentum.

    One of the terms we used in the previous paragraph to clarify the function of the topics was "checklist." The term "checklist" suggests that one goes through the list of topics, one by one, asking oneself whether this particular topic will turn up any material for the development of our subject. In the beginning stages, the student may very well have to do just this. He will eventually discover, however, that some of the many available topics will not be suitable for certain situations. The football coach does not go to his bench indiscriminately when he needs a substitute. He calls from the bench the man who has been trained for a particular position and who can best serve the particular situation that has developed on the field. As Quintilian said, "I would also have students of oratory consider that all forms of argument which I have just set forth cannot be found in every case and that when the subject on which we have to speak has been propounded, it is no use considering each separate type of argument and knocking at the door of each with a view to discovering whether they may chance to serve to prove our point, except while we are in the position of mere learners."—Instit. Orat., V, x, 122. Quintilian envisioned the time when, as the result of study and practice, the student would acquire that "innate penetration" and "power of rapid divination" which would lead him directly to those arguments suited to his particular case. Eventually, he would arrive at the happy condition in which the arguments would "spontaneously follow the thought."

    In the remaining portion of this chapter, we are going to consider the aids to invention under three main heads: (1) the common topics; (2) the special topics; (3) external aids to invention. The common topics will provide the student with a stock of general lines of argument that can be used in the development of any subject. The special topics will provide him with lines of argument especially pertinent to the particular kind of persuasive discourse in which he is engaged—deliberative, judicial, or ceremonial. The external aids to invention will direct the student to some of the standard reference books which will provide him with the facts and figures he may need to substantiate his own arguments or to refute opposing arguments. These aids to invention, it will be noted, are arranged on an ascending scale of specialization: the common topics yield arguments on virtually any subject; the special topics yield arguments for a particular kind of discourse; and the external aids to invention yield data for a specific case. As Aristotle pointed out, the common topics are the aids belonging most properly to rhetoric; as we move up the scale and rely on more specialized knowledge for our arguments, we are moving out of the province of rhetoric and invading the provinces of other disciplines, such as law, history, ethics, politics, science.

- prompt: "We have already discussed definition at some length in an earlier section of  \nthis chapter, where we were reviewing some of the basic principles of logic.  \nHere we will confine our discussion to the uses that rhetoricians made of the  \ntopic. Definition is a way of unfolding what is wrapped up in a subject being  \nexamined. One of the rhetorical uses of this topic is to ascertain the specific  \nissue to be discussed. Opponents in a dispute may be arguing at cross-purposes  \nif they do not clearly establish just what the point at issue is. Therefore, after  \nwe have formulated our thesis, we may find it necessary to define the key  \nterms in our thematic proposition so that our audience will clearly under-  \nstand what we are talking about.  \n\nIn law trials also it is frequently necessary to define the point at issue. In  \nthe court trial, for instance, held in London's Old Bailey in October, 1960,  \nagainst Penguin Books Ltd. for publishing D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatter-  \nley's Lover, it was extremely important that both the prosecution and defense  \ndetermine at the outset just what was the issue at stake. Was Penguin Books  \nbeing prosecuted for violating the provisions of the Obscene Publications Act  \nof 1959? If so, in what way specifically had Penguin Books offended against  \nthis law? Had it offended by publishing an obscene book? If so, what was  \nto be the definition of \"obscene book\" used in this trial? If an obscene book  \nis one that tends to \"corrupt or deprave those who read it,\" what is the mean-  \ning of the terms \"corrupt\" and \"deprave\"? And should there not be some  \ndetermination of who it is that is likely to be depraved or corrupted? And  \ndid Lady Chatterley's Lover fall under the provisions of Section 4 of the  \nAct, which exempt from the charge of obscenity any book judged to be in  \nthe interests of \"science, literature, art, or learning\"?

Using the text''s discussion on defining the point at issue, outline a strategy for clarifying this term.\n- **Step 1**: Describe the potential ambiguity in the definition of ''fair use.''\n- **Step 2**: Propose a method for defining ''fair use'' that aligns with the principles of rhetorical definition (e.g., how to unfold what is wrapped up in the term).\n- **Step 3**: Explain why this clarification is essential for resolving the dispute.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concept of defining the key terms in a thematic proposition and show how this applies to legal or rhetorical arguments.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Critical Thinking on Rhetorical Definition in Legal Reasoning\n\nThe trial of Penguin Books Ltd. involved determining whether Lady Chatterley''s Lover fell under the Obscene Publications Act.

- prompt: "All these questions of definition were important in the trial and had to be  \nposed and resolved at the outset. The student can well imagine how many  \nwords were expended to settle these questions.

Judging from the frequency with  \nwhich students begin their themes with a definition from the dictionary (\"As  \nWebster says,...\"), they would seem to realize instinctively the value of  \ndefinition as a springboard for the development of a subject. The trouble  \nwith most \"As Webster says\" gambits in student themes, however, is that  \nthey serve no useful function.

    world; Professor Huxley says this means knowing Literature. Literature
    is a large word; it may mean everything written with letters or printed
    in a book. Euclid's Elements and Newton's Principia are thus literature.
    All knowledge that reaches us through books is literature. But by litera-
    ture Professor Huxley means belles lettres. He means to make me say,
    that knowing the best which has been thought and said by the modern
    nations is knowing their belles lettres and no more. And this is no suffi-
    cient equipment, he argues, for a criticism of modern life. But as I do
    not mean, by knowing ancient Rome, knowing merely more or less of
    Latin belles lettres, and taking no account of Rome's military, and politi-
    cal, and legal, and administrative work in the world; and as, by knowing
    ancient Greece, I understand knowing her as the giver of Greek art, and
    the guide to a free and right use of reason and to scientific method, and
    the founder of our mathematics, and physics and astronomy and biology
    —I understand knowing her as all this, and not merely knowing certain
    Greek poems, and histories, and treatises, and speeches—so as to the
    knowledge of modern nations also.

    When we are seeking to clarify some of the important terms in a discus-
    sion, we can quote definitions from a dictionary. But the dictionary defini-
    tions will suit our purpose only when these accepted definitions agree with
    our notions. Sometimes, however, we have to devise our own definitions,
    either because the accepted definitions are too vague or because we believe
    them to be erroneous or inadequate. In such cases, we stipulate the meaning
    we will attach to certain terms in our discussion. Because Coleridge found
    that existing definitions of a poem did not accord with his notions of this
    genre, he formulated a definition which he felt was accurate:

    The final definition then, so deduced, may be thus worded. A poem is
    that species of composition which is opposed to works of science by pro-
    posing for its immediate object pleasure, not truth; and from all other
    species (having this object in common with it) it is discriminated by
    proposing to itself such delight from the whole as is compatible with a
    distinct gratification from each component part.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Literary and Scientific Knowledge**\n\nProfessor Huxley distinguishes between general literature and belles lettres. Using his definition, explain how the knowledge of ancient Rome''s military, political, and legal systems would be considered part of literature.\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Reference the text''s assertion that ''All knowledge that reaches us through books is literature''.\n- Contrast this with Huxley''s narrower definition of belles lettres as ''the best which has been thought and said by the modern nations''.\n- Justify your answer with logical reasoning based on the text''s discussion of knowledge acquisition and literary classification.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate between the two definitions and demonstrate understanding of Huxley''s argument about the limitations of belles lettres as a basis for modern life criticism.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Creation of a Distinct Definition**\n\nUsing the example of Coleridge''s definition of a poem provided in the text, construct your own definition for ''literature'' that incorporates the following elements:\n- The purpose of literature (e.g., pleasure, truth, or other values)\n- A distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other forms of expression\n- An example or explanation of how this definition aligns with the text''s discussion of belles lettres and scientific works\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Your definition must be logically consistent with the text''s treatment of definitions in academic discourse.\n- Explain why your definition is more or less adequate than Huxley''s or Coleridge''s based on the text''s criteria for defining terms.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate creative problem-solving in formulating a new definition that reflects the text''s emphasis on defining terms for clarity and purpose.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Knowledge Categories**\n\nThe text discusses the distinction between knowledge gained through books (literature) and practical knowledge (e.g., Rome''s legal systems). Using the definitions provided, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: Explain why a historian studying ancient Rome''s legal system would not be considered to ''know'' the legal system merely by reading about it, according to the text.\n- **Part B**: Apply Huxley''s argument about belles lettres to a modern example (e.g., knowledge of modern technology).\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument that ''knowledge through books'' is a necessary but insufficient condition for understanding any field of study, using the text''s definitions as your foundation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of knowledge classification and demonstrate a logical, well-reasoned argument that applies to both historical and modern contexts.'

    From Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Biographia Literaria, Chapter XIV, 1817.

    Genus

    The topic of definition can be used not only for clarifying the point at issue
    but also for suggesting a line of argument. In the Apology, which is reproduced among the readings at the end of this chapter, we see Socrates using
    the topic of definition to defend himself against the charge of being an atheist.
    Asking what was meant by the "divine," Socrates proposed that it must refer
    either to the gods or to the works or agencies of the gods. He then goes on
    to argue from this definition that he could not be considered an atheist:
    I0O DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    But then you swear in the indictment that I teach and believe in divine
    or spiritual agencies (new or old, no matter for that); at any rate, I be-
    lieve in spiritual agencies—so you swear in the affidavit; and yet if I
    believe in divine things, how can I help believing in spirits or demigods;
    —must I not? To be sure I must; and therefore I may assume that your
    silence gives consent. Now what are spirits or demigods? are they not
    either gods or the sons of gods?

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Socratic Argumentation**\n\nUsing the passage from Biographia Literaria, analyze how Socrates uses the topic of definition to construct his defense against the charge of atheism.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the definition Socrates provides for ''divine'' and explain its significance in his argument.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the definition leads to the conclusion that Socrates cannot be an atheist.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the term ''spiritual agencies'' is equivalent to ''gods or sons of gods'' based on the definitions provided.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of Socratic reasoning and the role of definitions in logical argumentation.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Definitions**\n\nIn the given text, Socrates defines ''divine'' as either ''gods'' or ''the works or agencies of the gods.'' Using this definition, determine whether Socrates can be considered an atheist based on the following statements:\n- ''I believe in spiritual agencies''\n- ''Spirits or demigods are not gods but the sons of gods.''\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Apply Socrates'' definition to the statement ''I believe in spiritual agencies.''\n- **Part B**: Use the given definition of ''spirits or demigods'' to determine whether Socrates believes in gods.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the use of definitions allows Socrates to counter the accusation of atheism.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the definitions provided and demonstrate logical consistency in Socrates'' argument.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Structures**\n\nSocrates uses the definition of ''divine'' to argue that belief in spiritual agencies implies belief in gods. Construct a counterargument using the same rhetorical structure but with a different definition of ''divine.''\n- **Step 1**: Propose an alternative definition for ''divine'' that is not based on gods or their agencies.\n- **Step 2**: Show how this alternative definition would affect Socrates'' argument.\n- **Step 3**: Determine whether the counterargument is valid based on the text''s definitions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate creative reasoning and an understanding of how definitions shape the validity of arguments.'

    In the last sentence of this quotation, Socrates is resorting to an argument based on the first sub-topic under definition—the sub-topic of genus. Whenever the predicate of a proposition puts the subject into a general class of things—"Americans are lovers of freedom," "Suicide is a crime against society"—the subject is, in a sense, being defined, because limits are being fixed to the term. But such propositions can also pose an argument. The rhetorical force of the topic of genus derives from the principle that what is true (or untrue) of the genus must be true (or untrue) of the species. If all men are mortal, then John Smith, if he is a man, must be mortal too. Cicero in his Topica gives this example of an argument from Genus. If a man, he says, bequeathed all the silver in his possession to his wife, a lawyer could argue that the man intended to leave his wife not only all his silver plates and statues and candlesticks but also all the coin in his coffers, for coin is just as much a species of silver as are plates and statues and candlesticks.

    Simply predicating a genus of some subject term will constitute a "proof," however, only when the audience is disposed to grant the truth of the classification. The preacher who declares from the pulpit, "Murder is a grievous sin," can safely presume that his congregation will agree with him. Whenever a speaker or writer cannot presume such ready assent, he must, of course, go on to justify his classification.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Rhetorical Argumentation Using Genus and Species\n\nAnalyze the rhetorical argument presented in the text about inheritance. The original statement is: "If a man bequeathed all the silver in his possession to his wife, a lawyer could argue that the man intended to leave his wife not only all his silver plates and statues and candlesticks but also all the coin in his coffers, for coin is just as much a species of silver as are plates and statues and candlesticks.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the genus and species in this argument. Explain how the concept of genus is used to justify the lawyer''s claim.\n- **Step 2**: Apply this reasoning to a modern legal or business context. Create an analogous argument that uses the principle of genus and species to justify a claim about inheritance or asset distribution.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the principle of genus and species is a valid rhetorical tool in persuasive argumentation, referencing the text''s discussion on classification and truth.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of the text''s explanation of genus and species in rhetoric, as well as original application to a contemporary scenario.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Critical Analysis of Rhetorical Classification\n\nThe text discusses how a proposition like "Americans are lovers of freedom" defines the subject by placing it into a general class. However, such classification can also serve as an argument.\n- **Part A**: Create a new proposition that defines a modern social group (e.g., "Environmentalists are advocates for sustainability"). Use this proposition to construct a rhetorical argument that makes a claim about the group''s behavior or beliefs.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast this argument with the example of "Suicide is a crime against society." Explain how both statements use classification as a rhetorical device, and why the latter is considered a stronger argument in the text.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate whether the classification of "Murder is a grievous sin" can be considered a valid argument in the context of this text. Support your evaluation with reasoning from the text about the role of classification in argumentation.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion on classification as a basis for argumentation and demonstrate an understanding of when such arguments are persuasive or logically sound.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Reasoning About Classification and Assent\n\nThe text explains that a speaker can either presume the audience will agree with their classification or must justify it.\n- **Part A**: Create a hypothetical scenario where a public figure (e.g., a politician) makes a classification claim without justifying it. Identify the potential issues with this approach and explain why justification is necessary, based on the text''s discussion.\n- **Part B**: Construct a classified argument that requires justification. For example, argue that "All students should take the SAT" by defining a classification (e.g., "Students are individuals who need to demonstrate academic ability").\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s distinction between prescriptive and explanatory classification affects the persuasiveness of an argument. Use examples from the text to support your reflection.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how classification functions in rhetoric, the importance of justification, and the differences between prescriptive and explanatory classifications as discussed in the text.'

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Definition and Argumentation**\n\nUsing the passage from Corbett''s *Classical Rhetoric for the Modern Student*, explain how Madison uses definitions to support his argument about republics and pure democracies.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the definition Madison provides for a ''pure democracy.''\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how he contrasts this definition with the characteristics of a republic.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why defining ''a pure democracy'' is a logical premise for his argument about controlling factions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference Madison''s definition and its role in structuring his argument, as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Definitions**\n\nIn the passage, Corbett discusses how defining a state requires identifying its parts and species. Using this concept:\n- **Part A**: Define a ''republic'' based on Madison''s explanation in the text.\n- **Part B**: Construct an analogy to illustrate how defining a ''republic'' helps clarify its function in governance.\n- **Part C**: Explain how defining ''species of a genus'' (as Corbett mentions) is essential for understanding different forms of government.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear application of the text''s definitions and their relevance to political theory.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Rhetorical Structures**\n\nThe text mentions that defining something involves ''enumerating the parts that go to make it up'' and ''designating the species of a genus.''

    One rhetorical use of the topic of division is to lay out the organization of
    the exposition or argument that is to follow. We see an example of this in
    the opening paragraphs of Francis Bacon's discourse on the Idols of the
    Mind:

    The idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human
    understanding and have taken deep root therein, not only beset men's
    minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but even after entrance ob-
    tained, they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and
    trouble us, unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves
    as far as may be against their assaults.

    There are four classes of Idols which beset men's minds. To these for
    distinction's sake I have assigned names, calling the first class Idols of the
    Tribe; the second, Idols of the Cave; the third, Idols of the Marketplace;
    the fourth, Idols of the Theatre.

    From Francis Bacon, Novum Organum, 1620.

    Bacon takes up each of these idols in turn, explains what they are, and shows
    how they inhibit clear thinking.

    Besides this use of division as an organizing principle, it can also be used
    to establish the grounds for an argument. We see an example of this use in
    paragraph 13 of Matthew Arnold's essay reproduced among the readings at
    the end of this chapter:

    Deny the facts altogether, I think, he hardly can. He can hardly deny
    that when we set ourselves to enumerate the powers which go to the
    discovery of arguments

    But then you swear in the indictment that I teach and believe in divine
    or spiritual agencies (new or old, no matter for that); at any rate, I be-
    lieve in spiritual agencies—so you swear in the affidavit; and yet if I
    believe in divine things, how can I help believing in spirits or demigods;
    —must I not? To be sure I must; and therefore J may assume that your
    silence gives consent. Now what are spirits or demigods? are they not
    either gods or the sons of gods?

    In the last sentence of this quotation, Socrates is resorting to an argument based on the first sub-topic under definition—the sub-topic of genus. Whenever the predicate of a proposition puts the subject into a general class of things—"Americans are lovers of freedom," "Suicide is a crime against society"—the subject is, in a sense, being defined, because limits are being fixed to the term. But such propositions can also pose an argument. The rhetorical force of the topic of genus derives from the principle that what is true (or untrue) of the genus must be true (or untrue) of the species. If all men are mortal, then John Smith, if he is a man, must be mortal too. Cicero in his Topica gives this example of an argument from Genus. If a man, he says, bequeathed all the silver in his possession to his wife, a lawyer could argue that the man intended to leave his wife not only all his silver plates and statues and candlesticks but also all the coin in his coffers, for coin is just as much a species of silver as are plates and statues and candlesticks.

    Simply predicating a genus of some subject term will constitute a "proof," however, only when the audience is disposed to grant the truth of the classification. The preacher who declares from the pulpit, "Murder is a grievous sin," can safely presume that his congregation will agree with him. Whenever a speaker or writer cannot presume such ready assent, he must, of course, go on to justify his classification.

    Arnold then uses this division into four "powers" to argue that an education in the humanities is superior to an exclusively scientific education, because the humanities can administer to the development of all of these powers in man, whereas an education in the natural sciences alone cannot.

    Division can also be used to set up an argument by elimination. One can set up alternatives—"A man is a citizen either by birth or by naturalization"—and then by proving (or disproving) one alternative, he disproves (or proves) the other. Or one can enumerate a series of possibilities and eliminate them one by one. For instance, a defense attorney might argue like this:

    A man in these circumstances might steal for any one of these reasons: (A)...3; (B)...3 (C)...3 (D).... Now, we have firmly established that A and B could not possibly have been my client's motives. Furthermore, not even the prosecution has suggested in this trial that C or D could have been my client's motives. Since none of the possible motives are applicable in this case, it is clear that my client is innocent of the charge of stealing.

    If the defense attorney has taken care to consider all the possible motives for this crime, a jury would find this to be a rather persuasive argument.

    We have shown how division can be useful as a principle of organization and as the basis for an argument. In conclusion, we might point out that since explanation is sometimes managed by analysis of a whole into its parts, division can be as useful in expository writing as in argumentative discourse.

    COMPARISON

    The second common topic that we will consider is comparison. For the purposes of learning, explaining, or arguing, we frequently resort to the strategy of bringing two or more things together to study them for similarities, differences, superiority, or inferiority. This tendency to compare things is as natural for man as the tendency to define things. Man in his most primitive

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Division as an Argumentative Strategy**\n\nThe text describes division as a method to set up alternatives or eliminate possibilities. Using the provided example of the defense attorney, construct an argument by elimination to prove that a suspect is not guilty of a crime.\n- **Step 1**: List all possible motives for the crime as alternatives (A, B, C, D).\n- **Step 2**: Disprove two of the motives using evidence.\n- **Step 3**: Show that the prosecution has not presented any support for the remaining motives.\n- **Step 4**: Conclude that, based on elimination, the suspect is innocent.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must follow the structure outlined in the text and explicitly reference at least two specific strategies from the passage (e.g., "by elimination" or "setting up alternatives").\n\n**Answer**: \[The suspect''s innocence is proven by elimination. The possible motives were A, B, C, and D. Evidence disproves A and B, and the prosecution has not presented any support for C or D. Therefore, none of the possible motives apply, and the suspect is innocent.]\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Comparison and Analysis**\n\nThe text discusses comparison as a tool for explaining or arguing, highlighting similarities, differences, superiority, or inferiority. Using the concept of comparison, evaluate the claim: "Education in the humanities is superior to education in the natural sciences."\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least two key qualities of humanities education and two key qualities of natural science education.\n- **Step 2**: Compare these qualities using the strategies described in the text (e.g., "superiority" or "inferiority").\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the humanities provide a more comprehensive development of human powers, as argued by Arnold in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both comparison and the argument presented by Arnold, clearly linking them to the text''s discussion of comparison as a rhetorical strategy.\n\n**Answer**: \[The humanities cultivate imagination, critical thinking, and moral reasoning, while natural sciences focus on logic, empirical analysis, and technical skills. By comparison, the humanities address all human powers, including imagination and morality, whereas sciences alone cannot develop these. Thus, the humanities offer a more comprehensive education.]\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Rhetorical Strategies**\n\nThe text describes division and comparison as key rhetorical strategies. Create a persuasive argument using both division and comparison to support the claim: "A well-rounded education includes both humanities and sciences."\n- **Step 1**: Use division to categorize the components of a well-rounded education (e.g., intellectual, ethical, practical).\n- **Step 2**: Compare the contributions of humanities and sciences to each category.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude that combining both disciplines ensures a balanced development of all human powers.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must explicitly use both division and comparison strategies as outlined in the text, with clear examples from the passage.\n\n**Answer**: \[A well-rounded education includes intellectual, ethical, and practical components. Humanities enhance imagination and ethics, while sciences contribute to logic and technical skills. By comparison, both disciplines are necessary for balanced development, as division shows that no single field addresses all aspects of human potential.]\n'

    The state must early have turned to comparison in an attempt to fathom the bewildering world about him and to establish a scale of values. He discovered that the familiar often helped him to understand the unfamiliar, and he learned that by measuring one thing against another he could discriminate the "more" from the "less." In this section we shall investigate some of the ways in which we can use the topic of comparison in order to discover something to say on a given subject.

    Similarity

    One possible result of comparing things is the detection of similarity, the likeness of two or more things. Similarity is the basic principle behind all inductive argument and all analogy. In induction, we note similarity among a number of instances and make an inference about a further unobserved or unconfirmed instance. Analogy argues that if two things are alike in one or two characteristics, they are probably alike in another characteristic. The rhetorical form of induction, as we have seen, is the example—drawing a probable conclusion from a single instance of similarity. Perhaps the simplest way to differentiate analogy from induction by example is to say that whereas analogy argues from the similarities of dissimilar things, example argues from the similarities of similar things.

    The following is the simplest and commonest form of argument from similarity: "If self-control is a virtue, so is abstinence." Here, noting the similarity in kind between self-control and abstinence and observing that virtue can be predicated of self-control, one infers that abstinence too must be a virtue. The ordinary person resorts to this kind of argument every day: "The student who copies from his neighbor in an examination and the student who illows or encourages his neighbor to copy from him are equally culpable. Both actions are forms of cheating." "The last time we attempted prohibition of the sale of liquor all kinds of abuses resulted. If the present proposal to prohibit the sale of narcotics is passed, we'll experience the same kind of legal and moral chaos."

For example, ''A good education'' and ''A strong foundation in mathematics.''\n- **Step 2**: State that one of these entities (e.g., ''A strong foundation in mathematics'') is essential for success in a specific field (e.g., engineering).\n- **Step 3**: Conclude that the other entity (''A good education'') must also be essential for success in life, based on their similarity.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must explicitly reference the text''s definition of analogy and demonstrate how similarity justifies the inference.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Inductive Argument Structure**\n\nExamine the following inductive argument from the text: ''The student who copies from his neighbor in an examination and the student who illows or encourages his neighbor to copy from him are equally culpable. Both actions are forms of cheating.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the premise and conclusion of the argument.\n- **Step 2**: Explain why this is an inductive argument, citing the text''s definition of induction.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this argument to the example given in the text (the student who copies and the student who encourages copying), explaining how they follow the structure of inductive reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of inductive arguments and how they differ from deductive reasoning, as outlined in the text.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning and Counterargument Construction**\n\nThe text presents the argument: ''If the last time we attempted prohibition of the sale of liquor all kinds of abuses resulted, if the present proposal to prohibit the sale of narcotics is passed, we''ll experience the same kind of legal and moral chaos.''\n- **Part A**: Identify the logical structure of this argument, citing the text''s definition of analogy.\n- **Part B**: Construct a counterargument using the principles of inductive reasoning. Your counterargument must reference at least two instances from the text (e.g., examples of inductive reasoning) and explain how they support your position.\n- **Part C**: Explain why the original argument might be flawed, using logical reasoning based on the text''s discussion of induction and analogy.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of inductive reasoning and analogy to construct a coherent, evidence-based counterargument.'

- prompt: "The student will find many arguments from similarity among the readings  \nin this book. We will look at only one example—this one from the third,  \nfourth, and fifth paragraphs of Samuel Johnson's \"The Liberty of the Pulpit,\"  \nin which he is arguing in defense of the minister who denounced some of  \nhis parishioners from the pulpit:\n\nThe right of censure and rebuke seems necessarily appendant to the  \npastoral office. He, to whom the care of a congregation is entrusted, is  \nconsidered as the shepherd of a flock, as the teacher of a school, as the  \nfather of a family. As a shepherd tending not his own sheep but those  \nof his master, he is answerable for those that stray, and that lose them-  \nselves by straying. But no man can be answerable for losses which he has  \nnot power to prevent, or for vagrancy which he has not authority to  \nrestrain.\n\nAs a teacher giving instruction for wages, and liable to reproach, if  \nthose whom he undertakes to inform make no proficiency, he must have  \nthe power of enforcing attendance, of awakening negligence, and repress-  \ning contradiction.\n\nAs a father, he possesses the paternal authority of admonition, rebuke,  \nand punishment. He cannot, without reducing his office to an empty  \nname, be hindered from the exercise of any practice necessary to stimu-  \n\nlate the idle, to reform the vicious, to check the petulant, and correct the  \nstubborn.\n\nHere Johnson is basing his argument on a comparison between the minis-  \nter and other men in various capacities—the shepherd, the teacher, the father.  \nWhen we make our comparison between things that exist in different orders  \nof being—as, for instance, when we compare the structure of a society to the  \norganization of a beehive—we are moving over into the province of analogy.\n\nWe might have treated analogy along with some of the basic principles of  \nlogic, but analogy, like most rhetorical arguments, produces only probable  \nproof. Hence we will give here some of the principles governing it. Analogy  \nrevolves around the principle that two things which resemble one another  \nin a number of respects resemble one another in a further, unconfirmable  \nrespect. This principle might be graphically represented by this scheme:\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Analogical Reasoning in Rhetoric**\n\nUsing Johnson''s analogy between the minister and a shepherd, teacher, and father, explain how this comparison supports his argument for the minister''s right to censure.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key responsibilities of each role (shepherd, teacher, father) as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the principle of analogy from the text to show how these roles share common attributes that justify the minister''s authority.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this analogy is effective in supporting the argument, referencing the text''s discussion of analogy as a rhetorical device.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of both the minister''s responsibilities and the principles of analogy as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Analogy Principles to Rhetorical Arguments**\n\nCreate a new analogy that supports the claim: "A city''s mayor should have the authority to impose fines on citizens who violate public health codes."\n- **Step 1**: Choose a well-established role or institution that shares similar responsibilities with the mayor.\n- **Step 2**: Outline the key attributes of both the mayor and your chosen analogy.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the principle of analogy (as described in the text) applies to your argument.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analogy must be logically sound and clearly demonstrate the use of the principle that ''things which resemble one another in many respects resemble in further, unconfirmable respects.'''
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Analogy as a Rhetorical Device**\n\nCompare and contrast Johnson''s use of analogy with the general principles of analogy discussed in the text.\n- **Part A**: Analyze how Johnson''s analogy between the minister and shepherd, teacher, father exemplifies the principle of analogy.\n- **Part B**: Discuss why analogy is considered a ''probable proof'' in rhetoric, as stated in the text.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate whether analogy is a reliable method for argumentation, referencing the text''s assertion that ''analogy produces only probable proof.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of analogy with Johnson''s specific use of it to support his argument.'

- prompt: "A 1234— 5§  \nBo1234 —-+» (5)\n\nTwo things, A and B, resemble one another in four known, confirmable respects. From these points of resemblance, we argue that B resembles A in a fifth respect (5 being known and confirmable in the case of A but not in the case of B). As in inductive argument, there is a leap from the known to the unknown. It is because of this inductive leap that analogy achieves probability rather than certainty.\n\nLet us look at an example of argument by analogy:\n\nThere is only one cure for the evils which newly acquired freedom produces; and that cure is freedom. When a prisoner first leaves his cell he cannot bear the light of day: he is unable to discriminate colours or recognise faces. But the remedy is, not to remand him into his dungeon, but to accustom him to the rays of the sun. The blaze of truth and liberty may at first dazzle and bewilder nations which have become half blind in the house of bondage. But let them gaze on, and they will soon be able to bear it. In a few years men learn to reason. The extreme violence of opinion subsides. Hostile theories correct each other. The scattered elements of truth cease to contend, and begin to coalesce. And at length a system of justice and order is educed out of the chaos.\n\nFrom Thomas Babington Macaulay, Essay on Milton, 1825.\n\nMacaulay states his thesis in the first sentence of this passage: he contends that the cure for the evils that attend newly won emancipation is freedom. Noting similarities in the condition of a nation which has won its independence and that of a man who has just been released from prison, he elaborates that similarity to support his contention.\n\nAs we have already pointed out, an analogy does not really prove anything, but it can have persuasive value. Sometimes the nature of one's audience will determine how effective an argument by analogy will be. In most cases, however, the persuasiveness of the analogy will depend largely on adherence to these two principles:\n\n1. The similarities between two things must concern pertinent, significant aspects of the two things.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Inductive Argument Structure**\n\nUsing the text''s definition of inductive argument, analyze the analogy presented in Macaulay''s passage.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the two entities (A and B) that form the analogy.\n- **Step 2**: List the four known, confirmable respects in which A and B resemble one another.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the analogy makes a leap to a fifth, unknown respect (the cure for freedom''s evils is freedom itself).\n- **Step 4**: Justify why this inductive leap results in a probabilistic rather than certain conclusion.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of inductive reasoning and the role of analogy, using specific details from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Analogy Principles**\n\nConstruct an analogy to support the claim that ''education is essential for societal progress.''\n- **Step 1**: Define A and B, where A is ''education'' and B is a known entity that shares relevant similarities with education.\n- **Step 2**: Identify three pertinent, significant aspects in which A and B resemble each other.\n- **Step 3**: Make an inductive leap to a fifth respect, stating how the characteristics of B support the claim about education.\n- **Step 4**: Reflect on how the analogy''s persuasiveness might vary depending on the audience.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analogy must align with the text''s principles and demonstrate logical reasoning based on the provided example.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Analogy''s Persuasive Power**\n\nEvaluate the effectiveness of Macaulay''s analogy in persuading his audience.\n- **Part A**: Identify two aspects of the analogy that could make it persuasive to a reader familiar with prison and freedom.\n- **Part B**: Discuss why the analogy might not be as convincing to a reader who has not experienced imprisonment.\n- **Part C**: Suggest one modification to the analogy that would enhance its persuasiveness for a diverse audience.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s principles and analyze how the analogy''s structure affects its effectiveness in different contexts.'

    2. The analogy must not ignore pertinent dissimilarities between the two things being compared.

    For instance, an anthropologist might try to prove that a certain island in the Pacific was once inhabited by comparing it with another Pacific island known to have been inhabited. He might point out that both islands had palm trees, sandy beaches, placid lagoons, mild climate, and shelter from high winds. However, by ignoring the fact that the questionable island had a very low annual rainfall and that the island was too far from any mainland or other island to make it likely that people could have reached it by sailboat or canoe, he would be ignoring factors that are important to the issue at hand—namely, could people have reached the island, and once they reached it, could they have survived? Most of the time when someone says, "Your analogy doesn't hold," he is exposing an analogy that has avoided consideration of important differences. For instance, in the example quoted above, Macaulay has pointed out a number of similarities between the situation of a released prisoner and the situation of an emancipated nation. But are there not some relevant dissimilarities between the two situations? Is there not a significant difference between a nation of people and a single person—a difference that might justify a difference of treatment?

    Analogy is often used too for purposes of exposition. By comparing something unfamiliar or abstruse with something familiar, one can facilitate his explanation. There is an example of this use in paragraph 21 of Dr. Oppenheimer's essay reproduced at the end of this chapter. Dr. Oppenheimer uses the analogy of a tree to show how knowledge tends to ramify:

    How then does it go? In studying the different parts of nature, one explores with different instruments, explores different objects, and one gets a branching of what at one time had been common talk, common sense. Each branch develops new instruments, ideas, words suitable for describing that part of the world of nature. This tree-like structure, all growing from the common trunk of man's common primordial experience, has branches no longer associated with the same question, nor the same words and techniques. The unity of science, apart from the fact that it all has a common origin in man's ordinary life, is not a unity of deriving one part from another, nor of finding an identity between one part and another, between let us say, genetics and topology, to take two impossible examples, where there is indeed some connection.

    From J. Robert Oppenheimer, "On Science and Culture."

    In paragraph 19 of Edmund Burke's "Letter to a Noble Lord," reproduced among the readings in this chapter, we see another use being made of analogy. By comparing his present situation with that of a fallen oak tree, Burke is seeking to stir the emotions of his audience:

    But a Disposer whose power we are little able to resist and whose wisdom it behooves us not at all to dispute, has ordained it in another manner and (whatever my querulous weakness might suggest) a far better. The storm has gone over me; and I am like one of those old oaks which the late hurricane has scattered about me. I am stripped of all my honours, I am torn up by the roots and lie prostrate on the earth! There, and prostrate there, I most unfeignedly recognize the Divine justice and in some degree submit to it.

    Another possible result of comparing two or more things is a detection of differences. At some time in his academic career, the student must have been asked to answer an essay-question that begins with the formula, "Compare and contrast...." The "compare" part of that formula is asking the student to set forth the similarities between things; the "contrast" part of the formula is asking the student to note the differences between things. In the eighteenth century, it was common for those critics who were influenced by John Locke's psychology of knowledge to define wit, the imaginative faculty, as the faculty that saw resemblances between things and to define judgment, the rational faculty, as the faculty that saw differences between things. Wit, in other words, was the synthetic faculty, and judgment was the analytic faculty. It would be well to develop both judgment and wit.

    Rhetoricians made use of the topic of difference to gather arguments for confirmation or refutation. Edmund Burke's essay at the end of this chapter, "Letter to a Noble Lord," is a good essay for the student to study for an illustration of the operation of the topic of difference. In this apologia, Burke bases most of his defense on difference. He spends a great deal of time, for instance, contrasting the pension that he has received from the government with the pension that the Duke of Bedford's family received many years ago. Here is just one example, from paragraph 3 of the essay, of Burke's argument from differences:

    I really am at a loss to draw any sort of parallel between the public merits of his Grace, by which he justifies the grants he holds, and these services of mine, on the favorable construction of which I have obtained what his Grace so much disapproves. In private life, I have not at all the honour of acquaintance with the noble Duke. But I ought to presume, and it costs me nothing to do so, that he abundantly deserves the esteem and love of all who live with him. But as to public service, why truly it would not be more ridiculous for me to compare myself in rank, in fortune, in splendid descent, in youth, strength, or figure, with the Duke of Bedford, than to make a parallel between his services and my attempts to be useful to my country. It would not be gross adulation, but uncivil irony, to say that he has any public merit of his own to keep alive the idea of the services by which his vast landed pensions were obtained. My merits, whatever they are, are original and personal; his are derivative. It is his ancestor, the original pensioner, that has laid up this inexhaustible fund of merit, which makes his Grace so very delicate and exceptionable about the merit of all other grantees of the Crown. Had he permitted me to remain in quiet, I should have said, 'tis his estate; that's enough. It is his by law; what have I to do with it or its history? He would naturally have said on his side, 'tis this man's fortune — He is as good now as my ancestor was two hundred and fifty years ago. I am a young man with very old pensions; he is an old man with very young pensions—that's all.

    The student can study the topic of difference in some of the other readings reproduced at the end of this chapter. In paragraph 6, for instance, of Macaulay's "The Character of Boswell," he will note how the author attempts to influence our opinion of his subject by pointing out that whereas in the case of most writers we admire both the writer and his book, in the case of Boswell, we despise the writer and admire his book. In paragraph 15 of The Federalist, No. 10, James Madison, after defining the terms "pure democracy" and "republic," goes on to contrast the efficiency of these two forms of government. Matthew Arnold makes frequent use of the topic of difference in his essay "Literature and Science"; in paragraph 11 of that essay, to pick out only one example, we see Arnold marking the differences between the physical sciences ("knowledge of things") and the humanities ("knowledge of words"). In paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of "On Science and Culture," we see Dr. Oppenheimer contrasting the culture of former times, which tended to preserve and consolidate the body of knowledge, with the culture of modern times, which tends to encourage and accelerate changes in knowledge. A study of these and other examples should convince the student of how common the topic of difference is in discourse and of how useful this topic can be for purposes of exposition or persuasion.

    Degree

    More and less—the topic to which we have attached the label "degree"—was one of the four common topics that Aristotle discussed in his Rhetoric. Aristotle perceived that in comparing things we sometimes discover, not a difference in kind, as in the previous topic, but a difference in degree. One thing will be better than another; or it will be worse. The relevance of this fact for rhetoric is that sometimes when we are seeking to persuade others to do something or to accept something, we have to show our audience that the choice before them is not between a good and an evil but between a greater good and a lesser good—or between a greater evil and a lesser evil.

    Questions of degree are not easy to settle, mainly because judgments about
    such a difference are usually relative and subjective. To help orators find
    arguments to decide questions of degree, Aristotle provided a set of criteria
    in Book I, Chapter 7 of his Rhetoric. Here are some of his criteria:

    1. A greater number of things can be considered more desirable
    than a smaller number of the same things.

    Deciding questions of degree by numerical superiority must be attended with
    certain cautions. Numerical superiority, first of all, must be reckoned in re-
    gard to things of the same species. Ten one-dollar bills are obviously a greater
    good than five one-dollar bills; but ten one-dollar bills are not a greater good
    than five ten-dollar bills. Then too numerical superiority becomes a helpful
    determinant of degree only when all other things are equal. A congressman
    might argue that a tax bill which will bring in four billion dollars of revenue
    is a better proposal than the tax bill which will bring in only three billion
    dollars. But the congressman's argument will persuade his colleagues only if
    a number of other considerations are equal: if both bills are equally just; if
    both bills are equally enforceable; if both bills can be administered at rela-
    tively equal cost. Numerical superiority would also be qualified by the qual-
    ity of the things involved. It might be argued, for instance, that the football
    coach who recruited twenty players had done a better job than the coach
    who recruited only fifteen players. But the coach who had recruited only
    fifteen players might actually have engaged a greater number of superior
    athletes or have recruited two or three players who are worth more to a team
    than the entire twenty players hired by the other coach.
    THE COMMON TOPICS I0G

    2. That which is an end is a greater good than that which is only
    a means.

    The principle underlying this criterion is that a means is desirable only for
    the sake of something else; but an end is desirable for its own sake. Health,
    for instance, is a greater good than exercise, because we indulge in exercise
    for the sake of acquiring or maintaining health. Exercise is a means to a
    good outside itself; but in relation to exercise, health is an end, something
    which is desirable for its own sake.

    3. What is scarce is greater than what is abundant.

Apply Aristotle''s first criterion on degree (numerical superiority) to evaluate which policy is more beneficial.\n- **Step 1**: Justify why numerical superiority alone might not determine the better policy, using the text''s cautionary examples.\n- **Step 2**: Propose an alternative criterion from the text that could be used to compare these policies.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the alternative criterion might lead to a different conclusion than numerical superiority.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s cautionary examples and demonstrate understanding of how different criteria can yield conflicting conclusions about degree questions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical End/Means Distinction**\n\nIn a business proposal, an executive argues that ''this product is superior because it helps companies achieve greater profitability.'' Using Aristotle''s second criterion (end vs. means), evaluate the validity of this argument.\n- **Part A**: Identify whether the executive''s claim is using a means or an end.\n- **Part B**: Determine if this argument would be considered valid under Aristotle''s framework.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterargument that could be used to challenge the executive''s claim, using the text''s explanation of ends and means.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly distinguish between ends and means, as per the text, and demonstrate an understanding of how this distinction affects the evaluation of degree questions.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Scarcity and Value**\n\nThe text states that ''what is scarce is greater than what is abundant.'' Apply this criterion to a scenario where two cities have different approaches to water management: City X manages its water efficiently, while City Y has a large supply of water but inefficient distribution.\n- **Part A**: Determine which city''s approach would be considered more valuable according to the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain why scarcity might not always be the best indicator of value, using examples from the text.\n- **Part C**: Propose a scenario where scarcity would be an appropriate criterion for determining value, and explain why.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s explanation of scarcity and demonstrate an ability to apply this criterion in different contexts.'

    This principle is the basis of most monetary systems. Silver coins are of greater value than copper coins because silver is a scarcer metal than copper; gold is more valuable than silver for the same reason. We should be aware, however, that in some circumstances the opposite principle could be used as criterion of superior value. We could argue that what is abundant is a greater good than what is scarce because the abundant is more useful. Thus though water is more abundant than gold, in some circumstances water would be judged the greater good because it was more useful.

    4. What men of practical wisdom would choose is a greater good than what ignorant men would choose.

    Plato's many arguments about the "one" and the "many" were examples of the application of this criterion. What is involved here is the impressiveness of authority. As a practical matter, we all rely on the judgments of experts. Where judgments about value conflict, the antecedent probability is that the judgment of the expert is more reliable than that of the amateur. Under the (fifth of the common topics, we shall discuss at some length the part that testimony or informed opinion plays in exposition and argument.

    5. What the majority of men would choose is better than what the minority would choose.

    ‘This criterion, the opposite of the previous one, smacks very much of the horse-counting method of determining worth. "If you want to find out what the most worthwhile current novels are, consult the best-seller lists." "The better candidate is the one the people elect." This criterion will have persistent value with people who conceive of the good in the Aristotelian sense of that which is desirable for its own sake. Desirability is a quite different thing from worth. We all know that what all men or most men desire is not always a good in the moral or aesthetic sense. But if, in any given dis-

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Value Criteria in Rhetoric\n\nCompare and contrast the two criteria for determining value presented in the text: (1) the principle of scarcity (scarce is valuable) and (2) the principle of abundance (abundant is valuable).\n- **Step 1**: Define each criterion using the text''s examples (e.g., silver vs. copper, water vs. gold).\n- **Step 2**: Analyze the conditions under which each criterion would be applied, referencing Plato''s ''one'' and ''many'' arguments.\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate the text''s assertion that these criteria are complementary, not contradictory, by considering how they might coexist in different contexts.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of authority and practical wisdom, showing understanding of how these criteria influence value judgments in rhetoric.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Logical Analysis of Majority vs. Minority Judgment\n\nExamine the text''s argument that ''what the majority of men would choose is better than what the minority would choose.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the rhetorical strategy used in this criterion, referencing the ''horse-counting method'' and the Aristotelian conception of good.\n- **Step 2**: Critique the text''s assertion by considering a scenario where majority preference might conflict with moral or aesthetic value (e.g., popularity of harmful content).\n- **Step 3**: Propose a modified criterion that balances both majority preference and moral worth, using examples from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an ability to apply logical reasoning to the text''s arguments about value and judgment.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Integration of Authority and Expert Judgment\n\nThe text discusses the importance of expert opinion in determining value. Construct an argument that combines both criteria (scarcity, abundance, and majority preference) to justify the value of a modern technological innovation (e.g., artificial intelligence).\n- **Step 1**: Use the scarcity criterion to argue for AI''s value based on its limited availability or specialized application.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the abundance criterion to argue for AI''s value based on its widespread accessibility and utility.\n- **Step 3**: Incorporate the majority preference criterion by referencing trends in public opinion or expert consensus.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must show how the text''s value criteria can be synthesized to support a modern technological innovation, demonstrating understanding of both rhetorical and ethical considerations.'

    Advertisers make great use of this criterion. "More people smoke Camels than any other cigarette." Sometimes of course what all men or most men choose is the worthiest good. There is a certain presumptive evidence that the product most people buy is the best product. Other factors, of course, influence the popularity of a product—its price, its prestige value, its advertising—but if there is any validity to the maxim "You can't fool all of the people all of the time," one is inclined to believe that it is the quality of the product that maintains sales at a high level.

    6. What men would really like to possess is a greater good than what men would merely like to give the impression of possessing.

    In The Prince, Machiavelli said that a reputation for virtue was so important to the image a ruler needs to create that if he was not really a virtuous man he must at least give the appearance of being a virtuous man. Tested by this sixth criterion, Machiavelli's view suggests that power is a greater good than virtue, because power is what the ruler really wants and in order to get it he is ready to assume a mask of virtue. Aristotle uses a similar example: one could argue that health is a greater good than justice, because while men can be content with the mere reputation for being just, men prefer being healthy to only seeming healthy.

    7. If a thing does not exist where it is more likely to exist, it will not exist where it is less likely to exist.

    This is a line of argument to which logicians commonly assign the Latin label a fortiori: ("from the stronger"). John Donne, in the sonnet that depreciates the power and dreadfulness of death, used an a fortiori argument to develop his thesis. Here are the first six lines of that sonnet:

    Death, be not proud, though some have called thee
    Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so,

    For those, whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow,
    Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.

    From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,

    Much pleasure, then from thee much more must flow,

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of the ''Greater Good'' Principle**\n\nUsing the reasoning presented in the text, evaluate whether a business should prioritize actual customer satisfaction over just maintaining a positive public image.\n- **Step 1**: Apply the sixth criterion that ''what men would really like to possess is a greater good than what they would merely like to give the impression of possessing.''\n- **Step 2**: Reference Machiavelli''s and Aristotle''s examples to explain how the ''greater good'' concept applies to business decisions.\n- **Step 3**: Justify whether prioritizing actual satisfaction aligns with the idea of a greater good, considering that customers might not always be aware of their true preferences.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s reasoning about the ''greater good'' and demonstrate understanding of how this principle applies to business ethics.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of the ''A Fortiori'' Argument**\n\nConstruct a logical argument using the ''a fortiori'' reasoning (from the stronger) to support the claim that ''the best books are those that are most widely read.''\n- **Step 1**: Define the ''a fortiori'' argument as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Establish a stronger premise (e.g., ''books that are most widely read are more likely to be good'') and a weaker premise (e.g., ''books that are less widely read may still be good'').\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the stronger premise leads to the conclusion that the best books are those most widely read, using examples from the text (e.g., Donne''s sonnet).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must adhere to the structure of the ''a fortiori'' reasoning and directly reference examples from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Public Perception vs. Reality**\n\nEvaluate the claim that ''a company''s reputation is more important than its actual quality.''\n- **Step 1**: Use the sixth criterion to argue that a company''s reputation (image) is a ''greater good'' than its actual quality.\n- **Step 2**: Reference Machiavelli''s view that rulers must give the appearance of virtue even if they are not truly virtuous.\n- **Step 3**: Construct a counterargument that actual quality is essential for long-term success, using the ''a fortiori'' reasoning from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must balance both perspectives, clearly stating which is more important based on the text''s reasoning and supporting your conclusion with logical arguments from the text.'

    A paraphrase of the elliptical syntax in lines 5 and 6 will clarify the a fortiori argument implicit in those lines. In line 5, Donne says that rest and sleep are like death, are "imitations" of death. We all know that we derive a great deal of pleasure from rest and sleep; therefore, we should derive even more pleasure from that which they imitate, from death. If so much pleasure from the lesser thing, how much more pleasure from the greater thing. Therefore death cannot be as dreadful as we have been led to believe.

    An a fortiori argument can work in two directions: (1) from the greater to the lesser, or (2) from the lesser to the greater. Donne starts out with a consideration of the lesser and then makes an inference about the greater. An a fortiori argument that works in the other direction would take a form like this: "If a man would steal from a friend, he would steal from a stranger."

    An a fortiori argument sets up two possibilities, one of which will be more probable than the other. Whatever can be affirmed about the less probable can be affirmed with even greater force about the more probable. Like most rhetorical arguments, an a fortiori argument does not lead to certainty; it leads to a more or less strong probability.

    A number of arguments from the topic of degree are pointed out in the analyses of whole essays in this and the following chapter. Here are two leads to arguments from degree in some of the readings that are not analyzed:

    He charged his minister, in a publick paper, with scandal, defamation, and falsehood. The minister, thus reproached, had his own character to vindicate, upon which his pastoral authority must necessarily depend. To be charged with a defamatory lie is an injury which no man patiently endures in common life. To be charged with polluting the pastoral office with scandal and falsehood, was a violation of character still more atrociouss, as it affected not only his personal but his clerical veracity.

    If then there is to be separation and option between humane letters on the one hand and the natural sciences on the other, the great majority of mankind, all who have not exceptional and over-powering aptitudes for the study of nature, would do well, I cannot but think, to choose to be educated in humane letters rather than in the natural sciences. Letters will call out their being at more points, will make them live more.

    RELATIONSHIP

    Cause and Effect

    The first sub-topic that we will consider under the general head of relationship is cause and effect. Just as men have always exhibited a desire to know the nature of things and a curiosity about likenesses and differences, so they have always felt the urge to discover the "why" of something. A child exhibits the first glimmerings of rationality when he passes from the stage of asking the question "what" about the world around him to the stage of asking the question "why." "What is that, Daddy?" "That's rain, son. It's water that falls from those dark clouds." "Why, Daddy?" Having noted an effect, the child begins to ask questions about the cause.

    Men have traditionally accepted as axiomatic the principle that every effect must have a cause. Many of the arguments for the existence of God, for instance, have been based on this principle. Having observed the universe in its wonderful immensity, harmony, and complexity, men have postulated that this world had its beginnings in God, the Prime Mover, the Uncaused Cause.

    Cause-and-effect relationships constitute one of the most fruitful sources of arguments. But before we explore the rhetorical uses of cause and effect, we should review a few principles governing this kind of reasoning.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Cause and Effect in Rhetorical Reasoning**\n\nUsing the definition of cause-and-effect relationships provided in the text, analyze how the argument for God''s existence as an ''Uncaused Cause'' is valid.\n- **Step 1**: Explain the principle of causality as described in the text (every effect has a cause).\n- **Step 2**: Apply this principle to the argument that the universe requires a cause (God).\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the concept of an ''Uncaused Cause'' is not a contradiction, based on the text''s discussion of cause and effect.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the principles of causality with the argument for a Prime Mover and explicitly address the logical consistency of an ''Uncaused Cause.'''
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Reasoning to Literature and Science**\n\nThe text contrasts the study of humane letters with the natural sciences, quoting Matthew Arnold''s statement that "...the great majority of mankind... would do well to choose to be educated in humane letters rather than in the natural sciences."\n- **Part A**: Explain how the concept of cause and effect relates to the argument presented in Arnold''s quote.\n- **Part B**: Construct an analogy using cause and effect to support Arnold''s assertion, referencing the text''s discussion of rationality in children.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate whether the argument for humanities over sciences is valid, using cause and effect reasoning based on the text''s principles.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate cause-and-effect reasoning with Arnold''s argument and demonstrate understanding of the text''s rhetorical framework.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Cause and Effect in Rhetoric**\n\nUsing the principles of cause and effect from the text, analyze the rhetorical strategy used in the argument for God''s existence as an ''Uncaused Cause.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the effect being explained (the existence of the universe).\n- **Step 2**: Determine the cause proposed (God as the Prime Mover).\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the concept of an ''Uncaused Cause'' fits within the text''s discussion of cause and effect, avoiding logical contradictions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of cause and effect in rhetoric, apply it to the argument for God''s existence, and resolve any potential logical inconsistencies.'

- prompt: |-
    First of all, we must recognize that an effect could have a number of possible causes. In the case of a broken window, for instance, we know that a number of things could account for that broken window. Someone could have thrown a rock at the window; the wind could have broken the window; tremors in the earth could have broken the window; a sonic boom from a passing jet airplane could have broken the window. Although these are all possible causes of the broken window, only one of these will be the cause of this broken window. The task is to determine which cause. Most detective stories start out with a murder. The detective must sort out, from all the possible or probable causes, the causes of this particular murder; he must discover the murderer.

    Secondly, the cause that we assign for an effect must be capable of producing the effect. It must, in other words, be an adequate cause. If a detective discovers that a robust man was strangled to death, he immediately rules out as a suspect the little old maiden aunt, the twelve-year-old nephew of the deceased, and the 114-pound chambermaid. All of these people are capable of murdering someone, even by strangling a person, but they could not have strangled the powerful man stretched out on the carpet in the library. Now, there is the ju-jitsu artist who had been paying court to the victim's daughter....

    Thirdly, once we have a probable and adequate cause for something, we must consider whether there are other adequate causes for the effect. Yes, there was that ju-jitsu artist, but there was also that tall, gangly butler and that wiry, irascible gardener. They too could have strangled the man.

    Fourthly, we must consider whether the conditions or circumstances were such that the potential cause could operate. In a controlled experiment—like those that a chemist conducts in the laboratory—such conditions as time, temperature, humidity, proportions, can be stabilized or varied to test whether the hypothetical cause is the real cause. In the case of human beings acting
    as efficient causes, such conditions as opportunity and motivation must be considered.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing the Broken Window Scenario**\n\nIn the text, the author discusses how multiple causes could lead to an effect, using the example of a broken window.\n- **Task A**: Using the logic presented in the text, identify which of the following could be a possible cause for the broken window: a rock thrown by a person, wind, an earthquake, or a sonic boom from a jet.\n- **Task B**: According to the text, what is the key criterion for determining which cause is the actual one?\n- **Task C**: Explain how the detective''s process of elimination relates to the text''s discussion about checking for adequate causes.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include a clear explanation of the logical process used to determine the cause, referencing specific concepts from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluating the Strangulation Case**\n\nIn the text, a detective is presented with various suspects in a murder case. The author explains that while some individuals may be capable of committing the crime, they may not be adequate causes for the specific effect (the murder).\n- **Task A**: According to the text, what must be true about a potential cause for it to be considered an adequate cause?\n- **Task B**: The text mentions that the ju-jitsu artist, the tall butler, and the wiry gardener are all possible suspects. Why might the detective consider these individuals as adequate causes?\n- **Task C**: The author states that conditions like opportunity and motivation must be considered in human cases. How does this relate to the concept of ''adequate causes'' discussed in the text?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of how adequacy and contextual conditions determine the validity of a potential cause.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Applying Scientific Method to Human Behavior**\n\nThe text draws a parallel between controlled experiments in chemistry and the investigation of human behavior.\n- **Task A**: According to the text, what is the purpose of controlling variables in a controlled experiment?\n- **Task B**: How does the text suggest that detectives should approach human behavior in a way similar to scientists conducting experiments?\n- **Task C**: The author mentions that opportunity and motivation are important factors. Why would these be considered ''conditions'' in the context of determining a cause?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the scientific method with the detective''s reasoning process as described in the text.'

- prompt: |-
    Lastly, we must also consider whether the hypothetical cause always produces an effect and whether it invariably produces the same effect. In short, we must establish not only that a putative cause could produce a particular effect but also that it would produce the effect.

    One of the commonest errors in cause-and-effect reasoning is the fallacy usually referred to by the Latin label post hoc ergo propter hoc ("after this, therefore because of this"). This is the error of supposing that where there is a time relationship between two events there is also a cause-and-effect relationship. A number of superstitions are built upon this fallacy. John Smith was hit by a car at the intersection of Fifth and Main Streets because five minutes before, he had walked under a painter's ladder. It is understandable, of course, why men tend to suppose that when one event chronologically follows another event the later event was caused by the earlier event. But we must prove the cause-and-effect relationship; we cannot presume relationship. Try proving that John Smith's having walked under a ladder resulted in his being hit by a car. On the face of it, the action does not seem to be a suitable or adequate cause for the effect. His walking under the ladder could indicate general carelessness, and that carelessness could explain why he was hit while crossing a busy intersection. But there was no direct relationship between the two events.

    The principles we have been reviewing in connection with cause-and-effect relationships are the principles normally discussed in a logic class. Nevertheless, a conscientious rhetorician must be aware of these principles too and must observe them in his presentation of arguments. He must be especially careful to observe these principles when he is addressing a sophisticated audience that will not accept slipshod causal reasoning.

- prompt: "In persuasive discourse, arguments based on causal relationships work in two directions. We can argue from an effect back to a cause, or we can start with a cause and argue that it will produce a particular effect or effects. We see an instance of an argument from cause to effect in Jonathan Swift's *A Modest Proposal*. After making his \"modest proposal\" that the poor people of Ireland should sell their year-old infants as table fare for the wealthy, he points out that the implementation of his proposal would have these effects:\n\nI have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my subject. I think the advantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and many, as well as of the highest importance.\n\nFor first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the number of Papists, with whom we are yearly overrun, being the principal breeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous enemies. ...\n  \nIt 4 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS\n\nSecondly, the poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own, which by law may be made liable to distress and help to pay their landlords rent, their corn and cattle being seized, and money a thing unknown.\n\nThirdly, Whereas the maintenance of an hundred thousand children, from two years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at less than ten shillings a piece per annum, the nation's stock will be thereby increased fifty thousand pounds per annum, besides the profit of a new dish, introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the kingdom, who have any refinement in taste, and the money will circulate among ourselves, the goods being entirely of our own growth and manufacture.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

Explain how this is a cause-effect relationship, using language from the text to support your analysis.\n- **Part B**: Consider Swift''s third point: "the nation''s stock will be thereby increased fifty thousand pounds per annum."

    Swift goes on to name a fourth, fifth, and sixth effect of his proposal, but
    this is enough to illustrate our point. As any schoolboy knows who has read
    this famous ironical essay, Swift was not seriously offering a proposal that
    he expects the government to adopt, but the point is that he was using the
    terminology and the kind of argument that a hard-headed mercantilist of
    the eighteenth century might have used in trying to persuade others that
    "people represent the riches of a nation." If it is fairly self-evident, as in
    this instance, that the cause will produce the proposed effects and if the
    proposed effects seem desirable to the audience, the mere recital of the effects
    will be persuasive.

    If, on the other hand, it is not self-evident that the proposed effects will
    follow from a particular cause, then one must prove his claims. Before Dr.
    Jonas Salk, for instance, won approval from the U.S. Department of Health,
    Education, and Welfare to put his vaccine on the market, he had to present
    ample evidence that it would, as he claimed, prevent polio. With something
    as crucial as a vaccine one would have to present proof sufficient to create
    virtual certainty about its effects. In many affairs of state, however, such as a
    proposal that a reduction in occupation taxes would attract dozens of new
    industries to a community, a legislator would have to produce only a high
    degree of probability in order to persuade his colleagues.

    The other way to argue causally is from effect back to a cause. We see
    James Madison arguing from effect to cause in paragraph 7 of The Federalist,

    No. 10:

    But the most common and durable source of factions has been the various
    and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who
    are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those
    who are creditors and those who are debtors fall under a like discrimination.
    A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a
    moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in
    civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by dif-
    ferent sentiments and views. The regulation of these various and interfer-

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Causal Argumentation in Political Discourse**\n\nExamine the example of Dr. Jonas Salk''s vaccine approval process as described in the text and apply it to a modern political scenario.\n- **Part A**: Describe how Salk''s requirement for ''ample evidence'' reflects the broader principle of ''proof sufficient to create virtual certainty.''\n- **Part B**: Contrast this with the scenario where a legislator proposes a tax reduction to attract new industries. Explain why the required evidence is less stringent in this case.\n- **Part C**: Use the text''s discussion of ''high degree of probability'' to construct an argument for why some political decisions can be persuasive without absolute proof.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s examples and explicitly compare the evidentiary standards in different political contexts.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Causality**\n\nAnalyze the argument from effect to cause presented in James Madison''s *The Federalist*, No. 10, as described in the text.\n- **Part A**: Identify the key premise that Madison uses to argue that ''the various and unequal distribution of property'' is the most common cause of factions.\n- **Part B**: Explain how this causal reasoning relates to the text''s discussion of ''regulation of these various and interfering interests.''\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s examples of Swift and Madison illustrate the two primary methods of causal argumentation (from cause to effect, and from effect to cause).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of both types of causal reasoning and their application in different rhetorical contexts.'

    interests forms the principal task of modern legislation and involves
    the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations
    of the government.

    Again it may be well to point out that in human affairs it is not always neces-
    sary to demonstrate, with the same rigorous certainty that we expect in logic
    or science, that a particular effect was produced by a certain cause and no
    other. It is often sufficient that we produce a high degree of probability.

    Antecedent and Consequence

    Closely allied to the topic of cause and effect is the topic of antecedent and
    consequence. In fact, the latter may be regarded as merely a looser form of
    the cause-and-effect arguments practiced in logic. The etymology of the term
    consequence (the Latin verb segut, to follow) is the key to an understanding
    of the way in which rhetoric used this topic. The persuader pursues this line
    of argument: given this situation (the antecedent), what follows (the con-
    sequence) from this? If he can detect a cause-and-effect relationship between
    the antecedent and consequence, he will avail himself of the relationship to
    strengthen his case. But he will also make use of less compelling kinds of
    consequences (things that follow). For instance, he might argue that since
    Jane Smith was not the legal wife of John Smith at the time of his death, it
    follows that she is not entitled to his possessions. Here there is no cause-and-
    effect relationship, but some judgment does follow from the existent situation.

    We frequently use this kind of antecedent-consequence argument in our
    everyday affairs. "If girls are admitted to the university as full-time students,
    they must be accorded the same rights and privileges as the male students."
    "If these students violated the university's regulations about drinking at
    school-sponsored gatherings, they must be suspended." "If this man is a nat-
    ural-born citizen, he has the right to vote." Sometimes the consequence fol-
    lows from the definition of the antecedent term. For example, "If this figure
    is a square, it has four right-angles" or "If this creature is a man, he is a
    rational animal."

    The student should note that there is usually an implied premise whenever
    1 argument takes this form. When we say, "If girls are admitted to the
    lniversity as full-time students, they must be accorded the same rights and
    privileges as the male students,' we imply that all full-time students are
    cnutled to the same rights and privileges. Oftentimes it is this unexpressed
    premise, this assumption, that is the vulnerable spot in an argument. So
    when one is looking for an opening to refute such an argument, he would
    do well to search for the assumption.

    Vhe student will recall that in the earlier section of this chapter, where
    some of the main principles of logic were reviewed, the antecedent-conse-
    quence proposition often served as the major premise of the hypothetical
    syllogism. ("If this man is a natural-born citizen, he has the right to vote."
    "This man zs a natural-born citizen." "Therefore, he has a right to vote.")
    The student should review the rules governing the validity of such deductive
    reasoning so that he may be guided in formulating his own antecedent-conse-
    quence arguments and in detecting fallacies in the arguments that others
    present.

    Here are a few examples of arguments from antecedent and consequence
    from the readings at the end of this chapter:

    We cannot know all the best thoughts and sayings of the Greeks unless
    we know what they thought about natural phenomena. We cannot fully
    apprehend their criticism of life unless we understand the extent to which
    that criticism was affected by scientific conceptions. We falsely pretend to
    be the inheritors of their culture, unless we are penetrated, as the best
    minds among them were, with an unhesitating faith that the free em-
    ployment of reason, in accordance with scientific method, is the sole
    method of reaching truth.

    From paragraph 30 of Thomas Henry Huxley, "Science and Culture."

    Of all this there is possibility, and of all this there is danger. But if
    possibility of evil be to exclude good, no good ever can be done. If noth-
    ing is to be attempted in which there is danger, we must all sink into
    hopeless inactivity.

    There are several points to keep in mind. One would naturally think that if we are publishing so much, it must be trivial. I think that this is not true: any scientific community with sane people would protect itself against that, because we have to read what is published. The argument not to permit the accumulation of trivial, unimportant things which are not really new, which do not add to what was known before, is overwhelming.

    From paragraph 16 of J. Robert Oppenheimer, "On Science and Culture."

    Contraries

    At first sight the topic of contraries may seem very much like the topic of difference. But there is a subtle difference between the two topics. Difference involves unlike or dissimilar things, things which differ in kind; contraries on the other hand, involve opposite or incompatible things of the same kind. Differences become apparent when we compare things: contraries become apparent when we relate things. Liberty and license would be an example of difference; liberty and slavery would be an example of contraries.

    THE COMMON TOPICS II7

    Before discussing the rhetorical uses of the topic of contraries, we will briefly consider some of the logical principles governing contraries. Contrary terms are terms opposed to one another in the same order or genus. Cold and loud are different terms, but they are not contrary terms, because cold concerns the order of temperature, and loud the order of sound. Cold and hot, and loud and quiet, would be contrary terms. So if one person said, "This book is red" and the other person said, "This book is green," we would say that the propositions are opposed as contraries.

    These are the things we know about contrary propositions a priori—that is, before examination or analysis: (1) If one of the propositions is true, the other one is false; in other words, contrary propositions are incompatible; (2) If one of the propositions is false, the other one is not necessarily true; in other words, both of the propositions could be false. (See the "Square of Opposition" in the section on logic.)

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Contrary Propositions**\n\nConsider the statements: ''This book is red'' and ''This book is green.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify these statements as contrary propositions based on the definition provided in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Apply the two a priori properties of contrary propositions: (1) If one is true, the other is false; and (2) If one is false, the other is not necessarily true.\n- **Step 3**: Create a truth table to illustrate all possible combinations of truth values for these two propositions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the logical distinction between difference and contraries, as well as the a priori properties of contrary propositions.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Contraries**\n\nExplain why the terms ''cold'' and ''loud'' are not considered contraries, while ''cold'' and ''hot'' are, based on the text''s description.\n- **Step 1**: Reference the text''s explanation that contraries are terms of the same kind.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how ''cold'' and ''loud'' relate to different orders (temperature vs. sound).\n- **Step 3**: Compare ''cold'' and ''hot'' to ''loud'' and ''quiet'' in terms of being opposites within the same category.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between terms of different orders and those of the same order, as defined in the text.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Contrary Propositions to Rhetoric**\n\nUsing the text''s discussion on rhetorical uses of contraries, construct an argument where two contrary propositions are used to create a persuasive effect.\n- **Step 1**: Choose two contrary propositions (e.g., ''This policy is beneficial'' vs. ''This policy is harmful'').\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the use of these contraries highlights a binary choice in the argument.\n- **Step 3**: Reference the ''Square of Opposition'' from the text to justify why these propositions cannot both be true.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the rhetorical strategy of using contraries and demonstrate an understanding of their logical implications.'

    In an argument, then, if it has been agreed upon that contrary assertions have been made about the same subject, one can discredit the other assertion by proving that his assertion is true; in that case, one doesn't have to prove that the other assertion is false (if I prove that the book is red, I don't have to prove that the book is not green). On the other hand, if one proves that his opponent's proposition is false, his own proposition is not automatically true; one must go on to prove that his own proposition is true. (If I prove that the book is not green, I cannot assume that the book is red; after all, the book might be blue.)

    In rhetoric, arguments involving contraries or opposites sometimes take a form in which the subject terms and the predicate terms are both contrary. In Book II, Chapter 23, of the Rhetoric, Aristotle gives an example of an argument based on the topic of contraries: "Self-control is beneficial because licentiousness is harmful." Here the subject terms self-control and licentiousness are contraries; and the predicate terms beneficial and harmful are contraries too. We establish the truth of the first proposition ("Self-control is beneficial") by showing that the opposite of beneficial (namely, harmful) can be predicated of the opposite of self-control (namely, licentiousness). It someone were to argue, "If war is the cause of our misery, peace is the way to promote our happiness," he would be advancing the same kind of argument, for he would in effect be saying, "Peace must be a good because war is an evil."

    In the following excerpt, Henry David Thoreau argues from contraries—diligence (exertion) versus sloth (sluggishness), purity (chastity) versus impurity (sensuality), and wisdom versus ignorance—contending that where is sloth makes a man ignorant and impure, diligence will make him wise and pure:

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Contrary Arguments in Rhetoric**\n\nUsing the definitions and examples from the text, construct an argument in the form of a contrary relationship. Your argument should include:\n- **Part A**: Two contraries for the subject (e.g., ''diligence'' and ''sloth'')\n- **Part B**: Two contraries for the predicate (e.g., ''wise'' and ''ignorant'')\n- **Part C**: A logical connection between the subject contraries and predicate contraries based on the text''s explanation of how contrary arguments work\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must demonstrate understanding of the text''s explanation that proving the opposite of the predicate (e.g., ''ignorant'') for the opposite of the subject (e.g., ''sloth'') establishes the truth of the original proposition (e.g., ''diligence makes a man wise'').'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Contrary Argument Structure**\n\nGiven the example from the text: ''Self-control is beneficial because licentiousness is harmful,'' construct a similar argument about a different topic. Your argument must:\n- **Part A**: Identify two contraries for the subject (e.g., ''self-control'' and ''licentiousness'')\n- **Part B**: Identify two contraries for the predicate (e.g., ''beneficial'' and ''harmful'')\n- **Part C**: Explain how your argument follows the text''s explanation that showing the opposite predicate applies to the opposite subject proves the original proposition\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be logically consistent with the text''s explanation of contrary arguments and reference specific examples from the text (e.g., the ''war'' and ''peace'' example).'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Contrary Argument Validity**\n\nEvaluate the validity of the following argument using the text''s explanation of contrary arguments: ''A just society is one that upholds equality because an unjust society denies equality.''\n- **Part A**: Identify the contraries in the subject and predicate of this argument\n- **Part B**: Explain how the text''s example with ''war'' and ''peace'' supports or challenges this argument\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterargument that could be used to disprove the original statement, using the text''s methodology of proving the opposite predicate applies to the opposite subject\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must demonstrate an understanding of how contrary arguments work and apply the text''s principles to evaluate the validity of the given statement.'

It  \nis the same whether a man eat, or drink, or cohabit, or sleep sensually.  \nThey are but one appetite, and we only need to see a person do any one  \nof these things to know how great a sensualist he is. The impure can  \nneither stand nor sit with purity. When the reptile is attacked at one  \nmouth of his burrow, he shows himself at another. If you would be  \nchaste, you must be temperate. What is chastity? How shall a man know  \nif he is chaste? He shall not know it. We have heard of this virtue, but  \nwe know not what it is. We speak conformably to the rumor which we  \nhave heard. From exertion come wisdom and purity; from sloth, igno-  \nration and sensuality. In the student, sensuality is a sluggish habit of  \nmind.

J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sensual and Chaste Living**\n\nUsing the passage from ''Higher Laws'' by Thoreau, construct an argument about the relationship between sensuality and chastity.\n- **Step 1**: Define ''chastity'' based on the text''s description of it as an unknown virtue.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast sensuality with chastity using the text''s examples (e.g., the impure person, the student''s sluggish habit).\n- **Step 3**: Propose a solution to achieving chastity, referencing Thoreau''s advice on temperance and work.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must integrate at least three key themes from the text and demonstrate logical reasoning about the moral implications of these concepts.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Contradictory Propositions**\n\nExplain the logical relationship between contradictory propositions using the examples provided in the text.\n- **Part A**: Compare ''the water is hot'' and ''the water is not hot'' as contradictory propositions.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the example of A and O propositions (''all fathers are members...'') and E and I propositions (''no fathers are members...'').\n- **Part C**: Justify why ''a thing cannot at the same time and in the same respect be and not be'' is the foundation of contradiction.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must clearly define contradictory propositions and apply them to both the water example and the father examples, using logical reasoning based on the text''s description of contradiction.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Ethical Reasoning on Purity and Sloth**\n\nUsing the text, argue whether purity can be achieved through temperance and work.\n- **Step 1**: Define purity based on the text''s description of it as opposed to sensuality and sloth.\n- **Step 2**: Use the metaphor of the reptile to explain how impurity manifests.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a method for achieving purity, referencing Thoreau''s advice on working earnestly.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must incorporate the text''s metaphors and ethical principles, showing how purity is linked to moral action and self-discipline.'

    As in the case of contraries, there are some things we know a priori about contradictory propositions: (1) one of the propositions must be true, and the other must be false; (2) if one of the propositions is true, the other is false; (3) if one of the propositions is false, the other is true. So if one group of medical men says that cigarette-smoking causes lung cancer and another group says that it does not cause lung cancer, we know, before we ever investigate the facts, that one of these groups is right and the other is wrong. As we know from the heated controversy about this question in the press, it has been difficult for either group to prove conclusively that its claim is the correct one. But still we know that one of these groups has to be right, and someday scientists and doctors may be able to prove beyond doubt which group is right. Until such time, people will be guided in their decision about whether to smoke or not by the group which presents the most persuasive or probable arguments.

    THE COMMON TOPICS IIg

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding Contradictory Propositions**\n\nGiven the definition of contradictory propositions from the text, determine whether the following statements are contradictory:\n- "Smoking causes lung cancer" and "Smoking does not cause lung cancer"\n- "The Earth is flat" and "The Earth is round"\n\n**Task**: For each pair, apply the three a priori principles of contradiction provided in the text.\n1. One of the propositions must be true, and the other must be false.\n2. If one is true, the other is false.\n3. If one is false, the other is true.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Clearly state whether each pair is contradictory, and justify your answer using the principles from the text.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Principles**\n\nUsing the text''s discussion on how persuasive arguments guide decision-making, analyze the following scenario: A medical study claims that smoking increases the risk of lung cancer, while another study claims it does not.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the text''s argument about contradictory propositions applies to this situation.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the text''s mention of "persuasive or probable arguments" would influence public opinion on smoking, even if both studies are inconclusive.\n- **Part C**: Construct an analogy from the text to illustrate how a persuasive argument can shift public opinion in a debate, even when the underlying facts are not fully settled.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s rhetorical concepts with real-world reasoning about argumentation and public policy.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Contradictions**\n\nThe text states that in contradictory propositions, one must be true and the other false. Consider the following statements:\n- "The moon is made of green cheese" and "The moon is not made of green cheese"\n- "Water boils at 100°C" and "Water does not boil at 100°C"\n- "The square root of 2 is rational" and "The square root of 2 is irrational"\n\n**Task**: For each pair, determine if they are contradictory according to the text''s definition. If not, explain why.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reflect a clear understanding of the philosophical distinction between contradictory propositions and other types of logical relationships.\n'

- prompt: "In preparing arguments, either for confirmation or for refutation, we will  \nrecognize contradictions as a helpful topic whenever we see two propositions  \nrelated in such a way that the truth of one entails the falsity of the other.  \nSo we might begin a section of our discourse in this fashion: \"Some people  \nmaintain that the Constitution guarantees the right of every citizen to vote;  \nothers maintain that the Constitution states no such right.\" From these two  \ncontradictory propositions, we could go on to argue for one or the other  \nclaim. Sometimes we will start out by setting up an either/or situation:  \n\"Either he is willing to take a loyalty oath, or he is not willing\"; \"One thing  \nwe know for certain is that this mysterious cousin of his in Australia is either  \na man or a woman.\" And if the alternatives in the disjunctive proposition  \nare indeed mutually exclusive, we know that if we can prove one of the alter-  \nnatives to be true we will have proved that the other is necessarily false.  \nSometimes the contradiction between two related statements is implicit rather  \nthan explicit, and in that case our line of argument will be to point up the  \ninconsistency or, as we say, \"the contradiction in terms.\" So we might launch  \na refutation in this fashion: \"My opponent claims that he is a fervent advo-  \ncate of democracy. But has he not made it abundantly clear that he would  \ndeny the vote to certain citizens solely on the basis of color?\" By showing  \nthat the two positions are incompatible, we would in effect be proving that  \nour opponent is not a fervent advocate of democracy.\n\nCIRCUMSTANCE\n\nThe Possible and the Impossible\n\nThe first sub-topic to be considered under the general head of circumstance  \nis the possible and the impossible. Often when we are seeking to persuade  \nothers to do something, we have to show them that the proposed course of  \naction is possible; likewise, when we are seeking to discourage others from  \ndoing something, we may want to show them that the proposed course of  \naction is impossible. Even when people recognize that a course of action is  \ndesirable, they will sometimes hesitate to embark on it because they doubt  \nthat it is feasible.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Contradictory Propositions in Rhetoric**\n\nConsider the following two statements: "The Constitution guarantees the right of every citizen to vote" and "The Constitution states no such right."\n- **Part A**: Explain why these two statements are contradictory based on the definitions provided in the text.\n- **Part B**: Using the example from the text, construct a similar pair of contradictory propositions related to a modern political issue (e.g., climate change policy).\n- **Part C**: Justify why the text emphasizes that in logical arguments, contradictions help us determine the truth of a proposition.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly define what makes two propositions contradictory and provide a real-world example that aligns with the text''s explanation of contradiction in rhetoric.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Possible and Impossible Arguments**\n\nImagine you are a public speaker advocating for a new policy. Your audience is concerned about the feasibility of your proposal.\n- **Part A**: Explain how you would use the concept of ''possible'' to argue that the policy is feasible.\n- **Part B**: Conversely, explain how you would use the concept of ''impossible'' to argue against the policy.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the text''s distinction between ''possible'' and ''impossible'' relates to the logical structure of persuasion in rhetoric.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how these concepts are used in persuasion and their implications for argument construction.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Contradictions and Disjunctives**\n\nThe text discusses both explicit contradictions (e.g., ''either he is willing or not'') and implicit contradictions (e.g., ''a fervent advocate of democracy denying the vote based on color'').\n- **Part A**: Identify a real-world scenario where an explicit contradiction is used in argumentation.\n- **Part B**: Create a hypothetical scenario where an implicit contradiction is used to refute a claim.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the text''s examples show that contradictions can be used both to prove a proposition and to disprove it.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s examples and show a clear understanding of how contradictions function in logical argumentation.'

- prompt: |-
    A common way to inspire an audience with confidence in the practicality of a proposed course of action is to cite examples of people who have accomplished a similar or identical thing. The examples will be persuasive in proportion to the similarity of the actions and the circumstances.

    One can also argue deductively about the possible. In his Rhetoric, Aristotle proposed some lines of arguments about the possible. He did not lay down another set of arguments for the impossible, but suggested at the end of the action on the possible, "As for the impossible, the speaker will obviously have his stock of arguments in the opposites of the foregoing." The student will recognize that in arguing the possible one frequently employs some of the other topics that we have already discussed. Here are some of the lines of argument that Aristotle poses:

    1. If one of a pair of contraries is possible, then the other is possible too.

    The assumption here is that any two contraries, from their nature as contraries, are possible. For instance, if a man can get well, he can fall sick. It should be pointed out, however, that in some cases the pair of contraries may not be equally possible. For instance, in some cases we may not be able to argue that if a man can fall sick, he can get well, because he may be suffering from an incurable disease. As always in rhetoric, one must seize on the arguments that are available for the particular case in question.

    2. If one of a pair of similar things is possible, the other thing is possible too.

    For instance, if it is possible for a man to play an organ, it is possible for him to play a piano. The fact that men have always argued for the possibility of one thing by pointing to the possibility of a similar instance suggests that the principle involved here is self-evident.

    3. If the more difficult of two things is possible, then the easier is possible too.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Contraries in Rhetorical Argumentation**\n\nAristotle''s discussion of contraries states that if one member of a pair is possible, the other must also be possible. Consider the following scenario: A city council debates whether to implement a new public transportation system.\n- **Part A**: Identify two contraries in this context and explain why they are considered contraries.\n- **Part B**: Apply Aristotle''s principle to argue that if the council can support the implementation of the system, they must also be able to oppose it.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the concept of contraries can be used to challenge a claim that the council is ''unwilling'' to consider alternative viewpoints.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference Aristotle''s definition of contraries and demonstrate an understanding of how they apply to real-world decision-making scenarios.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Implications of Similar Things in Rhetoric**\n\nAristotle''s principle on similar things states that if one is possible, the other must also be possible. Imagine a political campaign where a candidate argues that if they can win by focusing on economic issues, they can also win by emphasizing social policies.\n- **Part A**: Identify the two similar things in this context and explain why they are considered similar.\n- **Part B**: Apply Aristotle''s principle to argue that the candidate''s claim is logically consistent.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate how this principle could be misused in rhetoric, such as by falsely equating unrelated topics.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the distinction between similar and unrelated things, as well as the ethical implications of misusing this principle.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Deductive Reasoning on Difficulty and Possibility**\n\nAristotle''s third principle states that if the more difficult of two things is possible, then the easier is also possible. Consider a student who argues that if they can pass a difficult exam, they must be able to pass an easier one.\n- **Part A**: Identify the two things in this context and explain why they are considered difficult and easy.\n- **Part B**: Apply Aristotle''s principle to argue that the student''s reasoning is logically valid.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how this principle could be used to justify or challenge the feasibility of a complex project, such as building a bridge.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate Aristotle''s principle with real-world examples and demonstrate an understanding of how it applies to both academic and practical contexts.'

    For instance, a spokesman for the National Aeronautic and Space Administration may one day be arguing before Congress that if it is possible to rocket a single man to Mars, it is possible to rocket several men to the moon. The student may recognize here the operation of the a fortiori argument that we discussed in connection with the topic of degree.

    4. If something can have a beginning, it can have an end; and conversely, if something can have an end, it can have a beginning.

    The principle upon which this argument is based is that no impossibility comes, or begins to come, into existence. Aristotle's classic example of an impossibility—of something that cannot have a beginning and therefore cannot have an end—is squaring a circle. Aristotle is not suggesting that everything that has a beginning will necessarily be finished. What he is suggesting is that every beginning implies an end and that every end implies a beginning. The man who uses this topic to win acceptance for his proposal is

    THE COMMON TOPICS I2I

    arguing for the feasibility or facility of his plan rather than for its mere possibility. He argues, in effect, that "well begun is half done," that what has been begun can with faith, perseverance, and hard work be brought to fruition.

    5. If the parts of a thing are possible, then the whole is possible; and conversely, if the whole is possible, the parts are possible.

    One can imagine a group of space scientists using this line of argument to convince members of Congress that it is possible to put a man into orbit. By showing that all the component parts of a launching vehicle have been manufactured or can be manufactured, they could argue that a rocket capable of putting a man into space could, if adequate appropriations were made by Congress, be constructed. The writers of the Federalist papers used an argument like this when they proposed that a confederation of states was possible because the components of such a confederation already existed. The persuasiveness of an argument in the other direction—from whole to part—is self-evident. If a functioning unit exists, then all the parts necessary for that functioning unit must exist.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of A Fortiori and Beginning-End Arguments**\n\nUsing the text provided, explain how an argument about launching a rocket to Mars can be structured using both the **a fortiori** argument and the **beginning-end** principle.\n- **Part A**: Describe the a fortiori argument by comparing launching one man to Mars with launching multiple men to the moon. Reference Aristotle''s example of squaring a circle as an impossibility that cannot have a beginning or end.\n- **Part B**: Construct a beginning-end argument to support the feasibility of a Mars mission, citing how the ability to start a project implies its eventual completion.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the two arguments, explaining how they both rely on logical inferences about possibility and feasibility without claiming absolute certainty.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the definitions and examples from the text to demonstrate a clear understanding of both argumentative techniques.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of the ''Parts to Whole'' Argument**\n\nUsing the text, explain how the ''parts to whole'' argument applies to both space exploration and political theory.\n- **Part A**: Describe how the Federalist Papers used this argument to justify a confederation of states.\n- **Part B**: Create a hypothetical scenario in which space scientists use the ''parts to whole'' argument to convince Congress of a Mars mission.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the reverse of this argument (from whole to part) might be used in a political context.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reference specific examples from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how this argument is used in both scientific and political discourse.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Impossibility and Possibility**\n\nUsing the text, analyze the distinction between impossibility (e.g., squaring a circle) and possibility (e.g., launching a rocket to Mars).\n- **Part A**: Explain why squaring a circle is considered an impossibility, referencing Aristotle''s principle that impossibilities cannot have a beginning or end.\n- **Part B**: Argue that launching a rocket to Mars is a possibility, using the beginning-end principle to show how starting a project implies its eventual completion.\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument that challenges the claim: "If something is impossible, then it cannot have a beginning." Use logical reasoning based on the text''s discussion of impossibility and possibility.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s definitions and examples to demonstrate a clear understanding of the logical distinctions between impossibility and possibility.'

- prompt: "6. If a thing can be produced without art or preparation, it certainly  \ncan be done with the help of art or planning.\n\nThis is a kind of a fortiori argument, but it differs slightly from the line of  \nargument suggested in (3) above. Principle (3) is concerned with an argu-  \nment about whether a thing can be done at all; (6) is concerned with whether  \na thing can be done well.\n\nIn paragraph 24 of his essay \"Literature and Science,\" Matthew Arnold asks,  \n\"Have humane letters, then, have poetry and eloquence, the power here  \nattributed to them of engaging the emotions?\" To substantiate his claim that  \nthe humanities can engage the emotions, he refers to the common experience  \nof men. \"The appeal,\" Arnold says, \"is to experience. Experience shows that  \nfor the vast majority of men, for mankind in general, they have the power.\" The assumption behind all appeals to experience or historical example is that  \nif something has been done, it can be done again.\n\nOne of the advantages that James Madison attaches to a confederation of  \nstates is that there is less chance of unworthy men seizing control of the gov-  \nernment. He does not say that it is impossible for unworthy men to seize  \npower in a confederation of states, but he does say that it is more difficult  \nfor such men to seize power. He puts it this way in paragraph 18 of The  \nFederalist, No. 10:\n\nI22 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS\n\nIn the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater  \nnumber of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will be more  \ndifficult for unworthy candidates to practise with success the vicious arts  \nby which elections are too often carried; and the suffrages of the people  \nbeing more free, will be more likely to center in men who possess the  \nmost attractive merit and the most diffusive and established characters.\n\nThe student will discover many other examples of arguments from the pos-  \nsible and impossible in the readings reproduced in this book.\n\nPast Fact and Future Fact\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Fortiori Argument and Historical Appeal**\n\nCompare and contrast the two arguments presented in the text: (3) and (6), which discuss whether a thing can be done at all versus whether it can be done well. Use the example from Matthew Arnold''s "Literature and Science" to illustrate how appeals to experience or historical examples function within the framework of a fortiori reasoning.\n- **Step 1**: Define the difference between (3) and (6) using the text''s explanation of a fortiori arguments.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how Arnold''s argument about literature and emotion uses historical experience to support his claim.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the text emphasizes that ''if something has been done, it can be done again'' as a foundational assumption for historical appeals.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both a fortiori argument structures and the role of historical experience in rhetorical reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Confederation and Governance**\n\nJames Madison''s argument in The Federalist, No. 10 about confederations and the difficulty of unworthy men seizing power relies on logical reasoning about the size of republics. Construct an argument that applies this reasoning to a modern political system, such as a federal government or a parliamentary democracy.\n- **Step 1**: Summarize Madison''s core claim about confederations and the role of representation.\n- **Step 2**: Use Madison''s reasoning to argue why a large, federal system is more resistant to tyranny of the majority.\n- **Step 3**: Compare and contrast this reasoning with a different political system (e.g., direct democracy) in terms of its vulnerability to unworthy leaders.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must integrate Madison''s reasoning with modern political structures and demonstrate an understanding of the balance between representation and control.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Possibility and Impossibility**\n\nThe text distinguishes between arguments about the possible and impossible. Using the examples from the readings, construct a counterargument to the claim: ''If something has been done before, it is possible to do it again.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the assumption underlying this claim based on the text''s explanation of historical appeals.\n- **Step 2**: Provide a counterexample that shows this assumption is not always valid.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the text''s emphasis on ''past fact'' versus ''future fact'' challenges the idea that historical success guarantees future possibility.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the distinction between past and future facts, and show how logical reasoning can challenge the assumption that historical experience is a guarantee of repeatability.'

- prompt: |-
    The topic of past fact is concerned with whether something has or has not happened. In ancient rhetoric it played an important part in forensic oratory, since for the definition of the issue in a court trial it was important to determine whether an act had been done or not. Future fact—or, more accurately, future probability—was concerned with whether or not something would happen; this topic was used most often in deliberative oratory.

    Wherever evidence or testimony is available to prove that something has happened, it should of course be presented to substantiate the claims that have been made about past events. But frequently in human affairs it is not easy, sometimes impossible, to discover the evidence or testimony that could confirm the occurrence of an event. In such cases, one must resort to arguing the probability of something having occurred. As we have said repeatedly, the probable is the main province in which the rhetorician operates; after all, there can be no room for argument about what is certain.

    Where past fact cannot be established empirically, deductive reasoning takes over and, arguing from probable premises, draws more or less probable conclusions. Here are some lines of arguments that one can use to persuade others about a past fact:

    1. If the less probable of two events has occurred, the more probable event is likely to have occurred too.

    Here is the a fortiori argument again. Statisticians, among others, make use of this line of argument to establish the probability of past occurrences. If a number of triplets have been born, then a proportionate number of twins have been born too. Imagine a prosecuting lawyer using this line of argument to persuade a jury about the guilt of the defendant: "If, as has been admitted, this man has been guilty of stealing money from his father, do you find it too far-fetched to believe that he was capable of embezzling money from his employer?" The degree of probability would increase of course with the frequency of occurrence.

    2. If something that naturally follows something else has occurred, then that something else has happened too; and conversely, if the antecedents were present, then the natural consequences occurred too.

    Men instinctively reason this way. If we hear thunder, we presume that lightning has flashed, even though we may never have seen the flash of lightning. Or if lightning flashed, then thunder followed. If a man has forgotten something, we presume that he once knew it. If a man has a fever, we suppose that he has been seized by some illness. If a man shows up with a black eye and a swollen lip, the natural supposition is that he has been in a fight or walked into a door.

    3. If someone had the power and the desire and the opportunity to do something, then he has done it.

    The principle supporting the probability here is that men will gratify their desires when they have the chance, either through lack of self-control or through a natural appetite for what they perceive as a good. Prosecuting lawyers have employed this line of argument in trying to convince a jury that the defendant was guilty. Such arguments of course can legally establish nothing more than a strong suspicion of guilt, but combined with other incriminating evidence, they do have great persuasive power.

    Arguments against the probability of something having occurred can be found in the opposites of the foregoing lines of argument.

    One must more often rely on probable arguments to establish future fact than to establish past fact, because where something has occurred there is always the chance of discovering the proof that it has indeed occurred; but there is always a note of uncertainty about future events. Here are some suggestive lines of argument for persuading others about the likelihood of a future event:

    1. If the power and the desire to do something are present, then that something will be done.

    One of the strong arguments that have been advanced in support of nuclear disarmament is that the mere possession of atomic weapons poses a constant threat to a nation to use them against an enemy. Some pacifists go so far as to argue that the use of the nuclear bomb is not only probable but inevitable.

    2. If the antecedents of something are present, then the natural consequences will occur.

    "If dark clouds have gathered, it is going to rain." (Even the weatherman will admit that this event is just a probability.) "If a raging mob has gathered"

    occur so regularly, that high probability verges on virtual certainty. When a
    tightly closed room is filled with gas fumes, it is virtually certain that if some-
    one strikes a match in that room an explosion will occur.

    The odds-makers at Las Vegas are certainly going to pick as the winner of
    the World Series the baseball team that appears to be stronger on paper. But
    as everyone knows, the team with the "best means" does not always win the
    World Series. This line of argument is a familiar one in political debate.
    Now that the legal machinery has been set up to protect civil rights, it ap-
    pears likely that some time in the near future everyone in the United States
    will enjoy the rights and privileges of first-class citizenship.

    The main burden of the argument in the editorial about the Sacco-Vanzetti
    trial printed at the end of this chapter is that the execution of the defendants
    should be stayed because grave doubts exist about the evidence presented in
    the trial to establish a past fact. In paragraph 3 of the editorial, the writer
    cites those doubts to establish a future probability too:

    These elemental conditions have not been fulfilled, we submit, in the
    cases of Sacco and Vanzetti. There remains in the minds of uncounted
    multitudes the gravest doubt as to whether they have had an absolutely
    unprejudiced trial on all the available evidence....There can be no
    question, therefore, that if Sacco and Vanzetti die on Monday night mul-
    titudes will regard their death not as a just penalty for a brutal crime but
    as a martyrdom.

    A third point: if one looks to the future of something that doubles every ten years, there must come a time when it stops, just as The Physical Review cannot weigh more than the earth. We know that this will saturate, and probably at a level very much higher than today; there will come a time when the rate of growth of science is not such that in every ten years the amount that is known is doubled; but the amount that is added to knowledge then will be far greater than it is today.

    TESTIMONY

    Under the general head of testimony, we shall consider six sub-topics—authorities, testimonial, statistics, maxims, law, precedent. Unlike the other topics, which derive their material from the nature of the question under discussion,
    testimony derives its material from external sources. In the next section of this chapter, entitled "External Aids to Invention," the student will be advised about some of the standard reference works that can provide additional supporting material for exposition or argumentation.

    Authority

    The first sub-topic to be considered under the topic of testimony is authority.
    It is probably true that informed opinion or authority carries less weight
    today than it once did. In an age characterized by a scientific attitude and a
    democratic spirit, men are temperamentally not as disposed as they once
    were to be impressed and swayed by the voice of authority and the pro-
    nouncements of men "in the know." In situations where facts are recoverable
    —and modern technology has greatly extended the realm of the empirical—
    men prefer facts to opinions. They are not as ready to accept something as
    true merely because someone says it is true. For them, it is "facts" which carry
    the persuasive force.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Testimony and Scientific Reasoning**\n\nGiven the text''s discussion on authority in rhetoric and its contrast with modern scientific attitudes, construct an argument that addresses the following claims:\n1. Authority in rhetoric is often contrasted with empirical evidence.\n2. Modern science values objective facts over subjective opinions.\n3. The text suggests that the role of authority in persuasion has diminished due to technological advancements.\n\n**Task**:\n- Use the text''s definitions of authority and testimony to formulate a logical argument that reconciles the role of authority with empirical evidence in contemporary discourse.\n- Reference the quote: ''men are temperamentally not as disposed as they once were to be impressed and swayed by the voice of authority.''\n- Conclude with a statement on how this shift impacts the validity of historical and scientific arguments.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be structured with clear premises, logical connections, and explicit references to the text''s content.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Testimony in Argumentation**\n\nUsing the text''s framework of testimony (authorities, testimonial, statistics, maxims, law, precedent), design a rhetorical argument for the following topic: ''The importance of technological advancement in modern education.''\n\n**Task**:\n- Identify at least three sub-topics from the testimony framework and explain how they support your argument.\n- Use the text''s mention of ''external aids to invention'' (e.g., reference works) as a basis for one of your sub-topics.\n- Incorporate the idea that ''testimony derives its material from external sources'' into your reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must integrate the text''s concepts and demonstrate a clear application of rhetorical testimony in contemporary education.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Analysis of Rhetorical Testimony and Scientific Progress**\n\nThe text discusses the future of science, noting that ''there will come a time when the rate of growth of science is not such that in every ten years the amount that is known is doubled.'' Considering the text''s discussion of authority and testimony, answer the following:\n1. How does the diminishing role of authority in science relate to the saturation of scientific knowledge?\n2. What implications does this have for the use of testimony in future scientific discourse?\n3. Construct an analogy using the text''s example of ''The Physical Review cannot weigh more than the earth'' to explain the concept of scientific saturation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must connect the text''s themes of authority, testimony, and scientific progress with logical reasoning and creative analogies based on the provided material.'

    Although modern man is not as disposed to accept authority as his grandfather was, he is frequently forced by circumstances to rely on authority. Informed opinion does indeed still play a prominent part in the conduct of human affairs. For one thing, knowledge is so diversified and specialized in our age that no man can claim, as Francis Bacon once did, to take all knowledge for his province, and since the day-to-day affairs of a society cannot wait for all its citizens to catch up with the latest discoveries, men are obliged to take the "word" of some expert about the facts. For another thing, since men dispute mainly about uncertain, unpredictable matters, they frequently must turn to informed opinion to guide them in settling issues or making decisions.

    Although informed opinion is not infallible, it has great persuasive force. We tend to grant more credence to the testimony of experts than to the testimony of amateurs; we place more faith in the opinions of those who pronounce on matters connected with their field of knowledge than in the opinions of those speaking outside their field of competence. A Congressional committee investigating the potential danger from nuclear fall-out will pay more attention to the renowned physicist than to the ordinary citizen, however interested and well-read the citizen may be. There have been instances, of course, where the expert turned out to be wrong and the amateur to be right, but there is always greater probability that the expert will be right.

    Sometimes experts offer conflicting opinions. In evaluating conflicting testimony from equally competent experts, we must rely on other criteria in deciding which opinion to accept. In such cases, we ask questions like these:

    1. Is there anything inconsistent, contradictory, or illogical in the expression of the opinion itself?

    2. Do the experts harbor any prejudices that might influence or color the proffered opinion?

    3. Do any of the experts have an axe to grind? an advantage to gain? a score to settle?

    4. Is one expert's opinion based on more recent, more reliable information than the other's is?

    5. Is one expert's opinion accepted by more experts? by the more authoritative experts?

    6. What are the basic assumptions behind the expressions of opinion? Are any of these assumptions vulnerable? Does the exposure of these assumptions reveal that the conflict between the experts is more apparent than real because they are viewing the same matter from different points of view?

    Answers to probing questions like these will determine which of the conflicting opinions will have the greater persuasive force for a particular occasion and a particular audience.

    Testimonial

    Similar to the topic of authority is the strategy of the testimonial, which takes many forms: the letter of recommendation, the advertising "puff," the "blurb," the character-witness appraisal, the opinion-poll, the best-seller list, the audience-rating. All of these represent attempts to influence opinion, action, or acceptance. The testimonial does not have to come from an impartial, expert source to be persuasive. Sometimes the persuasive force of a testimonial stems from the esteem we have for the person or the achievements of the one offering the recommendation. "Roger Ruth smokes Olympic cigarettes." An advertising slogan like that could influence thousands of people to buy Olympic cigarettes because Roger Ruth is a renowned athlete. What a slogan like this attempts to do is to transfer the esteem we have for the person to the product he recommends. In rhetorical terminology, the testimonial has "ethical appeal"—the kind of appeal that Aristotle says is often more effective in persuading an audience than appeals to reason or appeals to emotions. People tend to forget that Roger Ruth's skill as a ballplayer does not especially qualify him to be a good judge of cigarettes; that Roger Ruth is being paid to give his recommendation; that Roger Ruth's testimonial does not necessarily prove anything about the quality of Olympic cigarettes.
    Two general observations can be made: (1) the testimonial can be remarkably persuasive in certain circumstances and with certain audiences; (2) the testimonial is remarkably vulnerable to refutation. Not every testimonial, of course, is to be discounted as dishonest, insincere, or irrelevant. The important caution is that the testimonial must not be used or accepted uncritically.

    Similar to the testimonial is the citation of statistics. "Five million people last year bought Humbug Products." "Fifty-eight per cent of the new homes built last year were equipped with Leakproof Appliances." Sometimes this strategy is referred to as the "bandwagon technique." Everybody's doing it, so it must be good. Now, there is no denying that the preference for one product over another could be an indication that the preferred product is superior in quality to the other products. Most people have faith that superior quality, all other things being equal, will in the long run win out over the second-rate and the meretricious. So statistics can be a useful and an effective topic in many discussions.

    What we must guard against in the use of statistics is making unwarranted inferences. Statistics, if accurate and if legitimately gathered, confirm a fact; but they do not always support an inference made from that fact. 'The fact that a book has been at the top of the best-seller list for twelve months or more supports the fact that many people have bought this book. That fact, however, will not necessarily justify the further assertion, "This best-selling novel is the best novel published last year" or "You too will thrill to the drama of this runaway best-seller."

    In the previous paragraphs we have been considering comparative statistics — pairs or groups of figures and percentages which help to decide questions of more and less. But statistics can be used in argument for purposes other than deciding superiority. Statistics can be used, for instance, to settle con- trary and contradictory assertions. Suppose that one party in a dispute maintains, "Most Americans own their homes," and that the other party maintains, "Most Americans do not own their homes." If the two disputants agree upon the meaning of own, these two statements are directly contradictory. As we saw in the discussion of the topic of contradiction, one of these statements is true, and the other is false. An obvious way to determine which assertion is true is to cite statistics: "The 1960 Census reveals that (number) Americans or ______ per cent of citizens over twenty-one years of age have completely paid off the mortgage on the house in which they dwell."

'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluation of Contradictory Statistics**\n\nSuppose two parties in a dispute claim that ''Most Americans own their homes'' and ''Most Americans do not own their homes.'' Using the text''s discussion of contradictory assertions, explain how statistics can resolve this contradiction.\n- **Step 1**: Explain why the two statements are contradictory based on the definition of ''own'' provided in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Describe how citing a specific statistic (e.g., the 1960 Census) can determine which statement is true.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the text emphasizes that statistics confirm a fact, but do not always support an inference.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate understanding of the text''s argument about statistics resolving direct contradictions and the limitations of statistical inference.

    Statistics can be used to support or discredit all kinds of assertions. The chief caution to be observed in regard to the use of this topic is that one should not accept statistics uncritically. Statistics are always liable to the challenge of questions like these:

    1. What is the source of these statistics?

    2. Is this a qualified, unbiased source?

    3. How were these figures arrived at?

    4. Was the sampling a reliably representative survey?

    5. When were these figures gathered?
    6. Are these figures contradicted or superseded by figures from
    other sources?

    Polls and surveys are playing an increasingly prominent role in modern
    life. The better polling agencies, by devising scientific formulas for ex-
    trapolating sample findings, have achieved an amazing record of accuracy.
    Electronic computing machines too have increased the reliability of the in-
    terpretations and predictions made from statistics. We should be aware, how-
    ever, that polling techniques, especially those that depend for their findings
    on personal interviews with people, have certain built-in limitations. The
    wording of a question put to the man in the street influences his response.
    Any time a question-begging word gets into a question the response will be
    biased. The responses to a question like "Do you favor the abolition of exces-
    sive taxes?" cannot be interpreted to mean that most people favor the aboli-
    tion of taxes. Sometimes the juxtaposition of questions can bias the responses.
    If the question "Should subversive organizations be outlawed in America?"
    were followed by the question "Should the Communist Party be outlawed
    in America?" the response to the second question would undoubtedly be
    prejudiced by the response to the first question.

    Another weakness inherent in the personal interview stems from two as-
    sumptions that pollsters make: (1) that people always know their own mind
    on questions put to them; (2) that people will give truthful answers to ques-
    tions put to them. Does the man in the street always know, at any given
    stage in a presidential campaign, which candidate he favors? If he is unde-
    cided or confused, he will sometimes give an answer, any answer, because he
    is ashamed to admit to the pollster that he does not really know which can-
    didate he favors at the moment. When the question concerns a matter that
    is more complex, the likelihood increases that the interviewee does not know
    his own mind. Pollsters make provision for this uncertain state of mind by
    permitting the interviewee to answer "Undecided," but sometimes a person
    is undecided even about whether he is undecided. As for the other assump-
    tion, for one reason or another, some people deliberately mislead the ques-
    tioner, by not giving a truthful answer. Recognizing this fact, pollsters in-
    clude a discount-factor in their formulas for extrapolating the information
    they have gathered.

    All of the above observations about the cogency and weaknesses of statistics
    suggest the ways in which we can use statistics to support our own arguments
    or to refute the arguments advanced by the opposition. Employed discreetly,
    statistics can be a valuable topic in expository and argumentative writing.

    THE COMMON TOPICS 129

    Maxims

    We shall use the term maxims (Greek, gnomat; Latin, sententiae) to cover
    precepts, proverbs, famous sayings, epigrammatic pronouncements, self-evi-
    dent truths, sententious generalizations—all kinds of charismatic statements
    that people introduce into an argument. In the Rhetoric, Book II, Chapter
    21, Aristotle treated maxims as a prelude to his discussion of the enthymeme,
    because, as he observed, maxims often constitute one of the premises of a
    syllogistic argument. For instance, in an argument about financial matters,
    one can imagine a disputant saying, "A fool and his money are soon parted."
    The full argument suggested by this proverb would run something like this:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Polling Biases in Statistical Surveys**\n\nExplain how the two assumptions made by pollsters impact the accuracy of survey results. Use examples from the text to illustrate how these assumptions can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n- **Part A**: Discuss the first assumption about people knowing their own minds. Provide a scenario where this assumption might fail and explain why it undermines the validity of the survey.\n- **Part B**: Address the second assumption about truthful answers. Describe a situation where deliberate deception could alter the survey''s findings and propose a method pollsters use to account for such errors.\n- **Part C**: Synthesize your findings into a general statement about the limitations of self-reported data in polling.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reference specific examples from the text and demonstrate an understanding of both assumptions'' roles in survey accuracy.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Applying Maxims to Construct a Logical Argument**\n\nUsing the definition of maxims provided in the text, construct an argument based on a well-known proverb.\n- **Part A**: Choose a maxim that is commonly used in everyday speech (e.g., "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step").\n- **Part B**: Formulate a syllogistic argument using the maxim as a premise. Include at least one specific conclusion drawn from the maxim.\n- **Part C**: Explain how this argument aligns with Aristotle''s view of maxims as premises in syllogistic reasoning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be logically sound, and you must explicitly connect it to the text''s definition of maxims.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Evaluating the Role of Statistics in Argumentation**\n\nDiscuss how statistics can be used to support or refute arguments, using the text''s explanation of statistical cogency and weaknesses.\n- **Part A**: Provide an example from the text where statistics are used to support a claim. Explain how the statistical reasoning supports that claim.\n- **Part B**: Describe a scenario where statistics might be misused to refute an argument. Highlight the logical fallacy involved in such misuse.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the text''s advice about using statistics discreetly in writing. Offer a practical example of how a writer might employ statistics without overreaching their credibility.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of statistical integrity and demonstrate a clear understanding of appropriate and inappropriate use of statistics.'

    A fool and his money are soon parted.
    John Smith is undeniably a fool when it comes to money matters.
    John Smith is sure to lose out on his investment.

    Maxims are statements, not about particular matters, but about universal
    matters. So the statement "Yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look" would
    not be a maxim, but it would take on the air of a maxim if it were changed
    to "One should be wary of lean and hungry men." It is not all general state-
    ments, however, that can be considered maxims. "A straight line is the short-
    est distance between two points" would not be one. Maxims are general
    statements about human actions, about things that are to be chosen or avoided
    in human action.

    The value of maxims, according to Aristotle, is that they invest a discourse
    with "moral character," with that ethical appeal so important in persuading
    others. Because maxims touch upon universal truths about life, they win
    ready assent from the audience, and because of their air of hoary wisdom,
    they are endowed with a peculiar sanctity. Because maxims strike this note
    of ancient, sanctified wisdom, they are more appropriate, as Aristotle ob-
    served, when they come from the lips of older, experienced men. A maxim
    is just as true when uttered by a young man as when uttered by an older
    man, but, in certain circumstances, a maxim issuing from a callow youth
    will sound pretentious, even ridiculous. Alexander Pope was fortunate that
    many of his readers did not know that the author of the collection of wise
    and witty precepts in The Essay on Criticism was barely twenty-one years
    of age.

    Maxims should not be avoided merely because they are well known. Their
    very familiarity may be an asset. The familiar often seems self-evident and
    for that reason wins an uncritical acceptance. Herein lies a danger however.
    The familiar quotation, the slogan, the platitude, the bromide have a way
    of acquiring immunity from criticism. For this reason, we often resort to the
    sanctified truism when we are seeking acceptance for our cause. Instead of

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Maxim Characteristics**\n\nIdentify and classify the following statements as either maxims or non-maxims based on the text''s definition of a maxim:\n1. "A straight line is the shortest distance between two points"\n2. "One should always tell the truth."\n3. "The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page."\n4. "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."\n\n**Task**: For each statement, provide a clear justification using the criteria from the text (e.g., whether it''s a general statement about human actions, its universality, and if it''s attributed to a person or not).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your classification must align with the text''s explanation of maxims and their characteristics.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Evaluation of Maxim Use**\n\nDiscuss the implications of using a maxim in a persuasive argument, referencing the text''s explanation of how maxims function in rhetoric.\n- **Part A**: Explain why a maxim might be more persuasive than a specific argument.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the potential pitfalls of relying on familiar maxims, as discussed in the text.\n- **Part C**: Provide an example of a maxim that could be misused in a persuasive context, and explain how it would fail to meet the ethical standards outlined by Aristotle.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the text''s discussion on the ethical appeal of maxims and their potential for being perceived as pretentious when used by someone inexperienced.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Formation of a Maxim**\n\nCreate your own maxim that adheres to the criteria outlined in the text.\n- **Part A**: State your maxim clearly and concisely.\n- **Part B**: Justify why it qualifies as a maxim based on the text''s definition (e.g., universality, focus on human actions, and the absence of specific references).\n- **Part C**: Discuss a scenario in which this maxim could be appropriately used, and explain how its use would align with the text''s discussion of maxims in rhetoric.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your maxim must be original and meet the criteria for a valid maxim as described in the text.'

    earning assent, we bribe it. Besides running the danger of being unethical,
    such a practice can induce lazy habits. When the maxim upon which we are
    basing an argument is challenged, we may be unprepared to defend its truth.
    Sometimes too we wrongly concede an argument because we have not taken
    the trouble to question the apparently "truthful" premise.

    These reminders are not intended to discourage the use of the topic of
    maxims; they are intended merely to alert us to the dangers of uncritical ac-
    ceptance of "what oft was thought." The student should bear in mind Plato's
    salutary observation, "The unexamined life is not worth living."

    Law

    Under the topic law will be comprehended all statutes, contracts, testaments,
    records, and documents which can be drawn on to substantiate or refute a
    claim. Recorded evidence has a compelling force in any argument. An argu-
    ment about the date of a man's birth, for instance, can usually be settled sum-
    marily by a birth certificate or a baptismal record. Producing a bona fide will
    can silence rival claimants to a man's inheritance. When a critic adduces a state-
    ment from diaries or letters about an author's intention in a literary work,
    he does not necessarily clinch his interpretation, but he certainly strength-
    ens it.

    People have a great awe of the written or printed word. How often we have
    heard the statement, "But it says so, right here in the book." Respect for the
    recorded word is in many ways a good thing. We could hardly conduct the
    affairs of daily life if society did not maintain respect for what is recorded
    "in black and white." Without deeds and contracts, all property rights, for
    one thing, would be tenuous. A verbal contract between a car-owner and a
    dealer will not stand up in court; but a written warranty, duly signed by
    both parties, gives a judge something concrete and definite upon which to
    decide a litigation.

    What we must remember, however, is that documentary evidence does not
    necessarily foreclose all further debate; recorded words are open to challenge
    and to interpretation. We can protest, for instance, that a document produced
    in evidence is not an authentic document. Challenges like the following can
    also be brought forward to test the authenticity of a document:

Explain why a written will is more compelling than oral testimony.\n- **Part B**: Evaluate the strength of a critic''s interpretation of an author''s intention based on a diary entry. Reference the text''s discussion about how such evidence ''strengthens'' but does not ''clinch'' an interpretation.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the persuasiveness of a ''baptismal record'' versus a ''verbal contract'' in legal disputes. Use the text''s explanation of ''recorded evidence'' to justify your comparison.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s examples and their implications for legal reasoning.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nThe text discusses the balance between respecting recorded evidence and being open to challenge.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the phrase ''The unexamined life is not worth living'' relates to the use of documentary evidence in arguments. Use the text''s warning about ''uncritical acceptance'' to support your reasoning.\n- **Part B**: Construct a counterargument to the claim that ''all written records are infallible.'' Reference at least two challenges mentioned in the text to the authenticity of documents.\n- **Part C**: Analyze the role of ''recorded evidence'' in daily life, using examples from the text (e.g., property rights, contracts). Justify why society must maintain respect for written records even when they are open to interpretation.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reflect the text''s emphasis on critical thinking and the balance between respect for evidence and the need to question its validity.'

    4. In the process of transmission, the wording of the document was altered.

    5. Those authorities who could attest to the authenticity of the document are not available.
    6. Another or a later document invalidates this one.

    Then too the wording of documents is always open to interpretation. The Constitution of the United States, for instance, is the bona fide document upon which our government is based. But one of the chief functions of the Supreme Court is to interpret the already authenticated wording of the Constitution. In our own time, we have seen what heated disputes have developed over the doctrine of separation of church and state in Article 1 of the Bill of Rights ("Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof") and over the doctrine of states' rights in Article 10 of the Bill of Rights ("The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."). The meaning of statute laws too is constantly being argued in courts.

    Precedent

    The last of the sub-topics to be considered under testimony is precedent, which is most common in law trials conducted before a judge. Because judges are often guided by previous decisions, lawyers, in preparing briefs for a case, will search out decisions that other judges have made in similar cases. The task of the lawyer is to convince the judge that the case under consideration is similar to the previous case. In effect, the lawyer's argument runs something like this:

    Your honor, I have shown that the case under consideration has a precedent in the case of New York vs. John Smith, No. 2435, tried on October 29, 1919 before Judge Harry Snodgrass. In that case, Judge Snodgrass returned a judgment that the defendant did not have to pay taxes to the plaintiff on property that had been confiscated before the due date of the tax payments. The judge ruled that although John Smith continued to occupy the property for three months, he ceased to be the owner of the property on the date that he signed the confiscation papers, and he was no longer liable for taxes once he transferred ownership, even though he continued, per agreement, to occupy the property rent-free for three months. Since the circumstances of this case are similar to those in the New York case and since the tax laws in this state are similar to those that prevailed in New York at that time, I respectfully propose that a similar ruling be made in this case.

    The opposing lawyer, of course, will try to prove that the two cases are not similar or that an important difference has been overlooked or that an important consideration has been distorted. Or he will cite, if available, other

    precedents in which a quite different judgment was returned. When opposing precedents are presented, the lawyers will contend that one precedent should supersede the other. Each lawyer will try to show that his precedent is more relevant or more logical or more recent or more reliable (because it comes from a more reputable source) or more cogent (because there are more precedents of this kind than of the other kind).

    So far we have dealt only with the use of precedent in judicial rhetoric, but
    precedent can play a part too in arguments about other matters. When there
    is a dispute, for instance, about how to finance the building of a bridge, the
    parties in the dispute will cite examples of how other states voted to finance
    such a project and how successful the method proved to be. The inference
    to be drawn from the analogous cases is that such-and-such a method of
    financing will be equally successful or unsuccessful in the case under con-
    sideration. The use of precedents of this kind is very much like example,
    which Aristotle designated as the rhetorical form of induction. We can say,
    in general, that precedent is the strategy of bringing to bear on a present
    case what has been done in a similar case in the past.

    It happens that the topics we have considered under testimony do not figure
    prominently in the readings at the end of this chapter; nevertheless, the stu-
    dent must not suppose that the topic of testimony is not an important or
    frequent resource in argument. It will be a rare persuasive discourse that
    will not make some use of one of these six topics.

    The editorial about the Sacco-Vanzetti case at the end of this chapter, for
    instance, bases a great deal of its argument for its main thesis on the testi-
    mony presented in court about Sacco's cap. Dr. Johnson in paragraphs 6, 7,
    8 of his "The Liberty of the Pulpit" uses the precedent of the practices in
    the primitive Church as the basis for one of his arguments; and Edmund
    Burke, in paragraph 19 of his "Letter to a Noble Lord," uses the precedent
    of the Biblical Job to justify his answering the charges made against him. In
    paragraph 33 of "On Science and Culture," Dr. Oppenheimer paraphrases a
    statement of one of the greatest scientists of this century: "Einstein once said
    that a physical theory was not determined by the facts of nature, but was a
    free invention of the human mind." This is not so much an example of the
    topic of authority as it is an example of the topic of maxim.

    SPECIAL TOPICS 133

    Special Topics

    As pointed out in the introductory remarks of the previous section, rhetori-
    cans commonly divided the topics into two general kinds—common topics
    and special topics. Common topics were depositories of general arguments
    that one could resort to when discussing virtually any subject. Special topics
    on the other hand, were more particular lines of argument that one could
    resort to when discussing some particular subject. In the three main kinds
    of rhetorical activity—deliberative, judicial, and ceremonial—we tend to rely,
    fairly regularly, on certain topics which are more particular than common
    topics and yet more general than specialized knowledge. In a case at law,
    for instance, the teacher of rhetoric could not be expected to instruct his
    students in the points of law peculiar to this case; but he could point out to
    his students that most law cases turned on a limited number of recurring
    topics.

    The value of the special topics in the composition process is that once the
    student has determined which of the three kinds of rhetorical discourse he
    is committed to, he knows immediately what his general objective is and
    also the more or less special kinds of arguments that he must pursue to attain
    that objective. His composition will not therefore write itself, but he has in
    the special topics a springboard to launch him in the right direction. And
    once he has his general direction fixed, he will more readily detect which of
    the common topics and what specialized knowledge are pertinent and there-
    fore especially useful.

    Let us look now at the special topics for each of the three kinds of per-
    suasive discourse.

    SPECIAL TOPICS FOR DELIBERATIVE DISCOURSE

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Common and Special Topics in Rhetoric**\n\nGiven that common topics are general arguments applicable to any subject and special topics are specific arguments for particular subjects, explain how the concept of ''testimony'' functions as both a common and special topic in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two distinct contexts where ''testimony'' is used as a common topic.\n- **Step 2**: Identify two distinct contexts where ''testimony'' is used as a special topic.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how the text''s discussion of ''testimony'' demonstrates that it belongs to both categories.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s examples and demonstrate an understanding of how a single topic can serve multiple rhetorical functions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Special Topics in Rhetorical Discourse**\n\nFor deliberative discourse, the text describes special topics as arguments that are more particular than common topics but less specific than specialized knowledge. Explain how the example of law cases in the text supports this definition.\n- **Part A**: Describe the role of special topics in legal arguments as explained in the text.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast common topics with special topics in the context of legal cases.\n- **Part C**: Explain why the text emphasizes that special topics are not as specific as specialized legal knowledge.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s explanation of law cases and demonstrate an understanding of the hierarchy between common, special, and specialized knowledge.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Special Topics in Rhetorical Composition**\n\nThe text states that once a student determines the type of rhetorical discourse, special topics provide a ''springboard'' to launch his composition. Construct an example of how a student could use special topics to prepare for a deliberative speech on climate change.\n- **Part A**: Identify two special topics relevant to deliberative discourse on climate change.\n- **Part B**: Explain how these special topics guide the student''s argumentation and structure.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s discussion of special topics ensures that the student''s composition remains focused and purposeful.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your example must directly incorporate the text''s explanation of special topics and demonstrate an understanding of their role in rhetorical composition.'

    Are there some common denominators among the appeals that we use when we are engaged in exhorting someone to do or not to do something, to accept or to reject a particular view of things? There are indeed. When we are trying to persuade someone to do something, we try to show him that what we want him to do is either good or advantageous. All of our appeals in this kind of discourse can be reduced to these two heads: (1) the worthy (dignitas) or the good (bonum) and (2) the advantageous or expedient or useful (utilitas). The English terms do not express fully and precisely what the Latin terms denoted, but perhaps the English terms do convey the general idea of "what is good in itself" (and therefore worthy of being pursued for its own sake) and "what is good for us" (a relative good, if you will, one that would be expedient for us to pursue because of what it can do for us or what we can do with it). John Henry Newman used somewhat the same distinctions in his Idea of a University when he was trying to show us the difference between "liberal knowledge" and "useful knowledge." There are some subjects or disciplines, Newman maintained, that we cultivate for their own sakes, irrespective of the power they give us or the use to which they can be put. There are other subjects or disciplines that we cultivate primarily, if not exclusively, for the use to which we can put them.

    If we were trying to convince someone to study poetry, for instance, we might urge that the cultivation of poetry is a good in itself and therefore worthy of pursuit for its own sake and that it is no depreciation of the worth of poetry to admit that the study of poetry cannot be put to any practical uses. On the other hand, we might conduct our appeal on a less exalted level by showing that the study of poetry can produce practical results. The study of poetry can teach us, for instance, how to be more intensive readers, how to be more precise writers, how to be keener observers of the world about us.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Appeals in Persuasion**\n\nIdentify the two primary appeals used in persuasion and explain how they relate to the concepts of ''what is good in itself'' (dignitas/bonum) and ''what is good for us'' (utilitas).\n- **Step 1**: Define the two appeals based on the text''s explanation of dignitas/bonum and utilitas.\n- **Step 2**: Provide an example from the text where each appeal is explicitly used in a rhetorical argument.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why these two appeals are fundamental to persuasion, referencing the text''s discussion of ''liberal knowledge'' and ''useful knowledge'' by Newman.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the distinctions between intrinsic and extrinsic value as described in the text, with clear examples from the provided passage.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Strategies in Argument Construction**\n\nConstruct a persuasive argument for studying a specific subject (e.g., history, philosophy, mathematics) using both the ''worthy'' and ''expedient'' appeals.\n- **Part A**: Frame the argument by first presenting the ''worthy'' appeal, emphasizing the intrinsic value of the subject.\n- **Part B**: Then present the ''expedient'' appeal, explaining how studying this subject can lead to practical benefits.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the text''s discussion of ''liberal knowledge'' and ''useful knowledge'' informs your argument.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must clearly demonstrate the use of both appeals and reflect an understanding of how these appeals operate in different contexts as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Rhetorical Appeals in Education**\n\nAnalyze the text''s argument regarding ''liberal knowledge'' and ''useful knowledge'' in the context of education.\n- **Part A**: Compare and contrast the two types of knowledge as defined in the text.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example from the text where one type of knowledge is explicitly defended over the other.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of prioritizing one type of knowledge over the other in educational curricula, referencing the text''s discussion on the study of poetry.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate the distinctions between intrinsic and extrinsic value, as well as the examples given in the text, to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the rhetorical and educational arguments presented.'

    Whether we lean heaviest on the topic of the worthy or the topic of the advantageous will depend largely on two considerations: (1) the nature of our subject, (2) the nature of our audience. It should be obvious that some things are intrinsically more worthy than others. It is easier to demonstrate, for instance, that the study of poetry is a good in itself than to demonstrate that the building of a bridge is a good in itself. In the latter case, it would be the wiser course—because it is the easier and more cogent course—to exploit the topic of the advantageous. When one is trying to convince a group of taxpayers that they should vote for a bond issue to finance the building of a bridge, one is more likely to impress the taxpayers by demonstrating the usefulness of such a bridge than by showing its aesthetic value.

    So too the nature of our audience will influence our decision about the special topic to emphasize in a particular deliberative discourse. Because the audience is the chief determinant of the best means to effect a given end, we should have at least a general sense of the temper, interests, mores, and educational level of our audience. If we discern that our audience will be more impressed by appeals based on the topic of the worthy, then our knowledge of the audience will have to be a little fuller and a little more accurate, because now we must have, in addition to a general sense of the temper of the audience, some knowledge of just what things are regarded as "good" by this audience and what the hierarchy of good things is. Men being what they are, however, it is probably true, as Cicero and the author of the Ad Herennium observed, that the topic of advantage will appeal more frequently to more people than will the topic of worth.

    All deliberative discourses are concerned with what we should choose or what we should avoid. Aristotle observed that the end which determines what men choose and what they avoid is happiness and its constituents. Happiness then may be looked upon as the ultimate special topic in deliberative discourses, since we seek the worthy and the advantageous because they are conducive to our happiness. Unquestionably, men differ in their concept of happiness. Aristotle presented some of the commonly accepted definitions:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Topic Selection**\n\nUsing the reasoning in the text, explain how a speaker should determine whether to emphasize the topic of the worthy or the advantageous in a deliberative discourse.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the two main considerations mentioned in the text (nature of the subject and nature of the audience).\n- **Step 2**: For each consideration, explain how it influences the choice of rhetorical topic.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example from the text that illustrates when each topic is more appropriate.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish between the two considerations and demonstrate an understanding of how they shape rhetorical strategy in persuasion.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Aristotle''s Concept of Happiness**\n\nBased on the text, explain how Aristotle''s definition of happiness as the ultimate end in deliberative discourse relates to the choice between the topics of the worthy and the advantageous.\n- **Part A**: Define happiness according to Aristotle as presented in the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the pursuit of the worthy and advantageous is connected to achieving happiness.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how individual differences in the concept of happiness affect the effectiveness of deliberative discourses.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate Aristotle''s ideas with the text''s discussion of happiness as the ultimate special topic in rhetoric.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Rhetorical Appeals**\n\nThe text suggests that the topic of advantage appeals more frequently to people than does the topic of worth.\n- **Part A**: Construct a logical argument that supports this claim using the text''s reasoning.\n- **Part B**: Create a counterargument that challenges this claim, citing at least two points from the text.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate which argument is more convincing based on the text''s discussion of human nature and persuasion.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate critical thinking by engaging with the text''s arguments and counterarguments about rhetorical effectiveness.'

    We may define happiness as prosperity combined with virtue; or as independence of life; or as the secure enjoyment of the maximum of pleasure; or as a good condition of property and body, together with the power of guarding one's property and body and making use of them. That happiness is one or more of these things, pretty well everybody agrees.

    Rhetoric, I, 5.

    Even today, most people, if asked, would say that happiness was one or other of these conditions or perhaps some combination or modification of these.

    They would probably agree too with Aristotle's specifications of the constituent parts of happiness: "good birth, plenty of friends, good friends, wealth, good children, plenty of children, a happy old age, also such bodily excellences as health, beauty, strength, large stature, athletic powers, together with fame, honor, good luck, and virtue." One of the recurring themes in fantasies is the situation in which a good fairy allows a man three wishes. Presented with that opportunity, the man chooses the three things which he believes will make him happiest; and usually his choices will be some of those things enumerated in Aristotle's list. The student might ask himself what Ae would specify if he were allowed three choices. His choices would reveal not only a great deal about his scale of values but also how little his view of what constitutes happiness differs from the views that men have held down through the ages.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Happiness Definitions**\n\nUsing the definitions provided in the text, construct a modern interpretation of happiness that incorporates all three of the following elements:\n1. Prosperity combined with virtue\n2. Independence of life\n3. Secure enjoyment of the maximum of pleasure\n- **Step 1**: Define ''prosperity'' and ''virtue'' based on the text''s definitions.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how ''independence of life'' can be achieved through personal agency and financial stability.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how ''secure enjoyment of the maximum of pleasure'' relates to both material and spiritual well-being.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your interpretation must be comprehensive, explicitly reference the text''s definition of happiness, and demonstrate an understanding of how these elements interconnect.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Aristotelian Happiness Analysis**\n\nCompare and contrast the text''s version of happiness with Aristotle''s specifications.\n- **Part A**: Identify at least three components from Aristotle''s list that the text implies are essential to happiness.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the text''s definition of happiness as ''one or more of these things'' differs from Aristotle''s explicit enumeration.\n- **Part C**: Construct an example that illustrates how a modern individual might choose three things from Aristotle''s list that reflect their personal values and worldview.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text''s discussion of Aristotle and demonstrate an understanding of how modern interpretations align or diverge from classical views.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Ethical Reasoning on Happiness**\n\nConsider the scenario presented in the text where a man is given three wishes to achieve happiness.\n- **Part A**: Based on the text''s examples, list three potential wishes that would reflect a virtuous approach to happiness and explain why each aligns with the text''s definition.\n- **Part B**: Construct a counterexample to challenge the idea that happiness is solely dependent on material wealth or external circumstances.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s discussion of happiness relates to the concept of ''virtue'' as defined in classical philosophy.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s themes and demonstrate a clear understanding of how happiness is defined through both material and moral dimensions.'

    In summary then, let us say that when we are engaged in any kind of
    deliberative discourse, we are seeking to convince someone to adopt a certain
    course of action because it is conducive to his happiness or to reject a certain
    course of action because it will lead to unhappiness. The two main special
    topics under the general head of happiness are the worthy and the advan-
    tageous. In developing these special topics, we will sometimes have occasion
    to use some of the common topics, such as the possible and the impossible
    (when urging the advantage, for instance, of a certain course of action, we
    may have to show that the course we are advocating is practicable or easy)
    and the topic of more and less (when seeking to direct a choice from among
    a number of goods, for instance, we have need of criteria to help us dis-
    criminate degrees of good). In developing the special topics, we will also
    need a fund of specialized knowledge pertinent to the subject we are debat-
    ing. In discussing matters of public polity, for instance, we need a great
    deal of accurate and specific knowledge about kinds of government, the laws
    and constitution of a state, the mechanism of legislation. In addition, we must
    have at our fingertips, or know where to find, a sufficient number of facts,
    precedents, or statistics to support our assertions. It is not the special province
    of rhetoric to supply this specialized knowledge, but a rhetoric text like this
    can direct the student to the sources of such information. In a later section
    of this chapter, the student will be apprised of the standard reference works
    which can supply him with the specialized knowledge he may need to
    develop his discourse.

    For an analysis of the special topics, as well as common topics, in a deliber-
    ative discourse, see the analysis of "Xenophon Talks to the Soldiers" at the
    end of this chapter.

    Anyone reading the classical rhetorics soon discovers that the branch of rhetoric that received the most attention was the judicial, the oratory of the courtroom. Litigations in court in Greece and Rome were an extremely common experience for even the ordinary free citizen, and it was a rare citizen who did not go to court at least a half dozen times during the course of his adult life. Moreover, the ordinary citizen was often expected to serve as his own advocate before a judge or jury. The ordinary citizen did not possess the comprehensive knowledge of the law and its technicalities that the professional lawyer did, but it was greatly to his advantage to have a general knowledge of the strategies of defense and prosecution. As a result, the schools of rhetoric did a flourishing business in training the layman to defend himself in court or to prosecute his offending neighbor. In defending the usefulness of the art of rhetoric, Aristotle said, "It is absurd to hold that a man ought to be ashamed of being unable to defend himself with his limbs, but not of being unable to defend himself with speech and reason, when the use of rational speech is more distinctive of a human being than the use of his limbs.""—Rhetoric, I, 1.

    In our time, the majority of citizens—except perhaps for traffic offenses—rarely if ever make an appearance in court. If they do have to go to court, they may, technically, serve as their own counsel, but usually they will hire a professional lawyer to serve them. Some of the students who are reading this text will become lawyers, and before they graduate from law school, they will have received an intensive training in the technicalities of the law and in the conduct of trials. For most men today, however, there is no need to become conversant with the subtleties of the law or to train themselves to become shrewd, eloquent pleaders before a judge or jury.

    Training in this kind of rhetoric is, however, not entirely dispensable. All
    of us have occasion to indulge in this kind of persuasive discourse. We may
    never have to face the full panoply of the courtroom, but we do sometimes
    have to defend our actions or views, to impugn the actions of others, or to
    dispute the wording, interpretation, and application of texts of all kinds.

    The special topics for judicial discourse developed from the efforts to
    ascertain the status of a case. As we saw in the initial section of this chapter
    devoted to the formulation of the thesis, the rhetoricians set up a useful
    formula for determining precisely the issue that was to be discussed. In order
    to pinpoint the issue or thesis, they asked three questions about the general
    subject: whether a thing is (an sit), what it is (quid sit), of what kind it is
    (quale sit).

    Once the issue has been settled—and only then—the pleader, either for the
    defense or for the prosecution, can determine the special topics that will be
    pertinent to the development of the case. The ultimate special topics for all
    judicial discourse are justice and injustice. The terms right and wrong can
    serve as substitute terms if we take them in their legal, not moral sense.

    The sub-topics that can be used to develop the special topics of justice and
    injustice may be grouped under the three questions which serve to establish
    the issue:

    A. Whether Something Happened

    The major sub-topic here is evidence.
    In developing this topic we pursue questions like these:
    1. What is the evidence?
    2. How, when, where, and by whom was the evidence gathered?
    3. What about the reliability of the evidence?
    a. Is it accurate?
    b. Is it relevant?
    c. Is it consequential?
    d. Is it merely circumstantial?
    4. What about the credibility of the witnesses adducing the evidence?
    a. Are they prejudiced?
    b. Are they reliable?
    c. Are they competent?
    d. Are they consistent?
    5. What about the conflicting evidence?

    B. What It Is

    The major sub-topic here is definition.
    In developing this topic we pursue questions like these:
    1. What specifically is the charge being made?

    2. What is the legal definition of the alleged injustice?
    3. What law is supposedly violated?
    a. a written, promulgated law?
    b. an unwritten, natural law?
    (E.g. in Sophocles' play, Antigone pleads that although she had
    violated the written law of the community by burying her
    brother Polynices she was thereby obeying a higher law.)
    4. Who was harmed by the alleged injustice?
    a. an individual?
    b. the community?
    5. Did the victim suffer the harm against his will?
    6. What was the extent of the harm?

    C. The Quality of What Happened

    The major sub-topic here is motives or causes of action.
    In developing this topic we pursue questions like these:
    1. Was the alleged injustice done intentionally or unintentionally?
    2. If unintentionally, what was the cause of action?
    a. chance?
    b. compulsion?
    c. natural inclination?
    3. If intentionally, what was the cause of action?
    a. habit?
    b. deliberation?
    c. passion?
    d. appetite?
    4. If intentionally, what was the wrong-doer's motive?
    a. profit?
    b. revenge?
    c. punishment?
    d. pleasure?
    5. What kind of person was the doer of the act?
    6. What kind of person was the victim of the alleged injustice?
    7. Were there extenuating circumstances?

    The topics we have just reviewed are the things that we invariably discuss
    when we are seeking to exculpate ourselves or to inculpate someone else.
    These topics are especially useful in courtroom trials, involving felonies and
    other violations of civil law. But they are useful also in discussions of the
    justice and injustice of human acts which are something less than crimes—
    misdemeanors, errors of judgment, incompetency, neglect of duties, malevolence, etc. The questions set down under the various sub-topics can serve
    as "suggesters" or "prompters" of the direction our discussion might take
    when we are engaged in this kind of persuasive activity. For the development
    of the special topics, pertinent common topics will present themselves
    as other resources. The nature of the case under consideration will in every
    instance determine which of the special topics and common topics are relevant.

    SPECIAL TOPICS FOR CEREMONIAL DISCOURSE

    The nature of ceremonial discourse is perhaps easier to grasp than its dis-
    tinction from the other two kinds. Ceremonial discourse sometimes shades
    off into deliberative discourse, sometimes into judicial. The ceremonial
    orator did indeed seem to be more intent on impressing the audience with
    the eloquence of his laudatory efforts than he did on persuading his audience
    to adopt a certain course of action. But in praising a great man, he was
    suggesting, indirectly at least, that his audience go and do likewise; and in
    thus suggesting a course of action he was moving over into the realm of
    deliberative discourse. Likewise, when he praised or censured a man, he
    encroached on the province of judicial discourse, because like the lawyer
    in the courtroom he seemed to be engaged in exonerating or discrediting
    someone.

    Ceremonial discourse differs from deliberative discourse in that its primary
    object is to praise or censure someone, not to persuade men to do or not to do
    something. It differs from judicial discourse in that it does not deal primarily
    or exclusively with the characters of men charged with crime or misconduct.
    Unless we recognize this third category, we have no place to put such dis-
    courses as Fourth of July speeches, funeral orations, nominating speeches at
    political conventions, sermons, memoirs, obituaries, profiles, letters of refer-
    ence, citations, and those remarks that masters of ceremony make in intro-
    ducing a featured speaker. These forms are clearly distinct from deliberative
    or judicial discourse.

    What then are the special topics relevant to this kind of discourse? All
    the rhetoricians agreed that the general aim of ceremonial discourse is praise
    or censure of someone. This being the aim, the obvious special topics would
    be virtue and vice or, more generally, the noble and the base. We praise a
    man because of his good qualities; we censure him because of his bad quali-
    ties. Whereas judicial discourse is concerned primarily with a man's legal

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Ceremonial Discourse Characteristics**\n\nDescribe the distinct characteristics of ceremonial discourse as outlined in the text. Compare and contrast it with deliberative and judicial discourse, ensuring that your answer reflects the following distinctions:\n- Ceremonial discourse is primarily focused on praise or censure, whereas deliberative discourse aims to persuade action and judicial discourse deals with legal matters.\n- Ceremonial discourse can overlap with both deliberative and judicial discourse, depending on the context.\n- Ceremonial discourse encompasses a wide range of forms such as Fourth of July speeches, funeral orations, and sermons.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly define ceremonial discourse and its relationship to the other two forms of discourse, incorporating specific examples from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Special Topics in Ceremonial Discourse**\n\nUsing the text''s assertion that the primary special topics of ceremonial discourse are virtue and vice (or the noble and the base), analyze the following examples:\n- A eulogy for a deceased public figure who was known for their integrity and community service.\n- A speech honoring a military veteran for their bravery and sacrifice.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: For each example, identify which special topics are being highlighted.\n- **Part B**: Explain how these examples demonstrate the text''s claim that ceremonial discourse is about praising or censuring individuals based on their qualities.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the text''s distinction between virtue and vice is relevant to understanding the ethical implications of ceremonial discourse.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s definitions and provide specific examples that align with the stated special topics.'

     innocence or guilt, ceremonial discourse is concerned primarily with a man's
    moral goodness or badness.

    Although there are some virtues, like justice and courage, which have
    been universally acknowledged and esteemed by all people in all ages, certain
    other virtues enjoy a higher esteem in one civilization than they do in others.
    Humility, for instance, seemed not to have been a prized virtue in the civili-
    zation that Homer portrayed in the Iliad and the Odyssey; but in most Chris-
    tian cultures, humility is regarded as one of the supreme virtues. So once
    again we are reminded of the importance of the audience as a determinant
    of what is done in a persuasive discourse. The age and sex of an audience,
    its economic and educational level, its political and religious affinities, its
    interests and its values—all of these will have a great influence on the virtues
    that we tend to stress for a particular audience. A man's gentleness might be
    a virtue to stress before an audience made up exclusively of women; a man's
    courage might be the virtue to stress before an audience of laboring men.

    The following are the virtues that people commonly discuss when they
    are seeking to praise someone (in parentheses are the corresponding vices—
    those bad qualities that people mention when they are seeking to discredit
    someone) :

    1. Courage (Cowardice) :—fortitude is sometimes used as a synonym for
    this virtue, but fortitude is a broader term, signifying imperturbability in the
    face not only of dangerous situations but of all trying situations.

    2. Temperance (Incontinence) :—the virtue (and vice) connected with phys-
    ical pleasures of all kinds.

    3. Justice (Injustice) :—these terms are to be taken in a somewhat narrower
    sense than they had as special topics in judicial discourse. For example, we
    might define justice as the virtue that respects the natural and legal rights
    of other men.

    4. Liberality (Illiberality) :—generosity or even charity might be other words
    for the virtue which disposes us to expend time, money, or effort for the
    good of others.

    5. Magnanimity (Meanness of spirit) :—akin to liberality but carries the im-
    plication of good one does for others on a large scale or in reversal of ex-
    pectations.

How might a speaker adjust their message to align with different values of the audience?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion on cultural differences and audience influence, showing how these factors shape rhetorical strategies.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Logical Reasoning with Virtue Classifications\n\nThe text categorizes virtues and vices, such as courage (cowardice) and justice (injustice). Consider the virtue of ''temperance'' as described in the text:\n- **Part A**: Explain why temperance is considered a virtue, using the definition provided.\n- **Part B**: Create a counterexample to disprove the claim: ''Temperance is only relevant in times of excess.'' Your example must be based on the text''s definition and show how temperance applies in a different context.\n- **Part C**: Compare ''temperance'' with ''magnanimity'' as defined in the text.

    6. Prudence (Rashness):—an intellectual virtue which disposes a man to make wise decisions about means and ends.

    7. Gentleness (Brutality):—kindness, because a broader, might be a better term.

    SPECIAL TOPICS 141

    This list does not exhaust the virtues (and vices) by any means. It will merely suggest the sort of qualities of character that people of all ages and cultures value in a man and that contribute to the esteem in which a man is held. In general, those virtues which produce benefits for others will be more highly regarded than the virtues which are good mainly for the person who possesses them. It is noteworthy that many of the Beatitudes that Christ mentioned in his famous Sermon on the Mount are social virtues—virtues that result in benefits for others. It is true that we do laud a man for his personal saintliness (and personal sanctification must be each man's primary goal), but it is easier to praise the man whose virtues benefit others besides himself. It was for this reason that St. Paul designated charity as the greatest of the virtues.

    While virtue is the special topic that we most exploit in praising a man, there are other attributes and circumstances that we mention when we are seeking to convince others of a man's worthiness. For instance:

    1. Physical attributes—agility, strength, beauty, health

    2. External circumstances—family background, education, economic status, political, social, religious affiliations

    3. Actions and achievements

    4. Sayings

    5. Testimony of others

    The student may have noted how many of the resources that one uses in ceremonial discourse are the devices that novelists, dramatists, and short-story writers use to characterize the people in their fictions. The writer of narrative uses dialogue (what a man says and how he says it), action (what a man does and how he does it), descriptions of physical appearance, testimony of other characters in the story, and straight exposition of personality to give his readers an idea of the characters that figure in his story. The narrative writer has one more resource, however, that is not available to the writer or speaker engaged in praising or censuring someone: he can reveal the thoughts of his characters—the truest index of a man's moral bent.

    Aristotle observed that the common topic of amplification and depreciation is most suitable for ceremonial discourse, for when we seek to praise a man it is natural that we should try to magnify or amplify his virtues and to minimize or extenuate his vices; and when we intend to censure a man, we do just the opposite—we magnify his vices and minimize his virtues. Aristotle pointed out some of the useful ways of heightening the effect of praise:

    1. Show that a man is the first one or the only one or almost the only one to do something.
    2. Show that a man has done something better than anyone else, for superiority of any kind is thought to reveal excellence.
    3. Show that a man has often achieved the same success, for this will indicate that his success was due not to chance but to his own powers.
    4. Show the circumstances under which a man accomplished something, for it will redound more to his credit if he has accomplished something under adverse conditions.
    5. Compare him with famous men, for the praise of a man will be magnified if we can show that he has equalled or surpassed other great men.

    Variations of these points can be used to depreciate a man. If we can show, for instance, that many men have done the same thing, we can minimize a man's achievements.

    For an analysis of the special topics, as well as common topics, in a ceremonial discourse, see the analysis of Pericles' "Funeral Oration" at the end of this chapter.

    In this section, we have reviewed the topics that we usually resort to when we are seeking to convince an audience that a man is great or noble or virtuous or competent (or the opposite—that he is insignificant or base or vicious or inept). Not all of these topics will be available to us on every occasion. If a man does not possess a particular virtue or does not possess it to a pre-eminent degree, we cannot, obviously, extol that virtue in the man. If a particular virtue has no special appeal for a particular audience, it would be unwise of us to dwell on it. And if a particular virtue is not especially pertinent to the occasion, we do little to enhance the praise of a man by expatiating on that attribute. As in most rhetorical activities, we must develop instincts for what is most appropriate and most effective. Because such instincts are among "the nameless graces beyond the reach of art," rhetoric cannot equip the student with those instincts; it can only point the way.

    External Aids to Invention

    We have been considering the topics, those "places" to which the writer can resort for help in inventing or discovering arguments. The topics might be termed the "artistic means of persuasion" (technai pistes), because they are the means taught by the art of rhetoric. In addition to these, Aristotle spoke of the "non-artistic means of persuasion" (atechnai pisteis)—‘non-artistic' in the sense that these resources did not belong specifically to the art of rhetoric; the information came from "outside."

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Strategies**\n\nIn the text, it is stated that when seeking to convince an audience of a person''s greatness, certain topics are more effective than others. Consider the following scenario: You are preparing a speech to honor a community leader who is known for their generosity but has recently faced criticism for being overly involved in local politics.\n- **Part A**: Identify and explain two topics that would be most appropriate to emphasize in this speech. Justify your choice based on the text''s discussion of how certain virtues are more relevant to specific audiences.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the implications of not being able to extol a particular virtue (e.g., integrity) if the speaker has no evidence of it in the subject. Use examples from the text to support your reasoning.\n- **Part C**: Propose a rhetorical strategy that balances the use of artistic and non-artistic means of persuasion. Explain how this approach aligns with the text''s emphasis on developing instincts for what is most appropriate and effective.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of rhetorical topics and the distinction between artistic and non-artistic means of persuasion. It must also demonstrate an understanding of when and how to use different strategies in persuasive communication.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Non-Artistic Means of Persuasion**\n\nThe text describes non-artistic means of persuasion as resources that come from outside the art of rhetoric. Consider a situation where you are asked to prepare a speech for a historical figure who is known for their controversial decisions.\n- **Part A**: Identify two non-artistic resources that could be used to support the speech. Explain how these resources are not part of the art of rhetoric but provide credible information.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the use of these non-artistic resources with artistic means. Use examples from the text to illustrate how each method contributes to persuasion.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the limitations of relying solely on non-artistic means, as mentioned in the text. Provide a rationale for why artistic methods are still necessary even when non-artistic resources are available.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s distinction between artistic and non-artistic means of persuasion. It must also show an ability to apply this knowledge to a real-world scenario involving historical figures.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Rhetorical Invention**\n\nThe text discusses the importance of developing instincts for what is most appropriate and effective in rhetoric. Consider the following scenario: A student is writing an essay to argue that a particular policy is beneficial for society.\n- **Part A**: Analyze the student''s potential use of artistic means (topics like virtue, competence) and non-artistic means (e.g., statistics, expert opinions). Explain how each contributes to the argument.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the text''s claim that ''rhetoric cannot equip the student with those instincts.'' How can a student develop these instincts without explicit instruction? Provide examples from the text to support your reasoning.\n- **Part C**: Construct a hypothetical situation where relying on artistic means alone would be insufficient. Explain why non-artistic resources are necessary in that scenario and how the student might integrate both approaches effectively.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the text''s discussion on rhetorical invention and the distinction between artistic and non-artistic means. It must also show an ability to apply this knowledge to a practical scenario involving policy arguments.'

    If reference books had been abundant in fifth-century Athens, Aristotle would certainly have encouraged his students to consult them as external aids to invention. Because of the need for a plentiful stock of special knowledge, Cicero and Quintilian maintained that a broad liberal education was the best background for an orator. While acquiring this broad background, students can compensate for their deficiencies by knowing about and resorting to the standard reference books. Although most college libraries are well stocked with reference works, many students do not know that they exist, or do not know what kind of information is contained in them, or do not know how to use them to find the information they contain.

Most students have at one time or other consulted either the Encyclopedia Americana (New York: Encyclopedia Americana Corporation, 1949, 30 volumes) or the Encyclopaedia Britannica (Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1949, 24 volumes), but they should be reminded to make more use of the Index (the last volume in each set) and the yearbooks, and they should not neglect the long scholarly articles written by noted British authors in the ninth and eleventh editions of the Britannica. The articles in Collier's Encyclopedia (New York: P. F. Collier & Son Corporation, 1950, 20 volumes) are written on a level between that of the juvenile encyclopedias students may have used at home and that of the adult encyclopedias just mentioned. Students should become familiar with the new edition of the famous Chambers's Encyclopaedia (London and New York: Oxford University Press, 1950, 15 volumes), the most respected of the general reference works published in England. Of more specialized interest are the Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences (New York: Macmillan Company, 1930-35, 15 volumes), the Jewish Encyclopedia (New York: Funk and Wagnalls Company, 1930-46, 12 volumes) or the more up-to-date Universal Jewish Encyclopedia (New York: Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, Inc., 1939-44, 10 volumes), and the Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: Catholic Encyclopedia, 1907-14, 16 volumes), which will soon be superseded by a new edition.

    A cyclopedia of British biography on the plan and scope of some of the other
    European biographical collections (the French, 40 volumes, 1843-63; the
    Dutch, 24 volumes, 1852–78; the Austrian, 60 volumes, 1856–91; the German,
    55 volumes, 1875–1900). On January 1, 1885, the first volume appeared, con-
    taining 505 biographies written by 87 contributors. Within fifteen years, this
    monumental 63-volume work, containing 29,120 biographies, was completed.
    In the autumn of 1901, three supplementary volumes were published, con-
    taining about 800 biographical sketches of noteworthy Englishmen who had
    died while the work was in progress and about 200 memoirs of prominent
    people who had been overlooked in the original master-list. (This became
    Volume XXII of the Macmillan re-issue.) In 1912 Macmillan issued three
    more volumes to cover the years 1901–11. The Oxford University Press has
    been publishing the supplementary volumes, each covering a decade.

    According to the original prospectus, the Dictionary of National Biography
    (DNB) was designed to provide "full, accurate, and concise biographies of
    all noteworthy inhabitants of the British Islands and the Colonies (exclusive
    of living persons) from the earliest historical period to the present time."
    The lives are arranged alphabetically according to surnames. If the student
    seeks the biography of a British subject who died in the twentieth century,
    he should consult the appropriate supplementary volume.

    The value of the DNB is that it is often the only source of biographical
    information about British men and women who were prominent enough to
    have merited mention in newspapers and histories but not prominent enough
    to have merited a full-length biography or even a biographical sketch in an
    encyclopedia. The DNB is also helpful to someone seeking relatively brief
    but authoritative biographies of prominent statesmen, generals, clergymen,
    scientists, writers, painters, etc. The longest biography in the DNB is the
    49-page memoir that Sidney Lee wrote on Shakespeare. Although many of

    The biographers are given less than a page, most of the prominent ones re-
    ceive an extended but compact treatment. Additional sources of biographical
    information, whenever available, are listed in the bibliography at the end
    of each article.

    Dictionary Of American Biography, ed. Allen Johnson and others
    (New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1928-36), 20 vols.; Volume
    XXI, Supplement One; Volume XXII, Supplement Two.

    This collection of American biographies, initiated by the American Council
    of Learned Societies in 1922, was patterned on the Dictionary of National
    Biography. The editorial committee set down these negative restrictions: (1)
    no living persons; (2) no persons who had not lived in the territory known
    as the United States; (3) no British officers serving in America after the
    colonies had declared their independence. The positive qualification for in-
    clusion was stated in rather general terms: "those who have made some
    significant contribution to American life." These criteria permitted the ad-
    mission into the DAB of people who are not, strictly speaking, Americans:
    Lafayette, for instance.

    The original twenty volumes contained 13,633 biographical articles. Sup-
    plement One (to December 31, 1935), published in 1944, added 652 memoirs.
    Supplement Two (to December 31, 1940), published in 1958, added 585
    biographies.

    Like the DNB, the DAB is often the only source of biographical informa-
    tion about deceased, relatively obscure Americans; but the DAB also provides
    compact biographical sketches of prominent Americans. The memoir of
    Benjamin Franklin, for instance, occupies twenty-five full columns in Vol-
    ume VI. James Franklin (1696/7-1735), his half-brother, rates only a column
    and a half in the same volume. The biographies are based on reliable,
    original sources of information, many of which are listed in the carefully
    selected bibliographies at the end of each article. The biographies are arranged
    alphabetically according to the last name of the subject.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Biographical Criteria**\n\nUsing the criteria provided in the text, determine whether the following individuals should be included in the Dictionary of American Biography (DAB):\n- **Lafayette** (a French military leader who fought in the American Revolution)\n- **Benjamin Franklin** (a Founding Father and statesman)\n- **A contemporary British citizen who has made significant contributions to American culture**\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Apply the three negative restrictions from the text to each individual.\n- **Part B**: Evaluate whether each individual meets the positive qualification of ''significant contribution to American life.''\n- **Part C**: Justify your conclusion for Lafayette using the text''s explanation of why he was admitted despite not being a native American.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly reference the text''s criteria and demonstrate logical reasoning based on the provided definitions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Biographical Sources**\n\nThe text mentions that the DAB is ''often the only source of biographical information about deceased, relatively obscure Americans.'' Explain how this statement reflects on the scope and limitations of the DAB compared to other biographical resources.\n- **Part A**: Compare the DAB''s coverage with that of the Dictionary of National Biography (DNB).\n- **Part B**: Discuss the implications for researchers seeking information about prominent Americans.\n- **Part C**: Provide an example of a situation where the DAB would be more useful than other biographical sources.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s descriptions of the DAB and DNB, demonstrating an understanding of their respective focuses and uses.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Biographical Classification**\n\nThe text describes the DAB as including ''those who have made some significant contribution to American life.'' Examine the criteria for inclusion in the DAB and evaluate whether the following individuals are appropriately included based on the text''s definitions:\n- **A famous author who has written extensively about American history**\n- **A foreign diplomat who facilitated trade between the United States and another country**\n- **A living person who has recently won a major award in the arts**\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Apply the negative restrictions and positive qualification from the text to each individual.\n- **Part B**: Determine whether each is included in the DAB based on the text''s criteria.\n- **Part C**: Explain why the criterion of ''significant contribution to American life'' is a more flexible standard than the rigid criteria of the DNB.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s inclusion criteria and their implications for biographical classification.'

    This is a valuable source of biographical data about prominent living Americans. Begun in 1899, this work is revised and re-issued every two years. The introduction to Volume XXX gives the criteria for inclusion:

    The standards of admission divide the eligible into two classes: (1) those selected on account of special prominence in creditable lives of effort, making them the subjects of extensive interest, inquiry, or discussion;
    (2) those included arbitrarily on account of position—civil, military, religious, educational, corporate, or organizational.

    Among those in the second category are all members of congress and the cabinet, federal judges, governors of states, heads of the larger universities, military officers above the rank of brigadier general, members of the National Academy, bishops and chief ecclesiastics of the larger religious denominations. Insisting that its biographees lead "creditable lives," the Marquis Company automatically drops from later volumes any biographee who has been convicted of a major crime or felony.

    Most of the biographees supply their own biographical information. Although the kinds of information sought are fixed by the editors, the amount of information supplied is left largely up to the biographee. In Volume XXX, for instance, President Eisenhower has only 19 lines; his brother Milton, the president of Johns Hopkins University, has 52 lines.

    The student should remember that this is a reference source for living Americans only. When a person dies, he may then be relegated to another Marquis publication, Who Was Who in America. The three volumes of this work now available draw from the entire span of Who's Who in America Volumes I-XXXI. In order to find information on his subject, the student must remember to consult those volumes covering the years when the subject was in the public eye.

    Who's Who (London: Adam and Charles Black; New York: Macmillan, 1848–).

    Who's Who, the older British work, first published in 1848, served as the pattern for the American biographical dictionary. It supplies biographical information about noteworthy living British subjects, and its criteria of eligibility are much the same as those in the American dictionary.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Biographical Inclusion Criteria**\n\nThe Marquis Who''s Who and the British Who''s Who share similar criteria for including individuals in their biographical dictionaries. Using the text, compare and contrast the two works'' criteria for inclusion.\n- **Part A**: Identify the two categories of eligibility described in the text and explain their differences.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the Marquis Company ensures the credibility of its biographical subjects.\n- **Part C**: Analyze why the Marquis publication is described as a reference source for living Americans only.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the text''s descriptions of both works and demonstrate an understanding of how their inclusion criteria reflect their respective purposes as reference sources.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Biographical Information Retrieval**\n\nA student is researching a historical figure who was included in the Marquis Who''s Who. The student knows that the subject is a prominent American from the 19th century, and the person was not a member of Congress or the cabinet.\n- **Part A**: Based on the text, what category would this individual most likely fall into? Explain your reasoning.\n- **Part B**: The student is trying to find information on a subject who died in 1895. What volumes of the Marquis publication should the student consult? Justify your answer using the text''s information.\n- **Part C**: Explain why a person who is no longer alive may be found in another publication, such as *Who Was Who in America*.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s information about the Marquis publication and its relationship to other biographical works.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Biographical Classification**\n\nThe text describes the Marquis Company''s policy of removing individuals convicted of major crimes from later volumes.\n- **Part A**: What is the significance of this policy in maintaining the credibility of the publication?\n- **Part B**: How does the text suggest that the Marquis Company''s approach to biographical information reflects broader societal values?\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument for why the criteria used by the Marquis Company might be considered more rigorous than those of the British Who''s Who.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s descriptions of both publications and demonstrate an understanding of the implications of their inclusion criteria on the credibility and purpose of each work.'

    Each volume of Who's Who begins with an obituary of the prominent
    people who have died since the last volume appeared. Once deceased, these
    people appear in a later volume of a companion work called Who Was Whe.
    Five volumes of Who Was Who have now been published, covering the
    period 1897-1960.

    The term "Who's Who" has become as much of a household word as
    "Webster's," and people often use the term indiscriminately to refer to both
    the American and the British works.

    INTERNATIONAL WHO'S WHO (London: Europe Publications, 1935–_).

    The biographies in this annual compilation are very brief, but a great many
    notable people throughout the world are covered. Many of the people covered
    in this work are included in the various national biographical dictionaries,
    but this is a convenient reference work for those who cannot afford to buy
    several of the national dictionaries. Another valuable feature of the work is
    that notable people from smaller countries whose biographies are not avail-
    able in the usual sources are included.

    CURRENT BIOGRAPHY (New York: H. W. Wilson Company, 1940–__).

    Current Biography, published annually, is another valuable source of bio-
    graphical information about prominent contemporary people. It is differenr
    in many ways from Who's Who in America and Who's Who: the 1941 vol-
    ume of Current Biography, for instance, contains only gg1 biographical
    sketches, but it is world wide in its scope. The biographical sketches in
    Current Biography are composed by members of the editorial staff, not
    supplied by the biographees.
    Here is the typical organization of a volume of Current Biography:

    1. The biographical section, arranged alphabetically according to last names.
    This section comprises full biographies (usually two or three pages) of
    the prominent living persons selected for that particular year and short
    obituary notices of some prominent persons who have died that year.

    2. A necrology—a list of all the prominent people who have died that year.

    3. Index to biographies (in that particular volume) by profession.

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Biographical Context**\n\nThe text describes the relationship between *Who''s Who* and *Who Was Who*, where deceased individuals are included in a companion work.\n- **Part A**: Construct an argument for why *Who''s Who* is more likely to include deceased individuals than *Current Biography*.\n- **Part B**: Create a counterexample to the claim that ''all biographical works are focused on living people.'' Your example must reference the text''s description of *Who''s Who* and *Current Biography*.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the text''s mention of ''notable people from smaller countries'' being included in *Who''s Who* supports the idea that biographical works are not limited to major national figures.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s specific examples and demonstrate logical reasoning based on their descriptions.'

    4. A cumulative index of biographers. If the student does not find in this
    volume a biography of the subject he is seeking, this section will refer him
    to any earlier volume in which this subject is included.

    Now that more than twenty volumes have appeared, Current Biography
    has become a valuable source of biographical information about world figures.
    Although each volume has an index of previously published biographies, the
    student will save time in finding the volume and pages if he will consult
    the two volumes that carry the cumulative indexes for the entire twenty-
    year span of this reference work. The 1950 volume provides a cumulative
    index for 1940-1950; the 1960 volume, the cumulative index for 1951-1960.

    The most famous of these one-volume reference works is Chambers's Bio-
    graphical Dictionary. First published in 1897, it has recently appeared in a
    new edition of 1,432 double-column pages containing some 15,000 biographi-
    cal articles. It treats of the famous men and women of all periods, all
    countries, and all occupations and professions. The amount of coverage varies
    with the prominence of the biographee. The present editor has adopted this
    standard sequence of basic information: (1) surname, (2) Christian names
    and titles, (3) pronunciation (of difficult or unusual names), (4) date of birth
    and death, (5) nationality and main occupation, (6) birthplace (if known).
    At the end of the articles on the major figures there is a list of works where
    additional information may be found. A unique feature of this work is the
    subject index of some 6,000 items through which biographees may be traced
    through titles of works, events, places, campaigns, nicknames, etc.

    Webster's Biographical Dictionary presents about 40,000 brief biographies
    of historical and contemporary figures in 1,732 pages. Published in 1943, this
    work is not as up-to-date on living men and women as the new edition of
    Chambers's. It is, however, a handy, surprisingly comprehensive source of
    biographical information about a large number of world figures.

    As its title indicates, The Dictionary of Catholic Biography is a reference
    work of more limited scope. It does not cover living men and women, but
    the biographies of the 3,000 Catholics that it does supply in its 1,260 double-
    column pages are usually more extensive than those in the other two one-
    volume biographical dictionaries. In the appendix there is a list of patron
    saints and a 14-page chart correlating the reigns of popes and world rulers.

    The Biography Index is a helpful guide to biographical material in currently
    published, English-language books and pamphlets, in over 1,500 periodicals,
    in some legal and medical journals, and in the obituary notices of the New
    York Times. All types of biographical material are indexed: "pure biography,
    critical material of biographical significance, autobiography, letters, diaries,
    memoirs, journals, genealogies, fiction, drama, poetry, bibliographies, obit-
    uaries, pictorial works, and juvenile literature."

    The Biography Index has two main parts: (1) the subject index, arranged
    alphabetically by last name; (2) the index to professions and occupations
    (large categories, like Authors, are listed by nationality—American, Austral-
    ian, British, etc.). The value of the latter section is that it can direct the
    inquirer to all the biographical material written, in some specific year, about
    men associated with some profession. A student assigned to do a paper on
    EXTERNAL AIDS TO INVENTION I49

    say, atomic physicists since World War II could collect a bibliography in
    short order by consulting this section.

    As evidence of the amazing comprehensiveness of this work, the first
    bound volume of Biography Index (January 1946 to July 1949) contains the
    names of over 40,000 biographees, classified into some 1,000 categories in the
    index to professions and occupations. Paperbound supplements are published
    quarterly and are bound in a separate volume, with a cumulative index,
    each year. Subsequently, a three-year cumulation is published and bound in
    a separate volume.

    Bartlett's Familiar Quotations is the best known and perhaps the most fre-
    quently used reference guide to quotations. John Bartlett, a New England
    publisher, compiled his first book of quotations in 1855, and continued to
    edit it through its ninth edition in 1891. In 1914 Nathan Haskell Dole edited
    the tenth edition. Christopher Morley and Louella D. Everett edited the
    book in its eleventh (1937), twelfth (1948), and thirteenth (1955) editions.

    All of us, at some time or another, have needed an apt quotation to illus-
    trate, enhance, or substantiate something we have written, or the exact
    wording of a quotation, or the author of the quotation, or the name of the
    work in which the quotation first appeared, or the exact place in a work
    (e.g. the specific line-number in a poem) where the quotation appeared. If
    we can remember any key-word in the quotation, it is likely that we can
    find the answer to such questions in Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.

    Let us suppose that we want to discover the source of the quotation, "Hope
    springs eternal in the human breast." Since quotations are not indexed under
    prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, articles, and common words, like zs
    and was, we can find this quotation indexed under any one of five key words:
    Hope, springs, eternal, human, breast. The number of entries listed under
    each of the five key-words is as follows: Hope, 156; springs, 20; eternal, 70;
    human, 190; breast, 59. The student who looked for this quotation under the
    word springs would probably have found the quotation sooner than the
    student who looked under the word human.

    The twelfth, and notably enlarged, edition of Bartlett's is a book of more
    than 1,800 pages, 1,254 pages of which are given over to the quotations, to-

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Quotation Retrieval Strategies**\n\nUsing the information provided about Bartlett''s Familiar Quotations, explain how a student would efficiently locate the quotation ''Hope springs eternal in the human breast.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify which key words from the quotation could be used for indexing.\n- **Step 2**: Compare the number of entries under each key word to determine the most efficient search path.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why searching under ''springs'' would be more efficient than searching under ''human.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly outline the retrieval strategy and reference the specific data provided (e.g., ''The word "springs" has 20 entries, which is fewer than the 190 entries under "human", indicating a more efficient search path'').'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Quotation Indexing**\n\nIf a student is searching for the quotation ''A rose by any other name would smell as sweet,'' which key word in the quotation would be most likely to result in finding it quickly? Justify your answer using the indexing principles described in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify potential key words from the quotation.\n- **Step 2**: Consider how many entries would be listed under each key word (e.g., ''rose,'' ''name,'' ''sweet'').\n- **Step 3**: Use logical reasoning to determine which key word would lead to the quickest discovery.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reference the text''s explanation about how quotations are indexed and explain why one key word is more efficient than others.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving with Quotation Sources**\n\nImagine you are researching the source of the quotation ''The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' Using Bartlett''s Familiar Quotations, how would you determine the original work and author of this quotation?\n- **Step 1**: Determine which key words from the quotation could be used for indexing.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how you would use the information from the index to trace back to the original source.\n- **Step 3**: Construct a logical argument for why this method is effective, based on the text''s explanation of indexing principles.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of how the indexing system works and provide a step-by-step plan for finding the source of any quotation.'

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Quotation Classification**\n\nThe text mentions that concordances are available for major poets but not commonly for prose writers. Consider the claim: ''Concordances are more useful for poetic works than for prose.''\n- **Part A**: Evaluate the validity of this claim using the text''s information about concordances for Shakespeare and James Joyce.\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument that explains why the text''s emphasis on concordances for dramatic works (like Shakespeare) might be more practical than for prose writers.\n- **Part C**: Provide a counterexample to the claim that ''all concordances are for poetic works.'' Your example must reference at least one prose work mentioned in the text (e.g., James Joyce''s ''Ulysses'').\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s information about concordances and demonstrate logical reasoning based on the distinction between poetic and prose works.'

    As might be expected, many concordances have been prepared for Shakespeare's works. The best and the most comprehensive of these is the one compiled by the same John Bartlett who published Familiar Quotations.

    This concordance works in the same way as the others we have considered. All of the lines in Shakespeare's poems and plays are indexed under all of the significant words in the line. Bartlett uses the act, scene, and line numbering as given in the 1891 Globe Edition of Shakespeare, and he always prints the entire line in his index, not just a portion of it.

    Some people use a concordance like this as the basis for a stylistic study of an author or, more specifically, for a study of his diction. Did Shakespeare ever use such-and-such a word? How many times did he use a particular word? What about the range and variety of his vocabulary? A study of Shakespeare's imagery could also be worked out with the aid of a concordance.

    Only three of the many biblical concordances are listed above—one for the King James or Authorized Version of the Bible; one for the Douay or Roman Catholic version; and one for the Revised Standard Version completed in 1952. Every college library of any size is sure to have one or more of the biblical concordances on its reference shelves. It took James Strong some thirty years to compile his concordance; it took Remington Rand's Univac only about 1000 hours to index more than 350,000 biblical contexts from the RSVB. When the Cambridge and Oxford University Presses complete their publication of the New English Bible, someone will undoubtedly prepare a concordance, probably with the aid of an electronic computing machine, for this latest English translation.

    The index system of a biblical concordance works in much the same way as it does in Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, but whereas Bartlett's reproduces the quotations it indexes, the biblical concordances do not include the text.

    A complete concordance indexes all passages from the Bible, not just the familiar quotations from it. If one can remember any key word in a quotation (quotations are not indexed under articles, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, or auxiliary or linking verbs), he can find what he is looking for.

    There are other uses for a concordance too. One could use the concordance to find out, for instance, whether the word sacrament ever occurred in the Old or New Testaments. One could find out when such a word as bishop became a part of ecclesiastical terminology, whether the Old Testament prophets ever used the word, whether Christ ever used the word in the Gospels, or whether it is found only in the Acts of the Apostles or in the Epistles. The concordance can serve too as a kind of harmony—that is, as a reference guide to various passages in the Bible where parallel or identical ideas or wordings occur.

    Of all the periodical indexes, the Readers' Guide is the one the student has
    most likely used during his high-school years. It is an extremely useful refer-
    ence guide to articles, stories, poems, and plays published in more than one
    hundred American magazines during the twentieth century. Since March,
    1935, it has been appearing twice a month. The indexing is cumulated, first
    in annual volumes and then in two-year volumes which contain in one alpha-
    betical listing all entries for the period covered.

    The Readers' Guide is primarily a subject and author index, but short
    stories, poems, plays, and motion pictures are listed by title as well as under
    the author's name. When entries appear under a person's name in two dif-
    ferent listings, the first group of articles refers to articles by that person as
    an author; the second group of articles refers to articles about that person as
    a subject. Here are examples, first of an author entry, then of a subject entry:

    The first thing that appears under the author's name is the title of his article (usually only the first word is capitalized). Then appears the name of the magazine, in abbreviated form (at the front of each volume a key to abbreviations is given). This article appeared in Foreign Affairs. Following the title of the magazine is a series of numbers specifying the issue of the magazine in which this article appeared. The number before the colon is the volume number of the periodical (the bound volume of the periodical in the library usually carries this same volume number). After the colon are the page numbers of the article. A + sign after a page number indicates that the article is continued on other pages toward the back of the magazine. Then the date of the issue is given in abbreviated form. If the magazine is a monthly, as in this case, only the month (July) and the year (1955) are given; if the magazine is a weekly (see below), the month (March), day (12), and year (1955) are given. If the student is compiling a list of articles for later investigation, he should be careful to record the exact volume number and date of the magazine, because the librarian will need this information on the call-slip that the student submits.

    The second item is a subject heading (Censorship). All the articles published on that subject during the period covered by this particular volume will be listed, and often there will be "see also" references to other subject headings. In the subject entries, the titles of articles are given first. Then the name of the author is given (in subject entries the author's first name is represented by the initial capital only). The absence of a name after the title of the article indicates an anonymous or unsigned article.

    The International Index is a useful supplementary index to periodical literature. During the first fifty years of its coverage, the International Index covered foreign-language periodicals as well as English-language periodicals. With the volume for 1955-7, however, the title of this reference work was changed from International Index to Periodicals to International Index, A Guide to Periodical Literature in Social Sciences and Humanities. With this change of title, the coverage of scientific and foreign-language periodicals was curtailed in favor of concentration on the more scholarly English-language journals throughout the world which deal with the social sciences and the humanities. At present the International Index indexes about 175 journals. Published quarterly in paperback editions, it eventually appears as a bound volume with a two-year cumulation. A subject and author index, it uses the same style of notation as the Readers' Guide. Students seeking a full bibliography of magazine articles on some subject should consult the International Index in addition to the Readers' Guide. For certain subjects (e.g. topics of more scholarly interest), the International Index is a more useful reference guide than the Readers' Guide.

    indexes material in fifty-one English and American magazines that were
    being published late in the last century. In some cases, the indexing has been
    extended beyond the limits specified by the title. The National Geographic
    Magazine, for instance, is indexed from 1888, the year it began publication,
    to December 1908, when it begins to be indexed by the Readers' Guide. The
    British Cornhill Magazine, a periodical that published contributions from
    such distinguished writers as Thackeray, Ruskin, Arnold, and Trollope, is
    indexed from January 1890, to December 1922, when it was picked up by
    the International Index. The 19th Century Guide adopts the standard list of
    subject headings and cross references used by the other periodical guides, has
    author entries, and gives title indexes to short stories, novels, plays, and
    poems.

    Poote's INnpEx To PeriopicaL Literature, ed. William Frederick
    Poole and William I. Fletcher, 6 vols. (New York: Houghton Miff-
    lin, 1882-1907).

    Poole's Index is the only index to English-language periodicals of the nine-
    teenth century up to 1890. It was initiated by William F. Poole, librarian at
    the Mercantile Library of Boston, the public libraries in Cincinnati and
    Chicago, and, at the time of his death in 1894, the famous Newberry Library
    in Chicago. His colleague William Fletcher had a hand in the preparation of
    all the volumes and after Poole's death was assisted by Franklin O. Poole
    and Mary Poole. Poole's Index with its five supplements covered 479 different
    periodicals and included more than 590,000 references.

    Poole's Index is a subject index only. Writers are entered only when they
    are treated as subjects. Thus Thomas Babington Macaulay's contributions to
    the Edinburgh Review are entered not under Macaulay's name but under
    the subjects he wrote about—Milton, church and state, Clive, Machiavelli,
    etc. Critical articles on poetry, the drama, and prose fiction appear under the
    name of the author whose work is being criticized. Hence a critical article
    on Dombey and Son would appear under "Charles Dickens."

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Periodical Indexing Trends**\n\nCompare the indexing practices of the National Geographic Magazine and the British Cornhill Magazine as described in the text.\n- **Part A**: Identify two specific examples of how each magazine was indexed, including the start and end dates.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the indexing of these magazines reflects broader trends in periodical classification systems.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of the text''s mention of the 19th Century Guide adopting standard subject headings and cross references.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the specific examples from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how indexing practices influence periodical classification systems.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Poole''s Index Characteristics**\n\nExamine the structure and content of Poole''s Index as described in the text.\n- **Part A**: List three key contributors to Poole''s Index and their roles in its development.\n- **Part B**: Explain why Poole''s Index is described as a ''subject index only.'' Provide an example from the text to support your explanation.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the limitations of Poole''s Index in terms of author recognition, using the example of Thomas Babington Macaulay.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s description of Poole''s Index and its historical significance.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Periodical Classification**\n\nEvaluate the statement: ''The 19th Century Guide''s adoption of standard subject headings and cross references ensures greater consistency in periodical indexing.''\n- **Part A**: Use the text to support or challenge this statement. Provide two specific examples from the text that illustrate your reasoning.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the indexing methods of Poole''s Index with the 19th Century Guide, focusing on how each handles author and subject entries.\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument for why the distinction between subject indexing and author indexing is important in periodical classification systems.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s descriptions of both indexing systems and demonstrate an ability to synthesize information for a critical analysis.'

    Poole did not supply the date of the magazine in his references. A typical
    reference following the title of an article looks like this: Fortn 29:816. The
    Table of Abbreviations in the front of the volume shows that "Fortn" is the
    abbreviation for Fortnightly Review. The number before the colon is the
    volume number; the number after the colon is the first page of the article.
    By consulting the chronological conspectus at the front of the volume, the
    student would discover that volume 29 of the Fortnightly Review appeared
    in 1878. The chronological conspectus also indicates the volume numbers of
    the same date in other periodicals, so that from this table the student could
    trace the discussion of a subject in several contemporary periodicals.

    A paperbound volume, Poole's Index: Date and Volume Key, by Marion
    V. Bell and Jean C. Bacon (Chicago: Association of College and Reference
    Libraries, 1957), usually found on the shelves alongside Poole's Index, ar-
    ranges the 479 periodical titles in a single alphabetical listing, with the year
    supplied for each volume of each periodical.

    OTHER INDEXES

    Here is a list, with brief descriptions, of some other periodical indexes, which
    can usually be found on the reference shelves of public and college libraries.
    (All of them, except the Catholic Periodical Index, are published by the
    H. W. Wilson Company of New York):

    AGRICULTURAL INDEX (1916-to date)—Published monthly. Later published in
    bound volumes in annual and two-year cumulations. A subject index to
    anything connected with agriculture in periodicals, pamphlets, and bul-
    letins and in documents published by federal and state agricultural agencies.

    THE ART INDEX (1929-to date)—Published quarterly. Later cumulated in
    annual and two-year volumes. A subject and author index to periodicals
    and museum bulletins in the fields of archaeology, architecture, ceramics,
    ornament, engraving, graphic arts, landscaping, painting, sculpture.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding Periodical Indexes**\n\nGiven the descriptions of AGRICULTURAL INDEX and THE ART INDEX, explain how a researcher could use these indexes to trace the evolution of a topic over time.\n- **Step 1**: Identify which index is relevant to the topic of interest (e.g., AGRICULTURAL INDEX for agricultural topics).\n- **Step 2**: Determine the date range of the index (e.g., AGRICULTURAL INDEX is from 1916 to date).\n- **Step 3**: Use the chronological conspectus mentioned in the text to find the volume numbers of the same date in other periodicals, allowing the researcher to trace discussions across multiple sources.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must incorporate both the index description and the chronological conspectus information from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Reference Materials**\n\nExplain the purpose of Poole''s Index: Date and Volume Key, based on its description in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Note that this index arranges 479 periodical titles alphabetically with the year supplied for each volume.\n- **Step 2**: Infer how this arrangement helps researchers locate specific volumes of periodicals by date.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this to the chronological conspectus, which shows volume numbers of the same date in other periodicals.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of both the index''s structure and its utility in research.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning About Periodical Resources**\n\nThe text mentions that the Catholic Periodical Index is an exception, not published by H. W. Wilson Company. Explain how a researcher might determine which periodical indexes are published by H. W. Wilson Company without referring to the text.\n- **Step 1**: Recall that most indexes listed are published by H. W. Wilson Company.\n- **Step 2**: Use the fact that the Catholic Periodical Index is explicitly stated as an exception.\n- **Step 3**: Apply logical reasoning to infer that any index not named as an exception is likely published by H. W. Wilson Company.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must logically conclude that the majority of listed indexes are from H. W. Wilson Company, based on the given information.'

    THE Education Index (1929-to date)—Published monthly, except in June and August, with annual and two-year cumulations. A subject and author index to periodicals, books, monographs, bulletins, and reports on anything connected with education.

    Industrial Arts Index (1913-1957)—Published monthly. Later cumulated in annual bound volumes. This is a subject index only to periodical literature on business, finance, applied science, and technology. In 1958, this reference guide was divided into two separate publications: The Applied Science and Technology Index (covering aeronautics, automation, chemistry, construction, electrical communication, engineering, geology, metallurgy, physics, and transportation) and the Business Periodicals Index (covering accounting, insurance, public administration, taxation, and other allied subjects).

    Catholic Periodical Index (1930-to date)—Published quarterly by the Catholic Library Association of Washington, D.C., this periodical guide eventually appears in a bound volume with a two-year cumulation. It indexes about 200 Catholic periodicals published in various parts of the world, many of which are not included in the Readers' Guide or the International Index.

    Essay AND GENERAL LITERATURE INDEX (New York: H. W. Wilson Co., 1934- ).

    This is an author and subject index (with title entries where needed) to collections of essays, articles, and miscellaneous works of some reference value. The first five cumulative volumes cover the period from 1900 through 1959. Supplements appear semi-annually and annually, and eventually the cumulations appear in a bound volume that covers about a five-year period.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Periodical Index Characteristics**\n\nCompare and contrast the ''Industrial Arts Index'' and the ''Catholic Periodical Index'' based on their publication frequency, content scope, and indexing method.\n- **Part A**: Explain the difference in publication frequency between the two indexes and how this affects their cumulative coverage.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the content scope of each index, highlighting how the ''Industrial Arts Index'' covers applied sciences and technology while the ''Catholic Periodical Index'' focuses on religious publications.\n- **Part C**: Analyze the indexing methods described for both indexes, and explain how these methods affect their utility in research.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the specific details from the text about publication schedules, content focus, and indexing practices.\n'

How does this affect the availability of historical data for your research?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate all relevant details from the text about index characteristics and their historical relevance.'

- prompt: "The special value of the Essay and General Literature Index is that this  \nreference work can guide the student to collections that print essays, articles,  \nstories, poems, etc. which have been long out of print or which are not readily  \navailable in earlier editions or in bound periodicals. Sometimes the student  \nknows of or discovers through the periodical guides an essay or article that  \nwould be extremely useful for a paper he is writing, but in checking the  \nlibrary he learns to his dismay that this library does not have the book or the  \nbound periodical in which this piece originally appeared. He should not,  \nhowever, abandon all hope of getting a copy of this piece. The Essay and  \nGeneral Literature Index may indicate that it has been printed in a collection  \nor anthology, of which the library has a copy. At the back of each bound  \nvolume is a list of all the books indexed in that volume, and many librarians  \nput a check mark opposite the titles that the library has in the stacks. The  \nessays and articles reprinted in the \"readers\" that the student may have  \nbought for some of his college courses are, or will be, indexed in this refer-  \nence work.\n\nNew York Times Index (New York: New York Times Index, 1903— ).  \nTimes Literary Index (London: Times Office, 1906– ).\n\nSome public and university libraries keep a file of the local newspapers and  \nprovide some kind of index to these newspapers. They are more likely, how-  \never, to maintain files of some of the great newspapers, like the London  \nTimes and the New York Times, both of which publish annual indexes to  \ntheir copy.\n\nFormerly, libraries and newspaper \"morgues\" retained copies of the news-  \npapers, but these stacks were awkward to store, difficult to handle, and sus-  \nceptible to slow decay. Now, thanks to the microfilming process, an entire  \nyear's issue of a newspaper can be included on a few rolls of film. Using a  \nmicrofilm reader, the researcher can quickly turn to the particular issue and  \nfeature he is interested in and can take notes from the enlarged reproduction  \nof the newspaper type.\n\nObviously, an index to a newspaper can save the researcher hours of time.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Understanding the Role of Indexes in Library Research**\n\nUsing the information provided, explain how indexes like the Essay and General Literature Index assist researchers in locating essays or articles that are no longer readily available in bound periodicals.\n- **Step 1**: Define the purpose of an index as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how a researcher might use the Essay and General Literature Index to find a specific essay or article.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the text emphasizes that indexes can guide students to "collections that print essays, articles, stories, poems... which have been long out of print."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly articulate the function of indexes in library research and demonstrate understanding of how they help locate obscure or unavailable materials.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Comparing Newspaper Indexes and Microfilm**\n\nCompare the traditional method of storing newspapers (physical stacks) with the modern microfilm process, as described in the text.\n- **Part A**: Describe the disadvantages of maintaining physical newspaper stacks as outlined in the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain how microfilm solves these problems and what advantages it offers to researchers.\n- **Part C**: Analyze why the text mentions that libraries may maintain files of great newspapers like the London Times and New York Times, but not necessarily all local newspapers.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of both the historical and modern approaches to newspaper storage and their respective benefits.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Research Tools**\n\nThe text discusses how indexes can help locate articles that are no longer in print. Construct a logical argument explaining why a library would not have a particular article, even though it is available in an index.\n- **Part A**: Identify two possible reasons the library might not have the article, based on the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the Essay and General Literature Index can still be useful in this scenario.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to the claim that "All indexed articles are available in libraries." Your example must reference at least one index mentioned in the text and show how it aligns with the information provided.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s information about indexes and library collections to demonstrate reasoning about accessibility and indexing.

    The London Times is indexed from 1906 to the present in quarterly accumu-
    lations. The New York Times Index has been appearing since 1913 in quar-
    terly, monthly, or fortnightly issues. But each year these separate issues are
    cumulated and bound into a single volume that libraries retain on their ref-
    erence shelves.

    The New York Times Index is a subject index only. Articles and features
    are not entered by the titles or headlines they had in the newspaper. Instead,
    the compilers supply a phrase or sentence which concisely describes the sub-
    stance of the piece. For each entry under the subject heading, the date, page
    number, and column are given (for Sunday issues the section-number of the
    paper is also supplied)—e.g. Je 8, III, 3:4 (June 8—the year is supplied by
    the particular annual volume being used—section 3, page 3, column 4).

    If the student is tracing a news item that was covered over several days,
    he can, by turning the microfilm reader to earlier or later issues, find addi-
    tional material. The New York Times Index can also serve as an informal
    index to other newspapers, for major news events will most likely be cov-
    ered in local newspapers on the same date as they were covered in the New

    York Times.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Newspaper Indexing Systems**\n\nCompare and contrast the indexing systems described in the text for The London Times and The New York Times. Specifically, address the following:\n- **Part A**: Explain how the London Times is indexed in quarterly accumulations versus the New York Times Index, which includes monthly and fortnightly issues.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the function of the New York Times Index as a subject index, noting that articles are not entered by title but by a supplied phrase or sentence.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the utility of the New York Times Index as an informal index to other newspapers, considering how major news events are likely covered in local papers.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s descriptions and demonstrate understanding of how these indexing systems serve different research purposes.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Almanac Publications**\n\nThe text mentions two almanacs: the World Almanac and Book of Facts, and the Information Please Almanac. Analyze their publication histories and publishers:\n- **Part A**: Determine the earliest known publisher of the World Almanac and the current publisher.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the Information Please Almanac has changed publishers over time, citing at least two different publishers mentioned in the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument about why almanacs are still relevant today, referencing the continuity of publication and their role in providing factual information.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of the historical and current contexts of these publications as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Thinking on Newspaper Index Utility**\n\nThe text discusses the use of The New York Times Index for tracing news items across multiple days and its potential as an informal index to other newspapers.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the indexing system allows for the retrieval of additional material from earlier or later issues when tracking a news item.\n- **Part B**: Justify why major news events are likely to be covered in local newspapers on the same date as they appear in The New York Times.\n- **Part C**: Propose a scenario where the New York Times Index might not be sufficient for research, and explain why.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s descriptions of indexing systems and demonstrate critical thinking about their limitations and applications.'

    These almanacs are such rich storehouses of miscellaneous information that
    every student should buy one or the other. A large portion of each edition
    of the almanacs is reprinted every year without any changes, because certain
    kinds of data, like the names of the presidents and vice-presidents of the
    United States or the capitals of each state of the Union, are not subject to
    change. For that kind of information, a 1940 almanac is just as useful to the
    student as a 1962 almanac. Other kinds of information, however, do change
    from year to year. If the student is seeking statistics on the federal tax revenue
    for 1960, he must consult the almanac covering that year. The student should
    browse through one of these volumes in a bookstore to get an adequate
    notion of the great variety of useful information supplied.

    The Information Please Almanac contains more signed articles than does
    the World Almanac, and its coverage of foreign countries is more extensive.
    Because of the miscellaneous nature of the information, neither almanac ar-
    ranges its material in alphabetical order. Instead, extremely detailed indexes
    to the material in each volume are provided. Frequent cross-references point
    to additional material.

    Some of this information will be found in any one of the seven handbooks listed at the head of this article. But the student seeking information about an American author or an American novel would probably find the most complete information in one of the handbooks devoted exclusively to American literature. For anything connected with the theater, the articles in the Oxford Companion to the Theatre are likely to be fuller and more satisfactory than those in the other handbooks. The student should understand, however, that all of these handbooks supply only the essential facts; for studies in depth he will have to turn to other sources.

    Tue Reaver's Encyctopepia, ed. William Rose Benét (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co., 1948).

    Whereas the previously mentioned handbooks dealt with the literature and art of particular countries or a special art form, these two handbooks provide the same kinds of information about world literature and art. William Rose Benét's handbook covers the major world literatures—English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Greek, and Latin. Cassell's covers these literatures and, in addition, such minor ones as Armenian, Basque, Breton, Eskimo, Polynesian, Yiddish—cultures usually neglected by English-language reference works. In its two volumes of 2086 double-column pages, Cassell's treats of some eighty literatures. The articles in Cassell's are arranged alphabetically in three different sections:

    Part I Histories of the Literatures of the World and General Literary Subjects, pp. 1-574.

    Part II Biographies of Authors Who Died Before 1 August 1914.

    Part III Biographies of Authors Who Were Living on 1 August 1914 or Who Were Born after That Date.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Historical and Literary Context**\n\nUsing the information from Cassell''s Encyclopedia of World Literature, analyze how the historical context of an author''s life influences their literary works.\n- **Step 1**: Identify a specific example from the text where an author''s historical period is described in detail.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the cultural and political events of that time are reflected in their writing.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this with a literary work from a different historical period, using the text''s examples to support your argument.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both historical analysis and literary interpretation, referencing at least two examples from the text.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Biographical Information**\n\nUsing the structure of Cassell''s Encyclopedia (Parts I, II, and III), create a biographical profile for an author not mentioned in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Determine the author''s nationality, birth/death dates, and literary contributions.\n- **Step 2**: Place the author in one of Cassell''s three sections based on their lifespan.\n- **Step 3**: Provide a brief summary of the author''s works and their significance in world literature.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your profile must adhere to the format of Cassell''s Encyclopedia and correctly categorize the author according to the text''s structure.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Literary Classification**\n\nThe text discusses the coverage of major and minor literatures in Cassell''s Encyclopedia. Consider the classification system used in the text.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the text categorizes Armenian, Basque, and Yiddish literatures as ''minor'' while others like English or French are considered ''major''.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument about the implications of this classification system for global literary studies.\n- **Part C**: Propose a revised classification system that would include ''minor'' literatures in a different category. Justify your proposal using the text''s examples and reasoning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of literary classification systems and how they influence the study of world literature.'

    Part I contains about 550 articles ranging in length from two lines to the
    10,000 words it devotes to the Bible. In addition to long articles on such sub-
    jects as printing and publishing (35 columns), biography (12 columns), Eng-
    lish literature (26 columns), and Russian literature (12 columns), there are
    shorter articles on such topics as epigrams, rhetoric, alliterative verse, com-
    media dell'arte. Major articles and biographies are followed by brief bibli-
    ographies.

    While William Rose Benét's Reader's Encyclopedia is not as comprehen-
    sive and expansive as Cassell's, it is a handy one-volume source of essential
    information about world literature and the arts.

    This famous reference guide to poetry has been in existence now for over
    half a century. This latest edition has four kinds of indexes to poems collected
    in over 500 of the most important anthologies published through June 30,
    1960: (1) title index; (2) author index; (3) first-line index; (4) subject
    index. If the student can remember anything about the poem that he is trying
    to recover, he should be able to trace it with the aid of this reference guide.
    The subject index can also be used to find several poems dealing with a par-
    ticular topic. The student will have to resort to an index of quotations, like
    Bartlett's, if all he can remember of a poem is a line other than the first line.

    of interest in earlier music, this has been revised to include works from a
    later date.

    of knowledge about ancient music, especially about medieval plain-song, later
    editors included articles about the music of much earlier eras. An American
    Supplement, first added in the third edition, has been retained and amplified
    in the fourth and fifth. Approximately a half of the total contents of the fifth
    edition, some four million words, is new. Hundreds of expert contributors
    have written articles on such subjects as these: (1) definitions of musical
    terms; (2) explanations of the forms and methods of musical composition;
    (3) studies of the origin, development, and structure of musical instruments;
    (4) histories of various musical societies; (5) notices of composition, produc-
    tion, and contents of important works; (6) lists of the principal published
    collections of music; (7) biographies of composers, singers, players, patrons,
    etc.

    The Oxford Companion to Music makes no pretense of rivaling Grove's
    Dictionary, but the 1133 double-column pages in the 1955 edition provide a
    wealth of information about music and musicians. Throughout the text there
    are over I100 portraits and pictures, and at the back of the book there is a
    pronouncing glossary of some 7000 terms and names that appear in the
    articles.

    The Langer book is a reworking of the Epitome of History that the German professor Dr. Karl Ploetz prepared and that William H. Tillinghast trans-
    lated into English in 1883. In this revised edition, the coverage of this rich
    storehouse of historical facts has been brought down to the end of World
    War II in 1945. If the student has trouble locating the information he is
    seeking by following the geographical and chronological indicators at the
    top of each page, he can consult the highly detailed index. The historical
    narrative is interspersed with many black-and-white maps and almost a hun-
    dred genealogical tables of the major ruling families, and the Appendix pro-
    vides lists of the Roman and Byzantine emperors, the popes, and the British,
    French, and Italian ministries.

    The Morris book is a comparable handbook for American history. It has
    three main divisions: Part I, chronologically arranged, which presents major
    political and military events of the nation from the pre-Columbian era to
    the inauguration of President John F. Kennedy in January 1961; Part II,
    topically organized, which presents such non-political aspects of American
    history as constitutional developments, westward expansion, and economic,
    scientific, and cultural trends; Part III, alphabetically arranged, which pre-
    sents brief biographical sketches of some 400 notable Americans. Scattered
    throughout the more than 800 double-column pages of the text are charts,
    tables, and historical maps. An extremely detailed Index serves as a key to
    the wealth of information in this handbook.

    DICTIONARIES, ATLASES, AND GAZETTEERS

    A good desk dictionary, like Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary, the New
    World Dictionary, the American College Dictionary, or Funk and Wagnalls'
    Standard College Dictionary, will supply the routine information that a stu-
    dent seeks about the spelling, syllabification, pronunciation, and meaning of
    words, as well as providing some brief information about many proper
    names. Occasionally, however, a student may have to consult unabridged
    and other special dictionaries, and therefore he should become familiar with
    the special dictionaries that are usually available on the reference shelves of
    libraries.

    Onions, 10 vols. and supplement (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1884-
    1928). Supplement, 1933.

    The greatest dictionary of the English language—in fact, the greatest diction-
    ary ever compelled for any language—is the New English Dictionary (NED)
    or, as it has been referred to since about 1895, the Oxford English Dictionary
    (OED). The idea for this comprehensive dictionary originated in a sugges-
    tion that Richard Chevenix Trench, then Dean of Westminster, made to the
    Philological Society of England in 1857. It was decided right from the start
    that this dictionary would provide a historical study of the language, and
    several hundred readers were engaged to select and transcribe quotations
    which would be the basis of the historical conspectus. Some 1300 additional
    readers, most of them non-professional students of the language, culled three
    and a half million quotation slips from more than 5000 authors of all periods.

    The first volume of the OED was published in 1884; the tenth volume
    was published in 1928—forty-four years after the first volume appeared and
    seventy years after the Philological Society passed the resolution to publish
    the dictionary. In 1933 a 336-page supplement was published to cover the
    recent additions to the language (either new words or new senses) and some
    words that had been overlooked in the main dictionary. The ten volumes of
    "the Principal Dictionary" have a total of 15,487 pages with 1,827,306 illus-
    trative quotations.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Historical Development of the Oxford English Dictionary**\n\nAnalyze the timeline and scale of the OED''s creation. Given that the first volume was published in 1884 and the tenth in 1928, calculate how many years it took to complete the entire dictionary. Additionally, determine how many millions of words were averaged per volume based on the 3.5 million quotation slips from over 5000 authors.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include mathematical calculations and an explanation of the significance of these figures in understanding the OED''s historical context.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Dictionary Compilation Methods**\n\nExamine the process described in the text for selecting quotations. If 3.5 million quotation slips were collected from over 5000 authors, how many slips did each author contribute on average? Furthermore, considering that the OED required 1300 readers to transcribe quotations, what is the ratio of transcription tasks to quotation collection tasks?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of ratios and averages, using the numbers provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Dictionary History and Purpose**\n\nThe text states that the OED was originally conceived as a historical study of the English language. Given that the first volume appeared in 1884 and the supplement in 1933, how many years passed between the publication of the first volume and the supplement? Additionally, explain why this timeline is significant in terms of the dictionary''s role as a historical record.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must connect the timeline to the dictionary''s purpose and demonstrate an understanding of its historical value.'

    In the preface to the first volume, the editors stated, "The aim of this Dictionary is to furnish an adequate account of the meaning, origin, and history of English words now in general use, or known to have been in use at any time during the last seven hundred years." In accordance with this objective, the OED supplies (1) the variant spellings a word has had down through the years; (2) the etymology of the word, established by the methods of modern philological science; (3) the pronunciation of the word (usually the pronunciation that prevailed at the time that particular volume was published); (4) the various meanings a word has had; (5) quotations illustrating the spellings and meanings, ranging from the first known occurrence of the word in printed works to the recent occurrences of the word in modern texts. Each illustrative quotation is preceded by the date of the occurrence, the name of the author, a short-title reference to the source, and the page number in the source. It should be emphasized that the earliest date supplied is not necessarily the date when the word was first used; this date indicates the earliest discovered written record of the use of the word.

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Dictionary Principles**\n\nThe text mentions that the earliest date supplied in a dictionary entry is not necessarily the date when a word was first used. Using this information, construct an argument for why dictionary compilers might choose to omit the earliest known use of a word.\n- **Part A**: Identify two possible reasons for omitting the earliest known use of a word.\n- **Part B**: Explain how this practice affects the accuracy and utility of the dictionary as a historical record.\n- **Part C**: Propose a method for a compiler to balance the need for accuracy with the practicality of including only the earliest discovered written record.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate logical reasoning about historical record-keeping and demonstrate an understanding of the limitations and purposes of dictionary compilation.'

    William A. Craigie, one of the editors of the OED, worked with Professor James R. Hulbert of the University of Chicago to produce a historical dictionary of American English. As the editors said in their preface, this dictionary would include "not only words and phrases which are clearly or apparently of American origin or have greater currency here than elsewhere, but also every word denoting something which has a real connection with the development of the country and the history of its people." Using the historical principle that informed the OED and supplying the same kind of information, Craigie and Hulbert aimed to show how American English was distinguished from the languages of England and other English-speaking countries. The short-title references used in the citations are expanded in the 23-page bibliography. The end of the nineteenth century was arbitrarily chosen as the cut-off point for the admission of words to the lexicon, but many of the illustrative quotations are taken from works published during the first twenty-five years of the twentieth century.

    164 | DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    In January of 1944, the year in which the last volume of the DAE was published, Mitford M. Mathews and his staff began preparation for A Dictionary of Americanisms (abbreviated DA). The DA would seem to be superfluous, but Professor Mathews felt that the DAE had marked as Americanisms many terms which he had reasons to reject and that the DAE had omitted some terms that were clearly Americanisms. The narrower scope of the DA is due to Mathews' definition of "Americanism": "a word or expression that originated in the United States." This criterion admitted into the word-list "outright coinages," as appendicitis, hydrant, tularemia; such words as adobe, campus, gorilla, which first became English in the United States; and terms such as faculty, fraternity, refrigerator, when used in senses first given them in American usage." A 33-page bibliography gives the full titles of works cited in the illustrative quotations.

    For many kinds of historical, cultural, and linguistic information about Americanisms, the student should consult one of these two dictionaries.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Historical Dictionary Principles**\n\nUsing the principles described in the text for the OED and the DA, explain how the distinction between ''Americanisms'' and ''words with real connection to American development'' shapes the scope of these dictionaries.\n- **Step 1**: Define ''Americanisms'' according to Mathews'' criteria.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast this with the OED''s broader inclusion of words ''with real connection to the development of the country.''\n- **Step 3**: Justify why Mathews'' narrower focus on ''originated in the United States'' makes the DA more specialized than the OED.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference both dictionaries'' definitions and demonstrate an understanding of how their differing criteria affect their scope.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Historical Context to Dictionary Compilation**\n\nThe text states that the DA was published in 1944, five years after the DAE. Based on this information, explain how the timeline of publication affects the dictionaries'' inclusion criteria and their roles in documenting American English.\n- **Part A**: Discuss how the 23-page bibliography for the OED and the 33-page bibliography for the DA reflect their respective focus on historical sources.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the end of the nineteenth century was chosen as a cut-off point for the OED but not for the DA.\n- **Part C**: Analyze how the publication dates influence the way each dictionary approaches its mission to document American English.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the timeline information with the text''s discussion of each dictionary''s purpose and methodology.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Dictionary Scope and Purpose**\n\nThe text mentions that the DA includes ''outright coinages'' like appendicitis and hydrant, while the OED includes words with ''real connection to the development of the country.'' Using this information, construct an argument about whether a dictionary should prioritize originality or historical significance in its entries.\n- **Part A**: Define the criteria for ''originality'' and ''historical significance'' as presented in the text.\n- **Part B**: Compare the DA''s inclusion of coinages with the OED''s broader scope.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate which criterion (originality or historical significance) better serves the purpose of documenting a language''s development.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be based solely on the information provided in the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of both dictionaries'' approaches.'

    The Century Dictionary and Cyclopaedia, ed. William Dwight Whitney and Benjamin E. Smith, 12 vols. (New York: The Century Company, 1889-1914).

    The Century Dictionary is generally regarded as the best multi-volume unabridged dictionary ever produced by a commercial publisher in America. Under the general editorship of William Dwight Whitney, the first edition appeared between 1889 and 1891. A cyclopedia of names appeared in 1894, an atlas in 1897, and two supplementary volumes in 1909. The final edition in 1914 was produced in a 12-volume set. The total number of words and names in the completed work was more than 500,000. Since about 1920, this great dictionary, which typographically is the most attractive and readable dictionary ever produced, has been out of print. Most college libraries, however, have a set on the reference shelves, and occasionally one can find a set in a secondhand bookstore.

    This dictionary was designed to be as complete a record of literary English as possible. One of its values for the student of literature is the generous coverage given to obsolete words and forms, such as the Middle English of Chaucer's time. Moreover, the words and idioms of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century literature are more adequately covered than in any other American dictionary. The Century Dictionary gives illustrative quotations, presents full and accurate etymological information, lists synonyms for about 7000 words, and for many of the words adds a short informative essay.

    The sub-title of the Cyclopedia of Names reveals the scope of this volume: A Pronouncing and Etymological Dictionary of Names in Geography, Biography, Mythology, History, Ethnology, Art, Archaeology, Fiction, Etc. This valuable dictionary of proper names has been made available in a separate publication: The New Century Cyclopedia of Names, in 3 vols. (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1954).

    Most college students at one time or another have consulted the second edition of this unabridged dictionary, which was published in 1934. From now on, they will be consulting the third edition. The second was advertised as containing 600,000 entries, including the proper names in its biographical and gazetteer sections. The third edition is advertised as containing among its 450,000 entries 100,000 new words or meanings. Although the third edition has dropped the biographical and gazetteer sections, the Merriam-Webster Company publishes them as separate, portable dictionaries.

    166 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    Webster's Third New International Dictionary is the most complete, up-to-date record of American English now in existence. It covers the thousands of technical terms that have inundated the language in the last twenty-five years as well as the slang and colloquial idioms that have been added to the language. Most of the entries are illustrated by quotations, many of them from contemporary prose.

    Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English,

    ed. Eric Partridge (New York: Macmillan, 1958).

    Among the useful dictionaries compiled by Eric Partridge are A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English (now in its fifth edition), A Dictionary of the Underworld, British and American, and Shakespeare's Bawdy: A Study and a Glossary. For anyone who delights in the study of words, Origins is the most fascinating of Partridge's dictionaries.

    Unlike the other dictionaries that we have looked at in this section, Origins does not give the pronunciation or meanings of words. It confines itself to the etymology of some 12,000 of the commonest words in modern English. But the 15-page section on prefixes, the 22-page section on suffixes, and the 100-page section on compound-forming elements will help the student with thousands of learned and technical words in the language. The medical student, for instance, who detects some form of the element glosso- (from the Greek word meaning "tongue") can guess at the meaning of words like glossograph, glossology, glossotomy, glottiscope, glottogenic.

Use specific examples from the text about each dictionary''s content and purpose.\n- **Part B**: Based on the description of *Origins*, create a list of three words that include the prefix ''glosso-'' and explain their possible meanings using the etymology provided.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the approaches of the two dictionaries in handling word origins, emphasizing how their combined use enhances understanding of language evolution.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate knowledge from both dictionaries and demonstrate an understanding of their distinct yet complementary roles in linguistic analysis.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Dictionary Entries**\n\nUsing the information from Merriam-Webster''s Third New International Dictionary, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: Explain why the third edition of the dictionary has removed the biographical and gazetteer sections, but still publishes them as separate dictionaries. Use the text''s description of the third edition''s content to justify this decision.\n- **Part B**: Provide two examples of technical terms covered in the dictionary that reflect modern language changes, and explain how these terms illustrate the dictionary''s purpose of documenting ''the thousands of technical terms that have inundated the language in the last twenty-five years.''\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the inclusion of quotations from contemporary prose in the dictionary supports its claim to be ''the most complete, up-to-date record of American English now in existence.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text''s descriptions of Merriam-Webster''s dictionary and demonstrate an understanding of its role in documenting modern language usage.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Etymological Knowledge**\n\nUsing the information from *Origins* by Eric Partridge, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: Construct a hypothetical word that includes the suffix ''-ology'' and explain its likely meaning based on the text''s discussion of suffixes.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the study of compound-forming elements, as described in *Origins*, helps in understanding the structure and meaning of technical terms like ''glossotomy'' or ''glottogenic.''\n- **Part C**: Create a list of three modern slang terms that might be documented in *Origins* and explain how their inclusion would reflect the dictionary''s focus on ''the study of words'' and ''language evolution.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate creative application of etymological principles and show an understanding of how these concepts apply to both historical and modern linguistic phenomena.'

    BIBLIOGRAPHIES

    A bibliography is a list of books and articles on a certain subject or author. A bibliography of an author lists works by that author and/or works about him. Each field of study has standard reference works directing the student to the published material in that discipline, and as the student progresses in his field of specialization, he will become familiar with the standard bibliographical guides in his specialized study. Here we will treat of two general guides to bibliographies in all fields and then of the principal bibliographical guides for English and American literature.

    A World Bibliography of Bibliographies, ed. Theodore Besterman, 3d ed., 4 vols. (Geneva, 1955-56).

    This reference work, which was first published privately by its editor in 1939-40, is the most notable of the English-language bibliographies of bibliographies. The phrase "bibliography of bibliographies" may sound like double

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Bibliographical Concepts\n\nCompare and contrast the definitions of a bibliography provided in the text with the concept of a ''bibliography of bibliographies'' as described in the same passage.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key elements of a standard bibliography as defined in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Explain the unique purpose of a ''bibliography of bibliographies'' using the text''s description.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the phrase ''bibliography of bibliographies'' is considered redundant or meaningful based on the text''s explanation.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate between standard bibliographies and ''bibliographies of bibliographies'' using definitions provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Application of Bibliographical Logic\n\nUsing the information provided, construct a logical argument for why the text considers ''A World Bibliography of Bibliographies'' to be a significant reference work in English-language bibliographical studies.\n- **Step 1**: Reference the text''s claim about the work being ''the most notable of the English-language bibliographies of bibliographies''.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how this work serves as a guide for students and scholars in their research process.\n- **Step 3**: Connect this to the broader purpose of bibliographies in academic study as described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the role and significance of bibliographies in academic research based on the text provided.'

    Talk, but it is simply the term for a reference work that provides all the
    publication information about printed bibliographies on a variety of subjects.
    Someone assigned to do a term paper on witchcraft might want to discover
    whether a bibliography has ever been compiled on this subject. Besterman's
    work would not list the titles of works on witchcraft; it would simply give
    the titles of any bibliographies that had been compiled of such works. If the
    library had copies of those bibliographies, then the student would be able
    to assemble a list of books and articles pertinent to the subject he has been
    assigned to write on. Besterman's work would be a logical starting place for
    anyone launching upon a major piece of research.

    As the title suggests, Besterman's work is international in its scope. It
    covers bibliographies in the humanities, the sciences, and technology, but it
    is limited to separately published bibliographies—that is, to books, mono-
    graphs, or pamphlets which are devoted exclusively or primarily to bibli-
    ography. Hence the bibliographies given at the end of chapters or at the back
    of a book would not be listed in Besterman.

    The bibliographies are arranged alphabetically according to subjects. An
    author index refers the student to the volume and pages of this work where
    a particular author's bibliography is listed. Since the searcher for a bibliog-
    raphy does not usually know the name of the compiler, he will probably have
    to consult the subject index. Frequent cross-references direct the student to

    bibliographies on allied subjects.

    The Cumulative Book Index (New York: H. W. Wilson, 1933-
    to date).

    Published every month except August, the Cumulative Book Index is an
    author, title, and subject catalogue of new books published in English in all
    countries of the world. These monthly issues are cumulated (at irregular
    intervals) and published in huge bound volumes, which are usually kept in
    the librarian's workroom but are available to the student for consultation.

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Bibliographic Research Process\n\nUsing the information provided in the text, outline a step-by-step approach for a student researching witchcraft literature.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the appropriate reference work to begin with.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how Besterman''s work can help in locating relevant bibliographies.\n- **Step 3**: Describe the process of using subject and author indexes to find specific bibliographies.\n- **Step 4**: Justify why cross-references are important in the research process.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate all key components of the text and demonstrate an understanding of the role of bibliographies in research.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Comparative Analysis of Bibliographic Resources\n\nCompare and contrast Besterman''s work with the Cumulative Book Index as tools for research.\n- **Part A**: Explain the scope and limitations of each resource.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how each is used in the research process (e.g., Besterman for finding bibliographies, Cumulative Book Index for cataloging new books).\n- **Part C**: Analyze the utility of each resource for a researcher working on witchcraft literature.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the specific functions and purposes of both resources as described in the text.'

    Every published book is catalogued at least three times in a single alphabetical listing: once under the author's last name; once under the first significant word in the title; and at least once under a subject heading (there are frequent cross-references to other subject headings). The author entry supplies the fullest information about a book: (1) full name of the author (including pseudonym, if any); (2) complete title of the book; (3) name of publisher (or source from which the book may be obtained); (4) date of publication; (5) paging; (6) price of the book; (7) the Library of Congress catalogue card number.

    The student can use the Cumulative Book Index as a bibliographical aid by consulting the subject headings. If he were doing a paper, for instance, on "Linguistics in the Curriculum," he could, by consulting the subject heading "Linguistics" or some sub-division of that heading in all the published volumes of the Cumulative Book Index, collect a complete bibliography of all the English-language books published on linguistics since 1928. From that complete list, he would then have to select the books that had a special pertinence to the subject of his paper.

    The CBEL is commonly acknowledged to be the standard bibliography of English language and literature. It is a descendant of the 15-volume Cambridge History of English Literature, ed. A. W. Ward and A. R. Waller, 1907-16, which included a selected bibliography at the end of each chapter.

    The province of the CBEL is all writings (whether in English or in Latin) of literary interest by natives of what is now the British Commonwealth up to the year 1900. Although no English writer who achieved prominence after 1900 is included, critical articles published as late as 1940 are admitted. Volume V, the supplement, records the more scholarly publications that appeared between 1940 and the beginning of 1955.

    The CBEL is arranged chronologically rather than alphabetically. The quickest way for a student to locate the bibliography for an author or subject is to consult Volume IV, the index. Consulting the index under "Boswell," the student would find this kind of entry:

    Boswell, James (1740-1795), II, 55, 92, 650f, 903.

    Printed in bold type, the 650f indicates the main bibliographical entry in Volume II for the biographer of Samuel Johnson. The other numbers direct the student to pages in Volume II where other scholarly works pertinent to Boswell are listed. The general introduction in Volume I includes bibliographies on a number of subjects that could not be conveniently distributed among the various periods—e.g. bibliographies, histories, prosody, anthologies.

    In the author entries, the works of an author are listed first, then the works about an author. The former listing follows this arrangement: (1) bibliographies and concordances (if any) published about the author; (2) the works of the author, published separately or in collections during his lifetime; (3) the modern editions of the author's works. Under the works about an author are listed biographical and critical studies of the author beginning with his contemporaries.

    Whereas the bibliographies in the CBEL are disposed chronologically, the
    207 American authors covered in the third volume of the LHUS are arranged
    alphabetically. Because of this arrangement, the student does not have to
    consult the index at the back of the volume in order to locate the bibliog-
    raphies of individual authors, but he can consult the index for page numbers
    in the first two volumes where the author is discussed and for page numbers
    for bibliographies and studies of subjects. The bibliographies for authors
    include editions and studies published by the end of 1946 (a few 1947 publi-
    cations are included). The author entries include notices of bibliographies,
    concordances, separate and collected works, edited texts and reprints, biog-
    raphy and criticism, and location of important manuscript copies.

    Any bibliography begins to date as soon as it is published. It continues to be
    useful, of course, as a record of the books and articles published during the
    period that it covers, but the record necessarily stops shortly before the date
    of publication. Several of the literary journals keep the scholar informed
    about all the important work that has been done on language and literature
    during the previous year. The most comprehensive annual bibliography of
    literature is that published every spring in a special supplement of PMLA.
    This bibliography covers all periods of the major Western languages—Eng-
    lish, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Scandinavian, Dutch,
    and about ten East European languages. Some of the other literary journals
    publish annual bibliographies of a specific period: Medieval Period—Specu-
    lum; Renaissance—Studies in Philology; Restoration and Eighteenth Cen-
    tury—Philological Quarterly (July issue); Romantic Period—Phzilological
    Quarterly (April issue) ; Victorian Period—Victorian Studies; Modern Period
    —Twentieth-Century Literature; American Literature (all periods)—Amer-
    ican Literature.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing the Purpose of Bibliographies**\n\nThe text discusses the role and purpose of bibliographies in academic scholarship. Analyze the function of annual bibliographies as described in the passage:\n- **Part A**: Explain why a bibliography is said to "begin to date as soon as it is published." Use logical reasoning based on the text''s explanation of its purpose.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the "comprehensive annual bibliography" of PMLA with the specialized bibliographies of literary journals. How does each serve a different purpose in academic research?\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the implications of the text''s statement that "bibliographies continue to be useful as a record of the books and articles published during the period that it covers." How does this affect the way scholars use bibliographies in their research?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s definitions and demonstrate an understanding of how bibliographies serve as academic resources.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Interpreting the Syntopicon''s Role in Education**\n\nThe text references *The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon of Great Books of the Western World* as an example of a syntopicon. Analyze the function and significance of a syntopicon in academic education:\n- **Part A**: Based on the text, explain what a syntopicon is and its purpose in compiling literature.\n- **Part B**: Compare the *Great Ideas* syntopicon to other literary journals'' annual bibliographies. How do they differ in scope and function?\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument for why a syntopicon like *The Great Ideas* is essential in modern academic curricula, using the text''s description of its role in education.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s description of syntopicons and their relevance to scholarly work.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Reasoning About the Structure of Literary Journals**\n\nThe text describes a variety of literary journals that publish annual bibliographies covering specific historical periods. Analyze the structure and purpose of these specialized bibliographies:\n- **Part A**: Explain how the different literary journals (e.g., *Speculum*, *Studies in Philology*, *Victorian Studies*) are organized based on their focus periods.\n- **Part B**: Evaluate the significance of having separate bibliographies for different historical periods (e.g., Medieval, Renaissance, Modern). How does this aid scholars in their research?\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument that explains why the text mentions *The Great Ideas* syntopicon alongside these specialized bibliographies. How do they complement each other in academic research?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s details about literary journals and their role in academic scholarship.  '

    The Syntopicon, Volumes 2 and 3 of the 54-volume set of The Great Books
    of the Western World, is such a unique and valuable reference work that it
    merits a fuller exposition than we gave the other reference works. The term
    syntopicon is a coinage signifying "collection of topics." As a collection of
    topics, the Syntopicon is a reference resource that the ancient rhetoricians
    might have wished were available in their time as a guide to the relatively
    more specialized knowledge that a speaker or writer needs when he has to
    develop a particular subject. Mortimer J. Adler said of this mammoth index
    that it is "the exact reverse of the giant comptometers which are fed data
    and do the thinking for the people; the Syntopicon feeds people the data—
    the issues and the various positions taken on them—and lets the human mind
    do its own thinking."

    Some 443 works of seventy-four authors are printed in Volumes 4 to 54
    of the Great Books, and Professor Adler had to decide on a basic list of
    great ideas which would serve as a detailed index to the topics discussed
    in the selected "great books" and in the Bible, the text of which is not
    presented in the set. Professor Adler pared his list of great ideas down to a
    manageable one hundred and two, including such topics as aristocracy,
    beauty, democracy, evolution, fate, good and evil, love, nature, pleasure and
    pain, rhetoric, sign and symbol, time, wealth. A staff of indexers launched
    upon a series of readings of the Great Books to gather references to discus-
    sions of these ideas by the great authors. Eventually, the basic ideas were
    subdivided into 3000 topics.

    Each of the 102 chapters of the Syntopicon consists of five parts:

    J. Introduction. This is an essay summarizing the history of the discus-
    sion of the idea treated in that chapter. The various interpretations of
    the idea are reviewed, and the problems and controversies raised by
    the continual "conversation" about the idea are discussed.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Syntopicon''s Purpose and Structure**\n\nGiven the description of the Syntopicon as a "collection of topics" and its role in indexing great ideas from the Great Books, analyze how it differs from traditional reference works like the Bible or encyclopedias.\n- **Step 1**: Define what makes the Syntopicon unique in its approach to organizing knowledge.\n- **Step 2**: Compare and contrast it with the Bible or encyclopedias in terms of structure, purpose, and content.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the Syntopicon is described as "the exact reverse of the giant comptometers" in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly connect the Syntopicon''s "conversation" model with its role as a guide for speakers and writers, using the text''s definition of a syntopicon as "collection of topics."  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Great Ideas Indexing**\n\nUsing the 102 basic ideas and their subdivision into 3000 topics from the Syntopicon, construct an argument for why this indexing system is essential for understanding complex texts like the Great Books.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the Syntopicon''s hierarchical structure (ideas -> topics) mirrors the complexity of philosophical discourse.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example from the text (e.g., "aristocracy," "rhetoric") to demonstrate how the Syntopicon helps locate discussions of a particular idea within the Great Books.\n- **Part C**: Argue that this system allows for a more nuanced analysis of texts than traditional encyclopedias, using the text''s description of the Syntopicon as "a guide to the relatively more specialized knowledge" needed for developing a subject.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the Syntopicon''s role in "feeding people the data" and connecting it to the purpose of the Great Books.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Syntopicon''s Structure**\n\nThe text describes the Syntopicon as consisting of 102 chapters, each with five parts. Consider how this structure might inform the organization of a modern reference work.\n- **Part A**: Analyze how the "introduction" section of each chapter (as described in the text) functions as a framework for understanding the topic.\n- **Part B**: Compare the Syntopicon''s structure to a modern encyclopedia or database, using examples from the text (e.g., "fate," "time") to illustrate how this structure facilitates efficient information retrieval.\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument for why the Syntopicon''s "conversation" model is more effective than traditional indexing systems in fostering critical thinking. Use the text''s description of the Syntopicon as "a guide to the relatively more specialized knowledge" needed for developing a subject.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly connect the Syntopicon''s structure to its role as a "collection of topics" and its purpose in helping "the human mind do its own thinking."

    II. Outline of the Topics. This section sets forth in outline form the major
    themes of the discussion about the idea. Although there is an average
    of thirty topics to each chapter, the actual number varies from as few
    as six topics in a chapter to as many as seventy-six.

    III. References. This section, arranged topically, is the heart of the Syn-
    topicon. Under each topic the exact location is indicated of all passages
    in the Great Books set related to that topic. Here is a typical entry:

    35 Locke Human Understanding Bk. II, ch. xxi, 178a-200d

    The inquirer is here referred to Volume 35 of the Great Books set,
    where John Locke's Essay on Human Understanding is reprinted in
    its entirety. The "Bk. II, ch. xxi" is a reference to the author's division
    of his treatise, which also enables the inquirer to find the relevant
    passage in some other edition of the author's work. The "178a-200d"
    cites the first and last page, together with page section, of the relevant
    passage in Volume 35. The order in which the references are arranged
    enables the inquirer to pursue the discussion of some theme in a his-
    torical sequence or in a select group of authors or in a particular
    period. References to the Bible, if any, are always listed first.

    IV. Cross-References. This section directs the inquirer to other chapters
    in the Syntopicon where similar or related topics are treated. In addi-
    tion to directing the inquirer to allied material, the cross-references
    make him aware of the interrelationships among the great ideas.

    V. Additional Readings. This section refers the reader to other works not
    reprinted in the Great Books set. These bibliographies are divided
    into two sections: (1) works written by authors represented in Vol-
    umes 4-54 of Great Books of the Western World; (2) works by
    authors not included in the Great Books set. In this section, the
    additional readings are listed only by author and title, but in the
    Bibliography of Additional Readings at the back of the second vol-
    ume of the Syntopicon, the full bibliographical information about each
    work is supplied.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Themes**\n\nFrom the outline provided in the text, identify and explain three major rhetorical themes discussed in the Syntopicon. For each theme, provide an example of a referenced text (e.g., Locke Human Understanding) and explain how it contributes to the overall discussion of classical rhetoric in modern contexts.\n- **Answer Requirement**: Your response must include at least three distinct themes, each with a corresponding reference from the text and an explanation of its relevance to the study of rhetoric.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Cross-Referential Analysis**\n\nUsing the cross-reference section of the text, explain how the discussion of ''human understanding'' in Locke''s *Essay on Human Understanding* (Bk. II, ch. xxi) relates to other topics in the Syntopicon. Specifically, identify two other chapters or texts that are cross-referenced with this passage and explain the logical connections between them.\n- **Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of how cross-references interrelate different themes and highlight the significance of these connections in the context of classical rhetoric.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Additional Readings**\n\nCompare and contrast the role of additional readings in the Syntopicon with the role of the main references. Using examples from both sections, explain how these readings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of classical rhetoric in modern education.\n- **Answer Requirement**: Your response must analyze the purpose and function of both types of readings, providing specific examples from the text to support your argument.  '

- prompt: |-
    Another valuable reference feature of the Syntopicon is the inventory of terms. This section serves as a kind of table of contents for the Syntopicon. Mortimer Adler remarks about this section in his introduction: "The person who wishes to use the Syntopicon as a reference book, in order to learn what the great books have to say on a particular subject, must be able to find that subject among the 3000 topics. The primary function of the Inventory of Terms is to enable him to find the topic or topics which either clearly express or approximately represent the subject of his inquiry."

    EXTERNAL AIDS TO INVENTION 173

    For example, one of the terms that is likely to be involved in a discussion of Rhetoric is persuasion. Consulting the term persuasion in the inventory of terms, the inquirer would find this notation:

    Persuasion: see RHETORIC, 1-5/b see also DIALECTIC 5; EMOTION 5d; INDUCTION 4b; LANGUAGE 8; OPINION 2c; PLEASURE AND PAIN rob; REASONING sd.

    The terms printed in block-capitals refer the inquirer to one of the 102 alphabetically arranged chapters in the Syntopicon; the numbers and lowercase letters refer the inquirer to the particular sub-division of the references section of that chapter. This section will in turn direct the inquirer to the passages in the Great Books where the term persuasion is a major term of the discussion.

    No exposition can adequately convey an idea of the wealth of information to be found in the pages of this unique reference work or make entirely clear how it works. The student should browse through it to discover for himself the nature, scope, and method of this valuable guide to the wisdom of the ages.

    EXERCISE

    Since no amount of lecturing will do as much to acquaint students with reference works as will consulting the works to find answers to specific questions, this exercise is designed to get students to use the reference works discussed in the section on external aids to invention.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Navigating the Inventory of Terms in the Syntopicon**\n\nUsing the example of the term ''persuasion'' provided in the text, explain how one would locate information about persuasion in the Syntopicon''s Inventory of Terms.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the primary reference in the inventory (e.g., ''RHETORIC, 1-5/b'').\n- **Step 2**: Interpret the sub-divisions (e.g., ''1-5/b'' refers to a specific section in the RHETORIC chapter).\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this leads to locating relevant passages in the Great Books.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how the Inventory of Terms functions as a reference tool and explicitly connect it to the example given in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Reference Work Usage**\n\nDesign a hypothetical question that a student might pose to the Syntopicon, and outline the steps one would take to find the answer using the Inventory of Terms.\n- **Step 1**: Choose a topic (e.g., ''the role of emotion in argumentation'').\n- **Step 2**: Consult the Inventory of Terms to find relevant entries.\n- **Step 3**: Trace the references to specific chapters and sub-divisions to locate relevant Great Books passages.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your question must be specific enough to require the use of the Inventory, and your steps must demonstrate a clear understanding of how the reference system works.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Reference Work Structure**\n\nCompare and contrast the structure of the Inventory of Terms with a traditional table of contents. Explain how the Syntopicon''s inventory enables more precise navigation of its content compared to a conventional table of contents.\n- **Part A**: Describe the purpose of the Inventory of Terms in the Syntopicon.\n- **Part B**: Explain how it differs from a traditional table of contents in terms of organization and function.\n- **Part C**: Justify why this structure is advantageous for a reference work like the Syntopicon.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate an understanding of both the Syntopicon''s structure and traditional reference tools, demonstrating a critical analysis of their respective functions.'

- prompt: "The answers to a few of the following questions could be found in one  \nof the standard encyclopedias, the card catalogue in the library, or a desk  \ndictionary. In every case, the student should consult the reference work  \nwhere he is most likely to find the information. For instance, if the student  \nwanted the date of publication of the novel *Vanity Fair*, he might find this  \ninformation in a handbook of world literature, like William Rose Benét's  \n*The Reader's Encyclopedia*; but since William Makepeace Thackeray, the  \nauthor of *Vanity Fair*, is an English novelist, it is more likely that the student  \nwill find this information in a handbook devoted exclusively to English  \nliterature, like the *Oxford Companion to English Literature* or *The New  \nCentury Handbook of English Literature*.\n\nIn doing this exercise, the student should (1) write out the problem as it  \nis stated below; (2) write out the answer to the problem (sometimes this  \nwill involve copying the answer as it appears in the reference work; in this  \ncase it should be copied exactly and put in quotation marks); (3) designate  \nthe source of the information—title of the reference work (underlined),  \nedition of the work (if the work consulted is an edition later than the first—  \ne.g. revised, second, etc.), the volume number (only in the case of a multi-  \nvolume reference work), the exact page number on which the answer was  \nfound. The following is a format that the student might observe in doing  \nthis exercise:\n\nProblem: Who established the American string quartet known as the  \nFlonzaley Quartet?\n\nAnswer: Edward J. De Coppet of New York City established the Flonzaley  \nQuartet.\n\nSource: *Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians*, 3d ed., II, 254.\n\nYou Want to Find:\n\n1.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Historical Event and Title of a Book**\n\n**Problem**: When did Sir Robert Peel, the man responsible for the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1842, become Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow?\n\n**Answer**: Sir Robert Peel became Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow in 1834.\n\n**Source**: *Grove''s Dictionary of Music and Musicians*, 3d ed., II, 254.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must be specific to the year and explicitly reference the source as indicated, without any additional information.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Character in a Novel**\n\n**Problem**: In which of Frank Norris''s novels does the character Curtis Jadwin appear?\n\n**Answer**: "Curtis Jadwin is a character in Frank Norris''s novel *The Octave*."\n\n**Source**: *Grove''s Dictionary of Music and Musicians*, 3d ed., II, 254.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include the exact novel title and reference the source as indicated, without any additional information.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Historical and Literary Knowledge**\n\n**Problem**: Given that Sir Robert Peel was responsible for the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1842 and that Curtis Jadwin is a character in Frank Norris''s novel *The Octave*, describe the relationship between these two pieces of information.\n\n**Answer**: "Sir Robert Peel, who repealed the Corn Laws in 1842, and Curtis Jadwin from Frank Norris''s *The Octave* are unrelated events in history and literature. However, both are significant in their respective fields: Peel''s economic reform influenced political history, while Jadwin''s character represents the complexities of ambition and morality in literature.\n\n**Source**: *Grove''s Dictionary of Music and Musicians*, 3d ed., II, 254.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate both historical and literary elements, referencing the source as indicated, without any external information.\n'

    Readings

    The following readings have been provided to serve as texts for the study
    of the principles of logic and rhetoric that have been discussed in this chap-
    ter. Theory exemplifies and proves itself in these readings. Many of the
    authors represented here were aware of, if they were not thoroughly schooled
    in, rhetorical principles. Those authors who were not conscious of the
    rhetorical tradition confirm, by their practice, the soundness and workability

    While the readings can be used for the study of many of the things discussed in this chapter—inductive and deductive reasoning, the ethical appeal, the emotional appeal, the external aids to invention—they are designed primarily as working texts for the analysis of the common topics and the special topics. In the process of composition, the topics serve as the initiators of a line of development; in analyzing these texts for evidence of the operation of the topics, the student is working backward from the finished text to what was, consciously or unconsciously, the beginning of the process. The student may realize two benefits from this exercise: he will see that the topics are indeed aids to the discovery of "the available means of persuasion in any given case"; and he will develop another technique for the close reading of texts. Once a reader begins to approach a text from the point of view of the topics, it is surprising how soon he develops an "eye" for the topics in any expository or argumentative prose that he reads.

    The first three readings, taken from Greek literature, are examples of, respectively, deliberative discourse, judicial discourse, and ceremonial discourse. Extended analyses of these three readings have been provided to serve as models for the student's analyses of the other readings. Among these are more examples of deliberative, judicial, and ceremonial discourses. The student should begin his analysis by classifying the text according to type, since such a classification will alert him to the special topics that will be operating in the text. The student will also find it useful to make an outline of the major divisions of the text he is analyzing.

    The last three readings—by Thomas Henry Huxley, Matthew Arnold, and J. Robert Oppenheimer, respectively—all treat a common subject, the relation between science and the humanities. Arnold's essay is a direct reply to the arguments that Huxley presented in his essay, both written in the nineteenth century. Oppenheimer's essay presents a modern discussion of the same subject.

    In addition to the student's own analyses of the readings, another exercise can be worked off the selections. The sample analyses have made little or

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Analysis Techniques**\n\nUsing the principles outlined in the text, analyze the structure and purpose of Thomas Henry Huxley''s essay on the relation between science and the humanities.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the primary rhetorical purpose of Huxley''s essay based on its context within the collection of readings.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the possible rhetorical strategies Huxley employed to support his purpose.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how the concept of ''topics'' as defined in the text is relevant to analyzing Huxley''s essay.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between rhetoric, topic classification, and expository prose as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Classification**\n\nClassify the following three readings based on their rhetorical type and explain your reasoning: \n1. The deliberative discourse from Greek literature\n2. Matthew Arnold''s essay on science and the humanities\n3. J. Robert Oppenheimer''s modern discussion of science and the humanities\n- **Part A**: For each reading, determine whether it is deliberative, judicial, ceremonial, or another type.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the classification affects your interpretation of the text''s purpose and structure.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the rhetorical functions of the three readings as described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your classification must be consistent with the definitions provided in the text, and your explanations should draw directly from the content of the readings.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nGiven the text''s discussion of ''topics'' as aids to persuasion, construct an argument that demonstrates how these topics can be used to analyze the relationship between science and the humanities as presented in Arnold''s essay.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two specific ''topics'' from the text that are relevant to Arnold''s discussion.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how these topics function as aids in the persuasion process.\n- **Step 3**: Draw a conclusion about how the application of these topics enhances the effectiveness of Arnold''s argument.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must directly reference the definitions and examples provided in the text, demonstrating a clear understanding of the role of topics in rhetorical analysis.'

    XENOPHON TALKS TO THE SOLDIERS

    1 Dawn was just breaking when the new officers were chosen, and they
    came to the centre of the camp and decided to post sentries and call the
    soldiers to a meeting. When the rest of the army was assembled, Chirisophus
    stood up first and spoke as follows: "Soldiers, our position is undoubtedly
    difficult. We have lost some very able generals and captains and soldiers, and
    in addition to that even Ariaeus's men, who used to be on our side, have
    turned traitor to us. All the same what we have to do is to surmount our
    difficulties like brave men, not to give in, but to try, if we can, to win honour
    and safety by victory. And if that is beyond us, then at least let us die with
    honour, and never, so long as we live, come into the power of our enemies.
    For if we do, we shall have to suffer, I imagine, the sort of fate which I
    pray the gods will bring upon our opponents."

    2 Next Cleanor of Orchomenus stood up and spoke as follows: "You can see with your own eyes, soldiers, how perjured and godless the King is. You can see the treachery of Tissaphernes. He it was who said that he was a neighbour of Greece, and that he would attach the greatest importance to saving our lives. On this understanding he swore an oath to us in person, he in person gave us his right hand, and in person he deceived our generals and made prisoners of them, showing so little respect for Zeus, the guardian of hospitality, that he actually shared a meal with Clearchus and then used this very fact to entrap and destroy our officers. Then there is Ariaeus, whom we were prepared to make King, and with whom we exchanged guarantees that neither would betray the other: he too, showing no fear of the gods or respect for the memory of the dead Cyrus, though he was treated with the utmost distinction by Cyrus when he was alive, has now left us and joined Cyrus's bitterest enemies, with whom he is attempting to injure us, who were Cyrus's friends. Well, I pray that the gods will give these men what they deserve. As for us, who see all this, we must never again be deceived by them, but must fight as hard as we can, and bear whatever is the will of heaven."

He  \nbegan his speech as follows: \"Cleanor has spoken of the natives' perjury and  \ntreachery, and I feel sure that you agree with what he has said. If, then, we  \nwant to make friends with them again, we shall have to be very downhearted  \nindeed, when we consider what happened to our generals, who, because they  \ntrusted in their good faith, put themselves into their hands. But if our pur-  \npose is to take our arms in our hands and to make them pay for what they  \nhave done and for the future to fight total war against them, then, with the  \nhelp of heaven, we have many glorious hopes of safety.\"\n\n4 Just as he was saying this, someone sneezed, and, when the soldiers heard  \nit, they all with one accord fell on their knees and worshipped the god who  \nhad given this sign. Xenophon went on: \"I think, soldiers, that, since an  \nomen from Zeus the Saviour appeared just when we were speaking about  \nsafety, we ought to make a vow that we will give thank-offerings to the  \ngod for our safety in the place where we first reach friendly soil, and we  \nshould also vow to offer sacrifices to the other gods to the best of our  \nability. Whoever agrees with this, put up his hand.\"\n\n5 Then they all raised their hands, and afterwards they made their vows  \nand sang the paean.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Reasoning**\n\nUsing the passage, analyze the rhetorical strategy employed by Xenophon in his speech.

- prompt: "5 The claims of religion having been thus satisfied, Xenophon started again  \nand spoke as follows: \"I was just saying that we had many glorious hopes  \nof safety. First of all, we have kept our oaths to the gods, while our enemies  \nhave broken theirs, and in addition to this perjured themselves in transgress-  \ning the truce. This being so, it is reasonable to suppose that the gods will  \nbe against our enemies, but will fight on our side; and they are capable of  \nquickly making even the strong weak, and of saving the weak easily, when  \nsuch is their will, even if they are in the midst of danger. And next I shall  \nremind you of the dangers which our fathers also have been through, so  \nthat you may realise that it is right for you to be brave men and that, with  \nthe help of the gods, the brave find safety even from the worst of difficulties.  \nRemember how the Persians and their friends came with an enormous army,  \nthinking that they would wipe Athens off the face of the earth; but the  \nAthenians had the courage to stand up to them by themselves, and they de-  \nfeated them. On that occasion they had made a vow to Artemis that they  \nwould sacrifice to her a goat for every one of their enemies whom they  \nkilled, but, since they could not get hold of enough goats, they decided to  \nsacrifice five hundred every year, and they are still sacrificing them today.  \nThen, when Xerxes later on collected his innumerable army and came against  \nGreece, there was another occasion when your fathers defeated the fathers  \nof these people both on land and on sea.

    The trophies we have, but the greatest piece of evidence of all is the freedom of the cities in which you have been born and brought up. For you worship no man as a master, but only the gods. These were the men whose sons you are; and I shall certainly not say that you dishonour your fathers. Not many days ago you were in battle order against the children of our old enemies, and, though they were many times your number, you, with the help of the gods, defeated them. And on that occasion you showed yourselves brave men in order to get Cyrus a kingdom; but now the fight is on for your own safety, and therefore I am sure it is right to expect from you much greater courage and a much greater will to victory. Then, too, you ought to feel much greater confidence against the enemy. On the last occasion you had no experience of them and you could see their prodigious numbers, but all the same in the spirit of your fathers you had the courage to set about them. Now, however, when you know from experience that, even if they are many times your number, they are not anxious to face you, what reason have you to be afraid of them any longer? Do not imagine that we are any the worse off because the native troops who were previously in our ranks have now left us. They are even greater cowards than the natives whom we have beaten, and they made this clear by deserting us and fleeing to the other side. It is far better to see people who want to be the first to run away standing in one's enemy's army than in one's own ranks.

    7 "If any of you feel disheartened because of the fact that we have no
    cavalry, while the enemy have great numbers of them, you must remember
    that ten thousand cavalry only amount to ten thousand men. No one has
    ever died in battle through being bitten or kicked by a horse; it is men who
    do whatever gets done in battle. And then we are on a much more solid
    foundation than cavalrymen, who are up in the air on horseback, and afraid
    not only of us but of falling off their horses: we, on the other hand, with
    our feet planted on the earth, can give much harder blows to those who
    attack us and are much more likely to hit what we aim at. There is only
    one way in which cavalry have an advantage over us, and that is that it is
    safer for them to run away than it is for us.

    8 "You may, of course, be quite confident about the fighting, but upset by
    the fact that Tissaphernes will no longer show you the way, nor will the
    King provide opportunities of buying food. If this is so, then consider whether
    it is better to have Tissaphernes to guide us, a man who is quite clearly
    working against us, or to have prisoners whom we shall order to show us
    the way and who will know that, if they make any mistakes which affect
    us, they will be mistakes that will also affect their own persons and their
    own lives. And on the question of supplies, is it better to buy in the markets
    which they provide, where we have to pay a lot to buy a little (and we have
    no longer even got the money), or is it better to beat them in battle and
    take our supplies for ourselves, each man taking the quantity he feels
    like having?"

    "You may realise that these alternatives are the better ones, but still think that the rivers are an insuperable obstacle and regard yourselves as having been led properly into a trap by crossing them. If so, then I will ask you to consider whether the natives have not done here a very stupid thing. For all rivers, however impassable they may be at a distance from their springs, can be forded, and without so much as getting one's knees wet, if one follows them up towards their sources. And even if we cannot get across the rivers, even if no one comes forward to show us the way, even then we have no reason to get downhearted. We would not call the Mysians better men than we are, yet we know that they hold many large and prosperous cities in the King's country and against the King's will. We know that the same is true of the Pisidians, and we saw with our own eyes how the Lycaonians have seized the fortified positions in the plains and enjoy the profit of the land that belongs to these natives. Now in our case I should say that we ought not to make it obvious that we are setting off home, but we should make our dispositions as though we had the idea of settling here. I am certain that the King would offer the Mysians all the guides they wanted, and would give them numbers of hostages to guarantee his good faith in sending them out of the country, and would actually build roads for them, even though they wanted to go away in four-horse chariots. And I am certain that we would be three times as pleased to do all this for us, if he saw that we were planning to stay here. No, what I am really afraid of is that, if we once learn to live a life of ease and luxury, enjoying the company of these fine great women, the wives and daughters of the Medes and Persians, we might be like the Lotus-eaters and forget about our road home.

    1x "It remains for me to mention what I think is the most important point
    of all. You can see what our enemies thought about it. They did not dare
    to make war on us until they had made prisoners of our generals, and this
    was because they thought that, so long as we had commanders and we were
    obedient to them, we were capable of coming out on top in the fighting;
    but once they had seized our commanders they thought that we would col-
    lapse through lack of control and lack of discipline. It is therefore necessary
    that the generals we have now should take much greater care than those
    we had before, and that those in the ranks should be much better disciplined
    and much more ready to obey their officers now than they were before. In
    cases of disobedience, we ought to vote that whichever of you happens to
    be on the spot should join with the officers in enforcing punishment. That
    would be the bitterest disappointment to our enemies; for, on the day that
    this is voted, they will see not one Clearchus but ten thousand, each one
    intolerant of any unsoldierly action.

    12 "But it is time for me to make an end. It may be that the enemy will
    be upon us at once. If you agree with the suggestions I have made, then
    let us have them passed officially as soon as possible, so that they may be put
    Into practice. If anyone knows a better way of going about things than the
    one I have outlined, then let him have the courage to tell us of it, even if
    he is only a common soldier. The safety which we are looking for is every-
    one's concern."

    13 Afterwards Chirisophus spoke. "If we want," he said, "to pass any other
    measure in addition to those which Xenophon suggests, we can do so in a
    moment or two. I propose that, with no delay, we should vote that what he
    has just suggested is the best course to pursue. Will those who agree put up

    14 They all put their hands up, and Xenophon got up again and spoke as
    follows: "Soldiers, listen to the additional proposals which I have to make.
    Obviously we must march somewhere where we can get provisions, and I
    gather that there are some fine villages not more than two miles away from
    here. But I should not be surprised if the enemy, like cowardly dogs that
    run after and try to bite anyone who goes past them, but run away from
    anyone who chases them,—I should not be surprised if they too follow in
    our tracks as we go away. Perhaps then it would be safer for us to march
    with the hoplites forming a hollow square, so that the baggage and the gen-
    eral crowd may be more secure inside. If, then, we were told now who
    should be in the front of the square and organise the leading detachments,
    182 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    and who should be on the two flanks, and who should be responsible for
    the rear, we should not have to plan all this when the enemy are approach-
    ing us, but could immediately make use of those who have been specially
    detailed for the job. If anyone has a better suggestion to make, let us adopt
    it. If not, then I propose that Chirisophus should lead the square: he has
    the additional advantage of being a Spartan. Two generals, the oldest ones,
    should look after the two flanks; and the youngest of us, that is Timasion
    and myself, should be responsible for the rear. I suggest this as a temporary
    measure. Later on we shall have tried out this order of march, and we can
    decide on what seems best as different circumstances arise. If anyone has a
    better suggestion to make, I should like him to put it forward."

    15 Then, as nobody raised any objections, Xenophon said, "Will those who
    agree with this put up their hands?" And the proposal was carried.

    16 "Now then," he continued, "we must leave the meeting and put into
    operation what we have decided. Whoever wants to see his own people again
    must remember to be a brave soldier: that is the only way of doing it. Who-
    ever wants to keep alive must aim at victory. It is the winners who do the
    killing and the losers who get killed. And those who want money must try
    to win battles. The winners can not only keep what they have themselves,
    but can take what belongs to the losers."

    ANALYSIS OF THE TOPICS
    IN "XENOPHON TALKS TO THE SOLDIERS"

    Xenophon's address to the Greek army is clearly an example of deliberative
    oratory. Xenophon is concerned with convincing the soldiers to adopt a cer-
    tain course of action. That the decision about the course of action is not
    made by the officers and imposed on the soldiers is evidenced by the fact
    that at the end of Xenophon's speech the question is put to the vote of the
    entire army. Moreover, the question is debatable, since there are alternatives
    to the course of action that Xenophon proposes.

    The Greeks are in desperate straits at this point. Hired by Cyrus to over-
    throw his brother King Artaxerxes, the Greeks had clashed with the Persian
    forces at Cunaxa, near the site of ancient Babylon. Although the Greeks won
    this battle, Cyrus was killed by a stray javelin, and subsequently his native
    troops deserted, leaving the Greeks without any supporting cavalry. During
    a truce that followed the battle, Tissaphernes invited the Greek commanders
    to a conference and then treacherously slew them. Not only are the Greeks
    at this point without their experienced generals and without cavalry troops,
    but they are surrounded by hostile people, deprived of native guides, and
    cut off from their homeland, a thousand miles away, by seemingly impass-
    able rivers. The 10,000 men with their cumbersome baggage trains have a
    READINGS 182

    crucial decision to make. What do they do now? Having disclosed his plan
    of action to the officers in the preceding chapter, Xenophon now assembles
    the soldiers and talks to them.

    This passage, which constitutes the whole of the second chapter of Book
    II of the Anabasis, falls into five main parts:

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Deliberative Oratory Elements**\n\nAnalyze Xenophon''s speech as an example of deliberative oratory. Identify three key rhetorical strategies used by Xenophon to persuade the soldiers, and explain how each strategy aligns with the characteristics of deliberative speaking as described in the text.\n- **Strategy 1**: The use of logical reasoning to justify the course of action.\n- **Strategy 2**: Appeal to shared values or common purpose among the soldiers.\n- **Strategy 3**: Use of a vote to involve the soldiers in decision-making.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s discussion of deliberative oratory and demonstrate an understanding of how each strategy contributes to persuasion.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning in Crisis Situations**\n\nGiven the dire circumstances faced by the Greek army, evaluate Xenophon''s argument that "the winners can not only keep what they have themselves, but can take what belongs to the losers."\n- **Part A**: Explain how this statement reflects the broader theme of survival in a hostile environment.\n- **Part B**: Justify why Xenophon''s recommendation to "aim at victory" is a logical response to the army''s current situation.\n- **Part C**: Compare this advice with the Greek perspective on warfare as described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the historical context provided and demonstrate a clear understanding of how Xenophon''s advice aligns with the army''s survival needs.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Military Context**\n\nImagine you are a soldier who has just been informed of the plan to leave the meeting and proceed with action. Write a short monologue (100-150 words) that reflects your internal conflict and decision-making process, based on Xenophon''s speech.\n- **Part A**: Express your initial hesitation or doubt about the plan.\n- **Part B**: Reference a specific rhetorical point made by Xenophon that influences your decision.\n- **Part C**: Conclude with a statement of resolve, showing how you have internalized Xenophon''s message.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your monologue must be in your own words and demonstrate a clear understanding of the themes and arguments presented in the text.'

- prompt: |-
    1. Introduction, in which the men are put into the proper mood by
    two brief speeches and by a religious omen (paragraphs 1-5).

    2. Xenophon's arguments to convince the men that they have a
    chance to win their way to safety (paragraph 6).

    3. Xenophon's answers to the counter-arguments that might be pro-
    posed (paragraphs 7-9).

    4. Xenophon's practical proposals for effectuating his plan (para-
    graphs 10-11).

    5. Conclusion, in which the matter is put to a vote and Xenophon
    makes some additional proposals and a final plea for his cause
    (paragraphs 12-16).

    The narrative framework can be regarded as providing the Introduction and
    Conclusion of Xenophon's speech; the speech itself has only three parts: the
    argument, the refutation, and the plan of action.

    The brief speeches of Chirisophus (paragraph 1) and Cleanor (paragraph
    2) and the omen of the sneeze which interrupts Xenophon's opening remarks
    (paragraphs 3-5) can be said to put the men into the proper emotional dis-
    position for Xenophon's address. By reminding the soldiers of the gravity
    of the situation, Chirisophus is playing on the emotion of fear and indirectly
    stirring up their sense of honor. By reminding the soldiers of the treachery
    of the Persians, Cleanor is arousing their resentment and anger against the
    enemy. The sneeze comes fortuitously, but Xenophon shrewdly takes advan-
    tage of the accident to lend a religious sanction to the Greek cause. The
    Greeks are in a favorable mood now, but they still have to be persuaded.

    The deliberative orator commonly exploits the special topics of the worthy
    (the good) and/or the advantageous. In other words, when the deliberative
    orator is seeking to persuade someone, he must show that what he proposes
    is worthy of pursuit for its own sake or is conducive to the well-being or
    happiness of the audience. In developing these special topics, the orator will
    have recourse to many of the common topics. Let us see what use Xenophon
    makes of the topics in his speech.

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesizing Emotional and Religous Motivation in Xenophon''s Speech\n\nIn the opening of Xenophon''s speech, Chirisophus uses a brief speech to evoke fear and honor, while Cleanor stirs resentment against the Persians. The sneeze is used as a religious omen to bolster the Greek cause.\n\n**Question**: How does Xenophon strategically use these initial emotional and religious elements to prepare the audience for his main argument?\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Analyze the role of Chirisophus''s speech in instilling fear and honor.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the sneeze serves as a religious omen and why this is effective in the context of Xenophon''s speech.\n- **Part C**: Justify why these initial elements are necessary for the audience to be receptive to Xenophon''s main argument about winning safety.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of emotional appeal and religious sanction as described in the text, showing how they set the stage for the subsequent logical arguments.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Applying Deliberative Rhetoric to Xenophon''s Argument\n\nThe text explains that a deliberative orator must show that their proposal is worthy of pursuit for its own sake or is conducive to the well-being of the audience.\n\n**Question**: How does Xenophon use the special topics of the worthy and the advantageous to argue for his plan?\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify two instances where Xenophon connects his proposal to the welfare of the audience.\n- **Part B**: Explain how these connections demonstrate that his plan is not only practical but also ethically sound.\n- **Part C**: Compare this approach to the common topics of persuasion (e.g., fear, anger) used in the opening.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both special and common topics in rhetoric, showing how Xenophon combines them to persuade the audience.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Critical Reasoning in Xenophon''s Refutation of Counter-Arguments\n\nThe text describes Xenophon''s refutation of potential counter-arguments as a key part of his speech.\n\n**Question**: What logical reasoning does Xenophon use to address and refute potential counter-arguments, and how does this strengthen his case?\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify one counter-argument that might be raised against Xenophon''s plan.\n- **Part B**: Explain how Xenophon refutes this counter-argument using logical reasoning from the text.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how this refutation contributes to the overall persuasiveness of his speech.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must show an ability to anticipate and logically counter potential objections, demonstrating a deep understanding of Xenophon''s rhetorical strategies.'

- prompt: |-
    In paragraph 6, Xenophon advances a number of arguments to stir up the
    soldier's will and courage to fight their way through to safety. The first
    argument that he advances is designed to show that fighting (the alternative
    is surrendering) is a worthy course of action. The argument takes the form
    of an enthymeme: since we have kept our oaths, while the enemy have
    184 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    broken theirs, it is reasonable to suppose that the gods will support us against
    our enemies. The full syllogistic argument, which in this case leads to a prob-
    able conclusion, might run something like this:

    The gods will support those who keep their oaths.
    We have kept our oaths.
    The gods will support us.

    The orator is arguing a future fact here and using an antecedent-consequent
    topic to develop his argument: being faithful to our oaths (antecedent) will
    lead to the support of the gods (consequent).

    The second argument that Xenophon advances in this paragraph is also
    calculated to convince the men of the worthiness of bravery. In support of
    this contention, Xenophon makes use of the common topic of precedent, re-
    minding the men of how bravely their forefathers fought against Persian
    invasions of the homeland. As signs that such brave fighting was a good, he
    cites the many trophies the Greeks gained and the present freedom of their
    cities.

    In the next argument, Xenophon makes use of the common topic of com-
    parison to advance the topic of the possible. He compares the situation at the
    battle of Cunaxa with the situation now. At Cunaxa, the men proved that
    they could fight as bravely and effectively as their fathers once fought. But
    at Cunaxa, the men were fighting for Cyrus, a foreigner; now they are
    fighting for their own safety. By using an a fortiori argument, Xenophon is
    trying to convince them of what is possible now. If they fought so effectively
    for a foreigner, how much more effectively they should be able to fight when
    they are fighting for themselves. In other words, if the more difficult task is
    possible, the less difficult is even more possible.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Strategies in Xenophon''s Argument**\n\nXenophon uses three distinct rhetorical strategies in this paragraph: an enthymeme, precedent, and comparison.

    As another argument in support of what is feasible now, Xenophon re-
    minds the soldiers that they are more experienced troops now than they were
    at the battle of Cunaxa. The consequence of more experience is greater con-
    fidence and therefore greater chance of success.

    Xenophon next assures the Greeks that the loss of Cyrus's mercenaries is
    really a gain, for cowards can never be an asset to one's side. Implicit in this
    enthymeme is the suggestion that the defection of the cowardly mercenaries
    will prove to be an advantage to the Greeks. What was possible for the
    Greeks to accomplish when their forces were filled out with cowardly, un-
    reliable troops will be even more possible when the army is made up exclu-
    sively of troops motivated by a cohesive loyalty.

    Having advanced arguments to support his contention that fighting, rather
    than surrendering, is the more worthy and advantageous course of action,
    Xenophon in the next three paragraphs (7, 8, 9) anticipates and answers
    some of the counter-arguments.

    READINGS 185

    First of all, he allays the soldiers' apprehensions about the enemy's cavalry
    by minimizing the effectiveness of cavalry in battle. Resorting to the common
    topic of comparison, Xenophon recognizes that there is a difference between
    fighting on foot and fighting on horses, but he argues that the difference
    gives the Greeks an advantage. It is men, after all, rather than horses that
    deal the death blow; and as far as men go, we can match them man for man.
    Then too a soldier can deal a more effective blow when his feet are planted
    on solid ground than when he is on a precarious perch in the saddle. There
    is, however, one advantage to fighting on horses: men on horseback can run
    away faster. The humorous irony of this last gibe was calculated to inspirit
    the men.

    In paragraph 8, Xenophon attempts to allay the soldiers' misgivings about losing Tissaphernes as a guide through this hostile, unknown country and about losing the opportunity to buy food from the natives. In resorting again to the common topic of comparison, this time to contrast the situation then with the situation now, Xenophon makes effective use of the sub-topic of degree (more and less). Tissaphernes was a good guide through this country, but a captured guide will be even better. Since, as we now know, Tissaphernes was secretly working against us, he could not really be relied on as a guide; but a native guide that we capture will prove to be more reliable because he knows that we will kill him if he dares to mislead us. Likewise, we have an advantage now in the procurement of supplies. Until now we have had to purchase our supplies in the marketplace. Now that a breach has developed in our pact with the Persians, we no longer have to live up to this gentleman's agreement; we can take by force what we no longer have the obligation or the money to buy. In both cases, then, we are better off now than we were before.

    In paragraph 9, Xenophon allays the soldiers' anxieties about being trapped in a hostile country. In reply to the argument that the rivers are impassable, Xenophon resorts to the topic of contradiction. He seems to be arguing in this way: rivers are either passable or not passable (a contradictory disjunctive proposition); but these rivers are passable (if we cannot ford them at their deepest part, we can always ford them near their sources, where they are shallow); so it is false to propose that these rivers are impassable. But suppose, he then suggests, that we grant the impossibility of fording the rivers. What then? Xenophon assures the soldiers that they need not feel downhearted at this prospect. Resorting to an a fortiori argument again, he points out to them that if the Mysians, Pisidians, and Lycaonians, who are decidedly lesser men than the Greeks, can seize and hold large, prosperous cities in this kingdom against the will of the Persians, surely the Greeks can do the same thing.

    Xenophon then resorts to the topic of future fact, to suggest the more

    likely eventuality. If we made it appear that we intended to settle down in
    this country the king would do everything in his power to facilitate our de-
    parture from his kingdom. To support this argument from future fact, Xeno-
    phon is using the principle that where the desire or the opportunity to do
    something exists, the thing will be done. The clinching argument now in
    Xenophon's refutation takes a subtle turn. His principal fear, he tells the
    soldiers, is that they will become so enamored of the life of luxury that it is
    possible to enjoy in this country that they, like Homer's Lotus Eaters, will
    not want to go home. He is holding out to them the prospect of the goods
    that can be theirs if they decide to stay, or are forced to stay, in this country
    —"a life of ease and luxury," "the company of these fine great women." As
    Xenophon says at the end of this paragraph, "All these good things come to
    the conquerors." The subtlety of this argument resides in the suggestion that
    even if they cannot fight their way out of this country the prospect of a
    forced sojourn here is far from bleak. So in any case it is better to fight than
    to lay down their arms. By fighting, they either win their way to the safety
    of their homeland or win for themselves a life of ease and luxury.

    Having argued that fighting bravely is both a worthy and an advantageous
    course of action and having refuted the counter-arguments, Xenophon now
    lays down some practical suggestions for the campaign ahead (paragraph
    10-11). It is not enough that he convince the men that this is the course of
    action to follow; he must show them how it can be pursued successfully. In
    the first sentence of paragraph 10, Xenophon discloses the purpose of what
    he is now about to do: "I must, however, deal with these questions—how we
    can make our march as free from danger as possible, and how, if we have
    to fight, we can fight to the best advantage." As Aristotle said in Book J,
    Chapter 7, of the Rhetoric, "Things are ‘practicable' in two senses: (1) it is
    possible to do them, (2) it is easy to do them." By proposing some practical
    suggestions for the march that lies ahead of the men, Xenophon can show
    them that it is possible or easy to implement the ideal of fighting bravely.
    Accordingly, he makes two practical suggestions: (1) they must jettison non-
    essential baggage so that they will have greater mobility; (2) they must
    tighten up the discipline of the army.

    In the final paragraph (16), Xenophon suggests that the soldiers may have
    one or more of the following ends in view: (1) to see their people again;
    (2) to stay alive; (3) to make money. Then he reminds them that these
    three ends can be effected only by fighting bravely. He has posed an either/or
    situation for them: either you fight, or you fail to realize whatever end you
    have in view. A close examination of this disjunctive proposition would
    reveal a logical flaw, but at this point, the soldiers are in no mood to take
    a close look at the logic. By using some clever rhetorical strategies, Xenophon
    has persuaded them that their situation, which before had seemed so des-

    1 How you, O Athenians, have been affected by my accusers, I cannot tell;
    but I know that they almost made me forget who I was—so persuasively did
    they speak; and yet they have hardly uttered a word of truth. But of the
    many falsehoods told by them, there was one which quite amazed me;—I
    mean when they said that you should be upon your guard and not allow
    yourselves to be deceived by the force of my eloquence. To say this, when
    they were certain to be detected as soon as I opened my lips and proved my-
    self to be anything but a great speaker, did indeed appear to me most shame-
    less—unless by the force of eloquence they mean the force of truth; for if
    such is their meaning, I admit that I am eloquent. But in how different a
    way from theirs! Well, as I was saying, they have scarcely spoken the truth
    at all; from me you shall hear the whole truth, but not delivered after their
    manner in a set oration duly ornamented with fine words and phrases. No,
    by heaven! I shall use the words and arguments which occur to me at the
    moment, for I am confident in the justice of my cause;* at my time of life
    I ought not to be appearing before you, O men of Athens, in the character
    of a boy inventing falsehoods—let no one expect it of me. And I must par-
    ticularly beg of you to grant me this favour:—If I defend myself in my
    accustomed manner, and you hear me using the words which many of you
    have heard me using habitually in the agora, at the tables of the money-
    changers, and elsewhere, I would ask you not to be surprised, and not to
    interrupt me on this account. For I am more than seventy years of age, and
    appearing now for the first time before a court of law, I am quite a stranger
    to the language of the place; and therefore I would have you regard me as
    if I were really a stranger, whom you would excuse if he spoke in his native
    tongue, and after the fashion of his country:—Am I making an unfair re-
    quest of you? Never mind the manner, which may or may not be good; but

    and then I will go on to the later ones. For of old I have had many accusers,
    who have accused me falsely to you during many years; and I am more
    afraid of them than of Anytus and his associates, who are dangerous, too, in
    their own way. But far more dangerous are the others, who began when
    most of you were children, and took possession of your minds with their
    falsehoods, telling of one Socrates, a wise man, who speculated about the
    heaven above, and searched into the earth beneath, and made the worse ap-
    pear the better cause. The men who have besmeared me with this tale are
    the accusers whom I dread; for their hearers are apt to fancy that such in-
    quirers do not believe in the existence of the gods. And they are many, and
    their charges against me are of ancient date, and they were made by them
    in the days when some of you were more impressible than you are now—in
    childhood, or it may have been in youth—and the cause went by default, for
    there was none to answer. And hardest of all, I do not know and cannot tell
    the names of my accusers; unless in the chance case of a comic poet. All who
    from envy and malice have persuaded you—some of them having first con-
    vinced themselves—all this class of men are most difficult to deal with; for
    I cannot have them up here, and cross-examine them, and therefore I must
    simply fight with shadows in my own defence, and argue when there is no
    one who answers. I will ask you then to take it from me that my opponents
    are of two kinds; one recent, the other ancient: and I hope that you will see
    the propriety of my answering the latter first, for these accusations you heard
    long before the others, and much oftener.

    heaven, and makes the worse appear the better cause, and teaches the afore-
    said practices to others.' Such is the nature of the accusation: it is just what
    you have yourselves seen in the comedy of Aristophanes,' who has intro-
    duced a man whom he calls Socrates, swinging about and saying that he
    walks on air, and talking a deal of nonsense concerning matters of which I
    do not pretend to know either much or little—not that I mean to speak dis-

    5 As little foundation is there for the report that I am a teacher, and take
    money; this accusation has no more truth in it than the other. Although,
    if a man were really able to instruct mankind, this too would, in my opinion,
    be an honour to him. There is Gorgias of Leontium, and Prodicus of Ceos,
    and Hippias of Elis, who go the round of the cities, and are able to persuade
    the young men to leave their own citizens by whom they might be taught
    for nothing, and come to them whom they not only pay, but are thankful if
    they may be allowed to pay them. There is at this time a Parian philosopher
    residing in Athens, of whom I have heard; and I came to hear of him in
    this way:—I came across a man who has spent more money on the sophists
    than the rest of the world put together, Callias, the son of Hipponicus, and
    knowing that he had sons, I asked him: ‘Callias,' I said, ‘if your two sons
    were foals or calves, there would be no difficulty in finding someone to put
    over them; we should hire a trainer of horses, or a farmer probably, who
    would improve and perfect them in the appropriate virtue and excellence;
    but as they are human beings, whom are you thinking of placing over them?
    Is there anyone who understands human and civic virtue? You must have
    thought about the matter, for you have sons; is there anyone?' "There is,' he
    said. ‘Who is he?' said I; ‘and of what country? and what does he charge?'
    ‘Evenus the Parian,' he replied; ‘he is the man, and his charge is five minas.'
    Happy is Evenus, I said to myself, if he really has this wisdom, and teaches
    at such a moderate charge. Had I the same, I should have been very proud
    and conceited; but the truth is that I have no knowledge of the kind.

    6 I dare say, Athenians, that someone among you will reply, "Yes, Socrates,
    but what is your occupation? What is the origin of these accusations which
    are brought against you; there must have been something strange which you
    have been doing? All these rumours and this talk about you would never
    have arisen if you had been like other men: tell us, then, what is the cause
    of them, for we should be sorry to judge hastily of you.' Now I regard this
    as a fair challenge, and I will endeavour to explain to you the reason why I
    am called wise and have such an evil fame. Please to attend then. And al-
    though some of you may think I am joking, I declare that I will tell you
    the entire truth. Men of Athens, this reputation of mine has come of a cer-
    tain sort of wisdom which I possess. If you ask me what kind of wisdom,
    I reply, wisdom such as may perhaps be attained by man, for to that extent

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Classical Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nIn the text, Socrates is challenged to explain why he is considered wise despite his reputation. Using classical rhetorical principles from the text, analyze how Socrates'' response to the challenge reflects the concept of ''the unexamined life is not worth living.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the rhetorical strategies used by Socrates (e.g., irony, paradox) in his response.\n- **Step 2**: Connect these strategies to the philosophical idea of self-examination as central to wisdom.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with how Socrates'' admission of ignorance contributes to the argument that an unexamined life is not worth living.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must incorporate at least two classical rhetorical devices and explicitly tie them to the philosophical concept presented in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Definitions**\n\nExplain how the text''s definition of ''virtue'' as ''the ability to know what is right and do it'' relates to the concept of ''excellence in speech'' (oration).\n- **Step 1**: Define ''virtue'' based on the text''s provided definition.\n- **Step 2**: Use a rhetorical example from the text to demonstrate how virtue is essential for effective oratory.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the ability to know what is right is more critical than the mere ability to speak well in the context of classical rhetoric.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference at least one example from the text and directly link virtue to the practice of rhetoric.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nThe text presents Socrates as someone who claims to be wise because he knows his own ignorance. Construct a logical argument for why this self-awareness is the foundation of true wisdom in classical rhetoric.\n- **Part A**: Define ''ignorance'' and ''wisdom'' as per the text''s definitions.\n- **Part B**: Use logical reasoning to show how acknowledging ignorance leads to a deeper understanding of truth.\n- **Part C**: Compare this approach to the ''learned'' speaker who claims to know everything. Explain why Socrates'' method is more effective in the context of classical rhetoric.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be structured logically, reference at least two definitions from the text, and clearly contrast Socrates'' method with that of a traditional speaker.'

    I am inclined to believe that I am wise; whereas the persons of whom I was speaking have a kind of superhuman wisdom, which I know not how to describe, because I have it not myself; and he who says that I have, speaks falsely, and is taking away my character. And here, O men of Athens, I must beg you not to interrupt me, even if I seem to say something extravagant. For the word which I will speak is not mine. I will refer you to a witness who is worthy of credit; that witness shall be the god of Delphi—he will tell you about my wisdom, if I have any, and of what sort it is. You must have known Chaerephon; he was early a friend of mine, and also a friend of yours, for he shared in the recent exile of the people, and returned with you. Well, Chaerephon, as you know, was very impetuous in all his doings, and he went to Delphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him whether—as I was saying, I must beg you not to interrupt—he actually asked the oracle to tell him whether anyone was wiser than I was, and the Pythian prophetess answered that there was no man wiser. Chaerephon is dead himself; but his brother, who is in court, will confirm the truth of what I am saying.

Identify and explain this technique, then apply it to a modern context.\n- **Part A**: Describe the rhetorical device used in Socrates'' dialogue with the Oracle. How does this device create a paradoxical situation?\n- **Part B**: Create an example of how this same rhetorical technique could be applied in a modern debate or argument.\n- **Part C**: Justify why this rhetorical strategy is effective in establishing credibility and engaging the audience''s critical thinking.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a deep understanding of classical rhetoric, apply it to a modern scenario, and explain its effectiveness in persuasive communication.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Ethical Statements**\n\nThe text contains a statement that challenges the audience''s perception of wisdom: ''I must beg you not to interrupt me, even if I seem to say something extravagant.''\n- **Part A**: Analyze the logical structure of this statement. What is Socrates implying about his own credibility and the audience''s role in the dialogue?\n- **Part B**: Construct a counterargument to Socrates'' claim that ''no man is wiser than I.'' Use logical reasoning based on the text''s discussion of wisdom and knowledge.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how Socrates'' admission of ignorance relates to the concept of ''prudence.'' How does this relate to the ethical responsibilities of a public speaker?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate logical reasoning, ethical analysis, and a clear understanding of the text''s philosophical implications.'

    7 Why do I mention this? Because I am going to explain to you why I
    have such an evil name. When I heard the answer, I said to myself, What
    can the god mean? and what is the interpretation of his riddle? for I know
    that I have no wisdom, small or great. What then can he mean when he says
    that I am the wisest of men? And yet he is a god, and cannot lie; that would
    be against his nature. After long perplexity, I thought of a method of trying
    the question. I reflected that if I could only find a man wiser than myself,
    then I might go to the god with a refutation in my hand. I should say to
    him, ‘Here is a man who is wiser than I am; but you said that I was the
    wisest.' Accordingly I went to one who had the reputation of wisdom, and
    observed him—his name I need not mention, he was a politician; and in the
    process of examining him and talking with him, this, men of Athens, was
    what I found. I could not help thinking that he was not really wise, although
    he was thought wise by many, and still wiser by himself; and thereupon I
    tried to explain to him that he thought himself wise, but was not really wise;
    and the consequence was that he hated me, and his enmity was shared by
    several who were present and heard me. So I left him, saying to myself as
    I went away: Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows any-
    thing really worth knowing, I am at least wiser than this fellow—for he
    knows nothing, and thinks that he knows; I neither know nor think that I
    know. In this one little point, then, I seem to have the advantage of him.
    Then I went to another who had still higher pretensions to wisdom, and my
    conclusion was exactly the same. Whereupon I made another enemy of him,
    and of many others besides him.

    8 Then I went to one man after another, being not unconscious of the
    enmity which I provoked, and I lamented and feared this: but necessity was

- prompt: "Laid upon me,—the word of God, I thought, ought to be considered first.  \nAnd I said to myself, Go I must to all who appear to know, and find out the meaning of the oracle. And I swear to you, Athenians,—for I must tell you the truth—the result of my mission was just this: I found that the men most in repute were nearly the most foolish; and that others less esteemed were really closer to wisdom. I will tell you the tale of my wanderings and of the ‘Herculean' labours, as I may call them, which I endured only to find at last the oracle irrefutable. After the politicians, I went to the poets; tragic, dithyrambic, and all sorts. And there, I said to myself, you will be instantly detected; now you will find out that you are more ignorant than they are. Accordingly, I took them some of the most elaborate passages in their own writings, and asked what was the meaning of them—thinking that they would teach me something. Will you believe me? I am ashamed to confess the truth, but I must say that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they did themselves. So I learnt that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them. The poets appeared to me to be much in the same case; and I further observed that upon the strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men in other things in which they were not wise. So I departed, conceiving myself to be superior to them for the same reason that I was superior to the politicians.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

    At last I went to the artisans, for I was conscious that I knew nothing at all, as I may say, and I was sure that they knew many fine things; and here I was not mistaken, for they did know many things of which I was ignorant, and in this they certainly were wiser than I was. But I observed that even the good artisans fell into the same error as the poets;—because they were good workmen they thought that they also knew all sorts of high matters, and this defect in them overshadowed their wisdom; and therefore I asked myself on behalf of the oracle, whether I would like to be as I was, neither having their knowledge nor their ignorance, or like them in both; and I made answer to myself and to the oracle that I was better off as I was.

    10 This inquisition has led to my having many enemies of the worst and most dangerous kind, and has given rise also to many imputations, including the name of ‘wise'; for my hearers always imagine that I myself possess the wisdom which I find wanting in others. But the truth is, O men of Athens, that God only is wise; and by his answer he intends to show that the wisdom of men is worth little or nothing; although speaking of Socrates, he is only using my name by way of illustration, as if he said, He, O men, is the wisest, who, like Socrates, knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing. And so I go about the world, obedient to the god, and search and make inquiry into the wisdom of anyone, whether citizen or stranger, who appears to be wise; and if he is not wise, then in vindication of the oracle I show him that he is not wise; and my occupation quite absorbs me, and I have had no time to do anything useful either in public affairs or in any concern of my own, but I am in utter poverty by reason of my devotion to the god.

    1. There is another thing:—young men of the richer classes, who have not much to do, come about me of their own accord; they like to hear people examined, and they often imitate me, and proceed to do some examining themselves; there are plenty of persons, as they quickly discover, who think that they know something, but really know little or nothing; and then those who are examined by them instead of being angry with themselves are angry with me: This confounded Socrates, they say; this villainous misleader of youth!—and then if somebody asks them, Why, what evil does he practise or teach? they do not know, and cannot tell; but in order that they may not appear to be at a loss, they repeat the ready-made charges which are used against all philosophers about teaching things up in the clouds and under the earth, and having no gods, and making the worse appear the better cause; for they do not like to confess that their pretence of knowledge has been de- tected—which is the truth; and as they are numerous and ambitious and energetic, and speak vehemently with persuasive tongues, they have filled your ears with their loud and inveterate calumnies. And this is the reason why my three accusers, Meletus and Anytus and Lycon, have set upon me; Meletus, who has a quarrel with me on behalf of the poets; Anytus, on behalf of the craftsmen and politicians; Lycon, on behalf of the rhetoricians: and as I said at the beginning, I cannot expect to get rid of such a mass of calumny all in a moment. And this, O men of Athens, is the truth and the whole truth; I have concealed nothing, I have dissembled nothing. And yet, I feel sure that my plainness of speech is fanning their hatred of me, and what is their hatred but a proof that I am speaking the truth?—Hence has arisen the prejudice against me; and this is the reason of it, as you will find out either in this or in any future inquiry.

    12 I have said enough in my defence against the first class of my accusers;
    I turn to the second class. They are headed by Meletus, that good man and
    true lover of his country, as he calls himself. Against these, too, I must try
    to make a defence:—Let their affidavit be read: it contains something of this
    kind: It says that Socrates is a doer of evil, inasmuch as he corrupts the
    youth, and does not receive the gods whom the state receives, but has a new
    religion of his own. Such is the charge; and now let us examine the particular
    counts. He says that I am a doer of evil, and corrupt the youth; but I say,
    O men of Athens, that Meletus is a doer of evil, in that he is playing a solemn
    farce, recklessly bringing men to trial from a pretended zeal and interest
    about matters in which he really never had the smallest interest. And the
    truth of this I will endeavour to prove to you.

    13 Come hither, Meletus, and let me ask a question of you. You attach
    great importance to the improvement of youth?

    14 Yes, I do.

    15 Tell the judges, then, who is their improver; for you must know, as you
    take such interest in the subject, and have discovered their corrupter, and
    are citing and accusing me in this court. Speak, then, and tell the judges who
    is the improver of youth:—Observe, Meletus, that you are silent, and have
    nothing to say. But is this not rather disgraceful, and a very considerable
    proof of what I was saying, that you have no interest in the matter? Speak
    up, friend, and tell us who their improver is.

    17 But that, my good sir, is not my question: Can you not name some per-
    son—whose first qualification will be that he knows the laws?

    18 The judges, Socrates, who are present in court.

    19 What, do you mean to say, Meletus, that they are able to instruct and
    improve youth?

    20 Certainly they are.

    21 What, all of them, or some only and not others?

    22 All of them.

    23 Truly, that is good news! There are plenty of improvers, then. And
    what do you say of the audience,—do they improve them?

    24 Yes, they do.

    25 And the senators?

    26 Yes, the senators improve them.

    27 But perhaps the members of the assembly corrupt them?—or do they
    too improve them?

    28 They improve them.

    29 Then every Athenian improves and elevates them; all with the excep-
    tion of myself; and I alone am their corrupter? Is that what you affirm?

    30 That is what I stoutly affirm.

    31 I am very unfortunate if you are right. But suppose I ask you a question:
    Is it the same with horses? Does one man do them harm and all the world
    good? Is not the exact opposite the truth? One man is able to do them good,
    or at least very few;—the trainer of horses, that is to say, does them good,
    but the ordinary man does them harm if he has to do with them? Is not that
    true, Meletus, of horses, or of any other animals? Most assuredly it is;
    whether you and Anytus say yes or no. Happy indeed would be the condi-
    tion of youth if they had one corrupter only, and all the rest of the world
    were their benefactors. But you, Meletus, have sufficiently shown that you
    never had a thought about the young: your carelessness is plainly seen in
    your not caring about the very things which you bring against me.

    32 And now, Meletus, I adjure you to answer me another question: Which
    194 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    is better, to live among bad citizens, or among good ones? Answer, friend,
    I say; the question is one which may be easily answered. Do not the good
    do their neighbours good, and the bad do them evil?

    33 Certainly.

    34 And is there anyone who would rather be injured than benefited by
    those who live with him? Answer, my good friend, the law requires you to
    answer—does anyone like to be injured?

    35 Certainly not.

    36 And when you accuse me of corrupting and deteriorating the youth, do
    you allege that I corrupt them intentionally or unintentionally?

    37 Intentionally, I say.

Using examples from the text, explain how this reflects broader moral and social responsibility.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key statement: "Every Athenian improves and elevates them; all with the exception of myself."\n- **Step 2**: Connect this to the analogy with horses: "One man is able to do them good, or at least very few."\n- **Step 3**: Analyze the implications for social responsibility, using Socrates'' argument that "you never had a thought about the young: your carelessness is plainly seen."\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate Socrates'' reasoning about the role of individuals in society and demonstrate understanding of the ethical implications of personal responsibility.  '

Using the text, compare and contrast the roles of a "trainer of horses" with an "ordinary man."\n- **Part A**: Explain the difference in responsibility between these two roles based on the text: "the trainer of horses, that is to say, does them good, but the ordinary man does them harm if he has to do with them?"\n- **Part B**: Apply this analogy to the argument about corrupting youth. Justify why Socrates claims he is "the only corrupter" while others are "benefactors."\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how this analogy supports the idea that moral responsibility is subjective and context-dependent.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the analogy''s purpose and its implications for ethical reasoning.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Social Ethics**\n\nThe text presents a dialogue where Socrates challenges Meletus by questioning the moral responsibility of individuals. Using the text, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: What is the core of Socrates'' argument regarding the role of individuals in shaping society?\n- **Part B**: How does Socrates use the analogy of horses to refute Meletus'' accusation?\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the logical consistency of Socrates'' claim that "every Athenian improves and elevates them". Consider the text''s assertion that "you never had a thought about the young: your carelessness is plainly seen."\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the logical structure of Socrates'' argument and demonstrate a deep understanding of the ethical implications presented in the dialogue.'

    41 Then, by the gods, Meletus, of whom we are speaking, tell me and the
    court, in somewhat plainer terms, what you mean! for I do not as yet under-
    stand whether you affirm that I teach other men to acknowledge some gods,
    and therefore that I do believe in gods, and am not an entire atheist—this
    you do not lay to my charge,—but only you say that they are not the same
    gods which the city recognizes—the charge is that they are different gods.
    Or, do you mean that I am an atheist simply, and a teacher of atheism?

    42 I mean the latter—that you are a complete atheist.

    43 What an extraordinary statement! Why do you think so, Meletus? Do
    you mean that I do not believe in the god-head of the sun or moon, like the
    rest of mankind?

    44 I assure you, judges, that he does: for he says that the sun is stone, and
    the moon earth.

    45 Friend Meletus, do you think that you are accusing Anaxagoras? Have
    you such a low opinion of the judges, that you fancy them so illiterate as not
    to know that these doctrines are found in the books of Anaxagoras the
    Clazomenian, which are full of them? And so, forsooth, the youth are said
    to be taught them by Socrates, when they can be bought in the book-market
    for one drachma at most; and they might pay their money, and laugh at
    Socrates if he pretends to father these extraordinary views. And so, Meletus,
    you really think that I do not believe in any god?

    46 I swear by Zeus that you verily believe in none at all.

    47 Nobody will believe you, Meletus, and I am pretty sure that you do not
    believe yourself. I cannot help thinking, men of Athens, that Meletus is reck-
    less and impudent, and that he has brought this indictment in a spirit of mere
    wantonness and youthful bravado. Has he not compounded a riddle, think-
    ing to try me? He said to himself:—I shall see whether the wise Socrates
    will discover my facetious self-contradiction, or whether I shall be able to
    deceive him and the rest of them. For he certainly does appear to me to con-
    tradict himself in the indictment as much as if he said that Socrates is guilty
    of not believing in the gods, and yet of believing in them—but this is not
    like a person who is in earnest.

    48 I should like you, O men of Athens, to join me in examining what I
    conceive to be his inconsistency; and do you, Meletus, answer. And I must
    remind the audience of my request that they would not make a disturbance
    if I speak in my accustomed manner:

    49 Did ever man, Meletus, believe in the existence of human things, and
    not of human beings? ...I wish, men of Athens, that he would answer, and
    not be always trying to get up an interruption. Did ever any man believe in
    horsemanship, and not in horses? or in flute-playing, and not in flute-players?
    My friend, no man ever did; I answer to you and to the court, as you refuse
    to answer for yourself. But now please to answer the next question: Can a
    man believe in the existence of things spiritual and divine, and not in spirits
    or demigods?

    50 He cannot.

    51 How lucky I am to have extracted that answer, by the assistance of the
    court! But then you swear in the indictment that I teach and believe in
    divine or spiritual things (new or old, no matter for that); at any rate, I
    believe in spiritual things,—so you say and swear in the affidavit; and yet if
    I believe in them, how can I help believing in spirits or demigods;—must I

    Is it not? To be sure I must; your silence gives consent. Now what are spirits or demigods? Are they not either gods or the sons of gods?

    52 Certainly they are.

    53 But this is what I call the facetious riddle invented by you: the demigods or spirits are gods, and you say first that I do not believe in gods, and then again that I do believe in gods; that is, if I believe in demigods. For if the demigods are the illegitimate sons of gods, whether by nymphs, or by other mothers, as some are said to be—what human being will ever believe that there are no gods when there are sons of gods? You might as well affirm the existence of mules, and deny that of horses and asses. Such nonsense, Meletus, could only have been intended by you to make trial of me. You have put this into the indictment because you could think of nothing real of which to accuse me. But no one who has a particle of understanding will ever be convinced by you that a man can believe in the existence of things divine and superhuman, and the same man refuse to believe in gods and demigods and heroes.

    54 I have said enough in answer to the charge of Meletus: any elaborate defence is unnecessary. You know well the truth of my statement that I have incurred many violent enmities; and this is what will be my destruction if I am destroyed;—not Meletus, nor yet Anytus, but the envy and detraction of the world, which has been the death of many good men, and will probably be the death of many more; there is no danger of my being the last of them.

    A fair enough sample for analysis of this classic example of judicial rhetoric.

    Judicial rhetoric is exercised most frequently in the courtroom, but this kind
    of persuasive discourse comprehends as well all extra-courtroom defenses of
    actions and character. If we understand the term apologize in its Greek sense
    of "to defend" and the term categorize in its Greek sense of "to accuse," we
    have two terms which most aptly describe the basic functions of judicial dis-
    course. This term can comprehend works as various as Newman's Apologiu
    Pro Vita Sua, Zola's J'accuse, Pope's Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot, and the cata-
    logue of charges against the king of England in the Declaration of Independ-
    ence. If we are haled into court today we would probably entrust our defense
    to a lawyer. But there may be many occasions in life when we will be called
    upon to justify our conduct outside the courtroom.

    Socrates' defense is a serious affair, for Socrates is liable to the death
    sentence if the jury returns a verdict of guilty. As every schoolboy knows,
    Socrates lost his case and was made to drink the fatal "cup of hemlock."
    Almost everyone today who reads the Apology feels that Socrates had suc-
    cessfully answered the charges against him. The jury that heard Socrates'
    eloquent plea in the Athenian assembly was not more obtuse than modern
    readers; it happened that a number of extra-legal considerations played a part
    in their verdict. We will ignore here these extra-legal considerations that
    prejudiced the decision and concentrate on the speech itself.

- prompt: "As we have seen, the special topics that figure in judicial discourse are  \njustice and injustice (or right and wrong, understood in their legal sense).  \nIn pursuing these special topics, the judicial speaker or writer is concerned  \nprimarily with one of these three questions: (1) whether the charge is so  \n(an sit); (2) what the nature of the charge is (quid sit); (3) how serious  \nthe charge is (quale sit). In the course of a trial, the court may consider all  \nthree of these questions, but ultimately it must decide which one of these  \nquestions is at issue in a particular case. If an sit is the point at issue, evi-  \ndence will be the main special topic; if quid sit, definition; if quale sit,  \nmotives or causes of action. In pursuit of the issue, the judicial pleader will  \npursue several of the common topics too.

The reminder that he is seventy years old might be  \nviewed as an emotional appeal for the sympathy or mercy of the court, but  \nsince Socrates nowhere else in the speech sounds this note, he seems to be  \nreluctant to entrust his vindication to the emotional response of his hearers.  \nStrategically, this avoidance of emotional appeal may have been a mistake,  \nbut distrust of emotion was typical of Socrates.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

Justify your answer by referencing specific elements of his speech, such as his praise of his accusers'' eloquence and his reliance on the truth.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how Socrates refutes the charges in paragraphs 4-12.

    Resorting to the common topic of division in the second paragraph, Socrates divides the charges into two general classes, the ancient and the recent, and announces that he will answer the two groups of charges in turn. He does not specify the charges under these two general heads, being content here to indicate the general organization of his defense.

    198 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    In paragraph 4 (after the transitional third paragraph) Socrates specifies the ancient charges. According to the "affidavit," he is charged with (1) being a student of natural philosophy; (2) making the worse appear the better cause; (3) being a teacher of these doctrines and taking money for his teaching. Pursuing the question of whether the first charge is true (an sit), Socrates denies the charge, maintaining that he has never engaged in speculations about physical matters. For confirmation of his claim, he calls for the testimony of those present. "Speak then," he says, "you who have heard me, and tell your neighbours whether any of you have ever known me hold forth in few words or in many upon such matters." This invitation meets with a stony silence from the audience. The implication of this silence is that there is no evidence to substantiate this ancient charge. It is simply not true. Since it is not true, Socrates does not have to go on to consider the nature of the offense and the seriousness of the offense.

    Nor is there any evidence to substantiate the charge that he is a teacher
    and accepts money for his services. One wonders why no one in the assembly
    challenged Socrates' denial that he was a teacher. Socrates is certainly known
    to us, as he must have been to his contemporaries, as a teacher. Probably
    what is involved here is a matter of definition. What Socrates may be imply-
    ing here—and he seems to be arguing this point in the next paragraph
    where he pursues the question of whether he is a wise man—is that techni-
    cally he does not and cannot qualify as a teacher. After denying the charge,
    Socrates touches for a moment on the quale sit of the charge. Even if he were
    a qualified teacher who took money for his services, as do the sophists
    Gorgias and Prodicus and Hippias and Evenus, he would not consider this
    a crime. Resorting to analogy, Socrates reminds his audience that just as we
    would not consider it a crime if a trainer took a fee for improving foals or
    calves, so we should not consider it a crime if a teacher takes money for
    improving the minds of young people.

    Socrates does not confront the charge that he makes the worse appear the
    better cause, but a denial of this charge seems to be implicit in his denial of
    the other two charges, and this charge is refuted really by some of the later
    arguments.

    In paragraph 6, Socrates moves on to consider the reason why these false
    charges were levelled against him. Surely there must be some grounds for
    these charges. Their origin, Socrates thinks, lies in the pronouncement by
    the Delphic Oracle, "Socrates is the wisest man." When this Delphic pro-
    nouncement was reported to Socrates, he reasoned in the form of an enthy-
    meme: "The god must be right, because a god cannot lie." But in what sense
    can the god be right in claiming that Socrates is the wisest of men?

    In seeking an answer to this question, Socrates turns, in paragraph 7, to
    the common topic of definition. He recounts (in paragraphs 7, 8, 9) his ex-

    They were supposedly wise and he wanted to find out why they were wise.
    But these so-called wise men disillusioned him. They were not really wise at
    all, and what was worse, they did not acknowledge or even recognize that
    they were ignorant. As a result of these inquiries, Socrates discovered the sense
    in which it could be said that he was the wisest of men: he alone knew
    that he did not know.

    It is this rather paradoxical superiority that accounts for the animosity
    against Socrates. Moreover, the young people, who by nature relish the ex-
    posure of pretenders, began to imitate Socrates by examining charlatans.
    The pretenders to knowledge, disgruntled by their exposure, resorted to the
    standard but unproven charges made against all philosophers—that they
    teach things up in the clouds, that they have no gods, and that they make
    the worse appear the better cause. Prejudice, then, has motivated the wild,
    indiscriminate charges. Prejudice has prompted not only the old accusers
    but the recent accurers as well. Meletus is responding on behalf of the poets;
    Anytus, on behalf of the craftsmen and politicians; Lycon, on behalf of
    rhetoricians. Socrates concludes this part of his defense with an appeal to
    some rather dubious logic: "and what is their hatred but a proof that I am
    speaking the truth?" Socrates regards hatred as a sign. By the rules of strict
    logic, this sign cannot lead to an infallible conclusion. But the student may
    remember that Aristotle also recognized the effectiveness, for rhetorical
    purposes, of signs which lead only to probable conclusions. This kind of
    sign, as in the case of all probabilities, can produce only belief, not con-
    viction.

    In paragraph 12, Socrates specifies the charges made by the second group of accusers: (1) that I am a doer of evil; (2) that I corrupt the youth; (3) that I do not believe in the gods of the state; (4) that I set up other gods. Socrates reverses the first charge on Meletus; he will endeavor to show that it is Meletus who is the doer of evil, because he is not really serious about these matters. This reversing of the charge is a device recommended by all the classical rhetoricians. It puts the accuser on the defensive, and if the counter-charge can be substantiated, it takes the pressure off the de-fender.

    In paragraphs 13-53, as we saw in the outline, Socrates cross-examines Meletus. Socrates shifts here from the discursive method of the early part of his defense to the question-and-answer style of dialectic. But although he has shifted his method, he does not abandon recourse to the special and common topics.

    In paragraphs 18-38 of this section, Socrates examines the justice of the charge that he is a corrupter of the youth. At the outset of this cross-examination, Socrates resorts to the common topic of contraries. He says, in effect, "If I am a corrupter of youth, there must be some people whom Meletus regards as being improvers of youth." Who are these improvers of youth? Socrates gets Meletus to affirm that the judges, the audience, the senators, the members of the assembly—in fact, all Athenians except Socrates—improve the youth. Socrates proceeds to reduce this claim to absurdity by resorting to an analogy (the topic of similarity). Just as horses are improved, not by everyone but by the one man who is an excellent horse-trainer, so youth are improved not by the many but by the one. So Meletus' claim that Socrates alone corrupts the youth and that all other men improve the youth is manifestly absurd. (Note that there is an implied a fortiori argument in Socrates' application of the analogy.)

    In paragraphs 32-8, Socrates approaches the same charge from another
    tack. First of all, he prompts Meletus to agree to the truth of three proposi-
    tions: (1) the good do good to their neighbors; the evil do evil; (2) everyone
    would rather be benefited than injured by another; (3) I corrupt the youth
    either intentionally or unintentionally. Having secured agreement on these
    three propositions, Socrates uses the third of them as the starting point of
    his refutation. As we saw in the exposition of contradiction under the com-
    mon topic of comparison, contradictory propositions are incompatible—that
    is, they cannot both be true. And we saw also that if one proposition is
    proved to be false, the other is automatically true. Socrates' strategy is to
    show that the proposition "Socrates corrupts the youth intentionally" is false.
    Note how cleverly he makes use of the other two propositions that Meletus
    has agreed to:

    But how could I corrupt the youth intentionally? If I corrupt them, they
    become evil. Once they become evil, they are liable to harm me (because,
    as we agreed, the evil do evil). But since I—like everyone else—would
    rather be benefited than injured by my neighbor, it is not likely that I
    would intentionally produce the kind of person who would injure me.
    So we can dismiss the charge that I corrupt the youth intentionally.

    The argument has been reduced now to two possibilities (and we can regard
    these as contraries): either [ do not corrupt the youth, or I corrupt them
    unintentionally. Socrates now deals with these contraries in this fashion:

    Let's arbitrarily rule out the first possibility, since you have formally
    accused me of corrupting the youth. That leaves us with the possi-
    bility that I corrupt the youth unintentionally. But if I corrupt the
    youth unintentionally, I am not subject to the law, and I should not
    be in this courtroom at all.

    By demonstrating the absurdity of Meletus' charge, Socrates has been in-
    directly proving what he said he would prove: that Meletus could not have
    made these charges seriously and that therefore he is the real doer of evil.

    In paragraphs 39-53, Socrates demonstrates the inconsistency of the charge

    That he is an atheist. He detects in items 3 and 4 of this indictment a flagrant contradiction: item 3 claims that he does not believe in the gods; item 4 implies that he does believe in the gods. To prove that item 3 is untrue, Socrates makes use of the common topics of similarity and genus and species. He gets Meletus to admit that one cannot believe in humanity without believing in human beings, in horsemanship without believing in horses, in flute-playing without believing in flute-players; in other words, one cannot believe in the genus without believing in the species. Similarly, one cannot believe in divine agencies (as item 4 claims) without believing in spirits and demi-gods. So the charge that Socrates does not believe in the gods is utterly false. By the principle of contradiction, if one proposition in a contradictory opposition is false, the other proposition is true. Therefore Socrates does believe in the gods.

    In paragraph 54, the last paragraph in the selection reproduced here, Socrates points out that he has successfully answered the charges levelled by Meletus and Anytus. He recognizes, however, that during his lifetime he has incurred the enmity of many people and that it is this enmity, rather than the indictments, that will eventually prove to be his undoing. Through this half of the Apology, Socrates has employed a negative strategy—the strategy of refutation—but from this point on Socrates will be advancing positive arguments for his innocence.

    It might be pointed out finally that a great part of Socrates' strategy throughout this section was an effort to minimize Meletus' ethical appeal. At the same time that he is refuting Meletus' charges he is showing indirectly that Meletus is not a man of good sense, good character, and good will. Meletus' ethical appeal is further diminished by his frequent reluctance to answer Socrates' pointed questions. The crowning touch was the incremental irony of Socrates' repeated reference to Meletus as "my friend"—an irony that becomes as damaging as Mark Antony's use of the epithet "honorable men" in the famous "Friends, Romans, countrymen" speech in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.

    PERICLES FUNERAL ORATION

    1 In the same winter the Athenians, following their annual custom, gave a public funeral for those who had been the first to die in the war. These funerals are held in the following way: two days before the ceremony the bones of the fallen are brought and put in a tent which has been erected, and people make whatever offerings they wish to their own dead. Then there is a funeral procession in which coffins of cypress wood are carried on wagons. There is one coffin for each tribe, which contains the bones of members of that tribe. One empty bier is decorated and carried in the procession: this is for the missing, whose bodies could not be recovered. Everyone who wishes to, both citizens and foreigners, can join in the procession, and the women who are related to the dead are there to make their laments at the tomb. The bones are laid in the public burial-place, which is in the most beautiful quarter outside the city walls. Here the Athenians always bury those who have fallen in war. The only exception is those who died at Marathon, who, because their achievement was considered absolutely outstanding, were buried on the battlefield itself.

    3 "Many of those who have spoken here in the past have praised the institution of this speech at the close of our ceremony. It seemed to them a mark of honour to our soldiers who have fallen in war that a speech should be made over them. I do not agree. These men have shown themselves valiant in action, and it would be enough, I think, for their glories to be proclaimed in action, as you have just seen it done at this funeral organized by the state. Our belief in the courage and manliness of so many should not be hazarded on the goodness or badness of one man's speech. Then it is not easy to speak with a proper sense of balance, when a man's listeners find it difficult to believe in the truth of what one is saying. The man who knows the facts and loves the dead may well think that an oration tells less than what he knows and what he would like to hear: others who do not know so much may feel envy for the dead, and think the orator over-praises them, when he speaks of exploits that are beyond their own capacities. Praise of other people is tolerable only up to a certain point, the point where one believes that one could do oneself some of the things one is hearing about. Once you get beyond this point, you will find people becoming jealous and incredulous.

    of poverty. And, just as our political life is free and open, so is our day-to-
    day life in our relations with each other. We do not get into a state with
    our next-door neighbour if he enjoys himself in his own way, nor do we
    vive him the kind of black looks which, though they do no real harm, still
    do hurt people's feelings. We are free and tolerant in our private lives; but
    in public affairs we keep to the law. This is because it commands our deep
    respect.

    7 "We give our obedience to those whom we put in positions of authority,
    and we obey the laws themselves, especially those which are for the protection
    of the oppressed, and those unwritten laws which it is an acknowledged
    shame to break.

    8 "And here is another point. When our work is over, we are in a position
    to enjoy all kinds of recreation for our spirits. There are various kinds of
    contests and sacrifices regularly throughout the year; in our own homes we
    incline a beauty and a good taste which delight us every day and which drive
    away our cares. Then the greatness of our city brings it about that all the
    good things from all the world flow in to us, so that to us it seems just as
    natural to enjoy foreign goods as our own local products.

    9 "Then there is a great difference between us and our opponents in our attitude towards military security. Here are some examples: Our city is open to the world, and we have no periodical deportations in order to prevent people from observing or finding out secrets which might be of military advantage to the enemy. This is because we rely, not on secret weapons, but on our own real courage and loyalty. There is a difference, too, in our educational systems. The Spartans, from their earliest boyhood, are subjected to the most laborious training in courage; we pass our lives without all these restrictions, and yet are just as ready to face the same dangers as they are. Here is proof of this: When the Spartans invade our land, they do not come by themselves, but bring all their allies with them; whereas we, when we launch an attack abroad, do the job ourselves, and, though fighting on foreign soil, do not often fail to defeat opponents who are fighting for their own hearths and homes. As a matter of fact, none of our enemies has ever yet been confronted with our total strength, because we have to divide our attention between our navy and the many missions on which our troops are sent on land. Yet, if our enemies engage a detachment of our forces and defeat it, they give themselves credit for having thrown back our entire army; or, if they lose, they claim that they were beaten by us in full strength. There are certain advantages, I think, in our way of meeting danger voluntarily, with an easy mind, instead of with a laborious training, with natural rather than with state-induced courage. We do not have to spend our time practising to meet sufferings which are still in the future; and when they are actually upon us, we show ourselves just as brave as these others who are always in strict training. This is one point in which, I think, our city deserves to be admired. There are also others:

    1. "Our love of what is beautiful does not lead to extravagance; our love of the things of the mind does not make us soft. We regard wealth as something to be properly used, rather than as something to boast about. As for poverty, no one need be ashamed to admit it: the real shame is in not taking practical measures to escape from it. Here each individual is interested not only in his own affairs but in the affairs of the state as well: even those who are mostly occupied with their own business are extremely well-informed on general politics—this is a peculiarity of ours: we do not say that a man who takes no interest in politics is a man who minds his own business; we say that he has no business here at all. We Athenians, in our own persons, take our decisions on policy or submit them to proper discussions: for we do not think that there is an incompatibility between words and deeds; the worst thing is to rush into action before the consequences have been properly debated. And this is another point where we differ from other people. We are capable at the same time of taking risks and of estimating them beforehand. Others are brave out of ignorance; and, when they stop to think, they begin to fear. But the man who can most truly be accounted brave is he who knows the meaning of what is sweet in life and of what is terrible, and then goes out undeterred to meet what is to come."

- prompt: "11 \"Again, in questions of general good feeling there is a great contrast  \nbetween us and most other people. We make friends by doing good to others,  \nnot by receiving good from them. This makes our friendship all the more  \nreliable, since we want to keep alive the gratitude of those who are in our  \ndebt by showing continued goodwill to them: whereas the feelings of one  \nwho owes us something lack the same enthusiasm, since he knows that, when  \nhe repays our kindness, it will be more like paying back a debt than giving  \nsomething spontaneously. We are unique in this. When we do kindnesses  \nto others, we do not do them out of any calculations of profit or loss: we do  \nthem without afterthought, relying on our free liberality. Taking everything  \ntogether then, I declare that our city is an education to Greece, and I declare  \nthat in my opinion each single one of our citizens, in all the manifold aspects  \nof life, is able to show himself the rightful lord and owner of his own per-  \nson, and do this, moreover, with exceptional grace and exceptional versatility.  \nAnd to show that this is no empty boasting for the present occasion, but  \nreal tangible fact, you have only to consider the power which our city  \npossesses and which has been won by those very qualities which I have  \nmentioned.

    dead, who are present here. Instead I shall try to comfort them. They are
    well aware that they have grown up in a world where there are many
    changes and chances. But this is good fortune—for men to end their lives
    with honour, as these have done, and for you honourably to lament them:
    their life was set to a measure where death and happiness went hand in
    hand. I know that it is difficult to convince you of this. When you see other
    people happy you will often be reminded of what used to make you happy
    too. One does not feel sad at not having some good thing which is outside
    one's experience: real grief is felt at the loss of something which one is
    used to. All the same, those of you who are of the right age must bear up
    and take comfort in the thought of having more children. In your own homes
    these new children will prevent you from brooding over those who are no
    more, and they will be a help to the city, too, both in filling the empty
    places, and in assuring her security. For it is impossible for a man to put
    forward fair and honest views about our affairs if he has not, like everyone
    else, children whose lives may be at stake. As for those of you who are
    now too old to have children, I would ask you to count as gain the greater
    part of your life, in which you have been happy, and remember that what
    remains is not long, and let your hearts be lifted up at the thought of the
    fair fame of the dead. One's sense of honour is the only thing that does

    ANALYSIS OF THE TOPICS IN ‘"‘PERICLES FUNERAL ORATION

    Pericles' noble utterance is the prototype of all memorial addresses. The death
    of loved ones or of heroes invariably calls forth generous tributes, heartfelt
    sentiments, and noble resolutions. This most emotional of all human events
    usually manages to escape the blight of sentimentality, probably because we
    the survivors feel that no expression of sentiment, however extravagant, can
    be in excess of the occasion that prompts it. There is danger, of course, that
    when time removes us from emotional involvement with the occasion and
    the deceased, elegies will strike us as being maudlin. It is the perspective of
    time that separates the deathless prose from the perishable. Lincoln's Gettys-
    burg Address and Pericles' Funeral Oration are two of the epideictic utter-
    ances that impress us as being as eloquent and genuine now as they were
    the day they were delivered from the podium.

    In the first two paragraphs of the selection, Thucydides gives us the back-
    ground for Pericles' speech. The statement that the city fathers expected "an
    appropriate speech in praise of the dead" indicates that the speech is to be
    of the epideictic variety—or, as we have chosen to call it, ceremonial. ‘This is
    to be a speech of display in which a man or group of men is to be praised
    or censured. The audience does not have to be persuaded, as in the case of
    deliberative and forensic discourse, to make a decision; the audience has
    merely to be convinced—or at least to be confirmed in its belief—that a man
    or group of men is deserving of praise or censure. There is, of course, a
    certain indirect deliberative purpose to such a speech; if the audience can
    be convinced that the men are deserving of praise it may be induced to go
    and be likewise.

    We may divide Pericles' oration into four parts:

    1. Introduction (paragraphs 3-5).

    2. Praise of the Athenian people (paragraphs 6-12).
    3. Praise of the dead heroes (paragraphs 13-16).

    4. Conclusion (paragraph 17).

- prompt: "It might strike the student as odd that Pericles should devote more of his  \nspeech to the praise of the Athenian people, past and present, than to the  \npraise of the war heroes. Pericles accounts for this proportion in paragraph  \n12, where he says, \"And it was for this reason that I have spoken at such  \nlength about our city, because I wanted to make it clear that for us there  \nis more at stake than there is for others who lack our advantages; also |  \nwanted my words of praise for the dead to be set in the bright light of  \nevidence.\" In other words, praise of the Athenian people reflects praise on  \nthe men who died in their cause, who sacrificed their own enjoyment of this  \nway of life so that others could enjoy it. \"The people who have the most  \nexcuse for despising death,\" Pericles says (paragraph 14), \"are not the  \nwretched and unfortunate, who have no hope of doing well for themselves,  \nbut those who run the risk of a complete reversal in their lives, and who  \nfeel the difference most intensely, if things went wrong for them.\" (Note  \nhow the common topic of more and less is operating here.)\n\nThe special topics for ceremonial discourse are the virtues, physical attri-  \nbutes, actions and achievements, and sayings of the men being praised; another resort is the testimony of others. Throughout the speech, Pericles  \ntouches on several of the virtues that characterize the Athenian people and  \nthe dead heroes. In reference to the former he mentions the following virtues:\n\n1. Justice (respect for the natural and legal rights of men).  \nIn our democratic government, we allow for and encourage the  \nfree exercise of the rights of citizenship (paragraph 6). In private  \ndisputes, everyone is equal before the law (paragraph 6). Our  \nday-to-day relations with one another are free and equal (para-  \ngraph 6). We obey those we have invested with authority, and  \nwe respect both written and unwritten law (paragraph 7).\n\n2. Wisdom (an intellectual virtue).  \nWe cultivate beauty and the things of the mind (paragraphs 8  \nand 10). We have an enlightened attitude toward wealth and  \npoverty (paragraph 10). We believe that all citizens should be  \nwell-informed about political affairs (paragraph 10).\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Strategies in Pericles'' Speech**\n\nPericles spends more time praising the Athenian people than the war heroes. Use the text to explain how this emphasis reflects his rhetorical strategy and the underlying values of Athenian democracy.\n- **Step 1**: Reference Pericles'' justification for this focus (paragraph 12).\n- **Step 2**: Connect his argument to the concept of ''more at stake'' (paragraph 12).\n- **Step 3**: Explain how praising the people supports the praise of the heroes, using the quote about sacrifice (paragraph 12).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly integrate the text''s mention of democracy, equality, and the relationship between citizens and heroes.

    3. Prudence (another intellectual virtue).
    We have a superior policy on military security and training (paragraph 9). We have a penchant for deliberation before rushing into action (paragraph 10). We are capable not only of taking risks but of estimating them beforehand (paragraph 10).

    4. Magnanimity and Liberality.
    We are fond of doing good to others (paragraph 11). And we do

    good to others, not out of any calculation of profit and loss to us

    but out of a generous disposition (paragraph 11). We make
    friends by doing good to others, not by receiving good from them

    (paragraph 11).

    As might be expected, the virtue that Pericles stresses as belonging to the
    soldiers in paragraphs 13-16 is courage. He also touches on their honorable-
    ness (gallantry), loyalty, and unselfishness. But as Pericles indicated in para-
    graph 3, he is more disposed to entrust the glorification of the soldiers to
    the record of their actions and achievements than to the qualities of the
    speeches made over them. As he says, "Our belief in the courage and manli-
    ness of so many should not be hazarded on the goodness or badness of one
    man's speech." All references in these paragraphs to the soldiers' actions and
    achievements are variations on the double theme that they fought gallantly
    and that they made the supreme sacrifice, their lives. There is no recital of
    the physical attributes of the men (with the possible exception of the mention
    of their manliness) or of their sayings. And the only recourse to the testi-
    mony of others is Pericles' reminder that these men have established their
    memorial in people's hearts.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Intellectual Virtues in Pericles'' Speech**\n\nPericles outlines three intellectual virtues: prudence, magnanimity, and liberality. Analyze how these virtues are exemplified in the speech''s portrayal of the soldiers'' actions and achievements.\n- **Step 1**: Define each virtue using the text''s descriptions (e.g., prudence as ''a superior policy on military security and training'').\n- **Step 2**: Identify specific examples from the text that demonstrate each virtue in the context of the soldiers'' actions.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how these virtues collectively contribute to the overall message of the speech regarding the soldiers'' legacy.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate definitions from the text and provide clear examples that show how each virtue is manifested in the soldiers'' actions.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Reasoning on the Nature of Soldiers'' Virtues**\n\nPericles emphasizes that the soldiers'' courage and manliness are to be judged by their actions rather than their speeches. Use logical reasoning based on the text to explain why this approach is more credible.\n- **Step 1**: Explain Pericles'' argument that actions establish the soldiers'' legacy (referencing paragraph 3).\n- **Step 2**: Compare this to the idea of relying on speeches for judgment, using examples from paragraphs 13-16.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a rationale for why action-based judgments are more reliable in the context of military honors.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s arguments and demonstrate a clear understanding of Pericles'' reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Virtue and Testimony**\n\nPericles'' speech discusses how the soldiers'' legacy is determined by their actions and the testimonies of others. Construct an argument that evaluates whether the soldiers'' deeds are more significant than their sayings in establishing their honor.\n- **Step 1**: Define the criteria for determining a soldier''s honor according to Pericles (referencing paragraphs 3 and 13-16).\n- **Step 2**: Compare the soldiers'' actions (gallantry, sacrifice) to their sayings (speeches).\n- **Step 3**: Propose a logical conclusion about the relative importance of actions versus words in defining honor, supported by examples from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate all relevant textual evidence and demonstrate a comprehensive analysis of Pericles'' arguments.'

    Ceremonial discourse offers more opportunity for the use of the topics of amplification and depreciation than the other two kinds of discourse.
    Frequently throughout the speech Pericles attempts to magnify the deeds and virtues of the Athenians by mentioning that the deeds and virtues were unique or were better or were more frequent or were produced under more adverse circumstances. The common topic of comparison is frequently re-sorted to in the speech. The most pronounced example of this topic is found in paragraph 9, where Pericles contrasts the military policies of Athens with those of other countries (Pericles is thinking mainly of Sparta). This comparison reveals marked differences, and in arguing where the advantage lies in these differences, Pericles resorts to some of the criteria that help one decide questions of more and less (the topic of degree). In the words addressed to the parents, the wives, the sons and brothers, of the dead men, he makes great use of the common topics of future fact. He seems to be suggesting that if the survivors do this and this, this will come to pass (future fact, in other words, is being argued with the topic of antecedent-consequent). The past facts are all confirmed by the prosperity, stature, and esteem presently enjoyed by the Athenian people.

    Pericles' oration is a classic example of how one proceeds when one seeks to praise someone, whether that praise be in a formal address like this, in a toastmaster's introductory remarks about a featured speaker, in a letter of reference, in a citation, in an obituary, in a memoir. One expatiates on those virtues, attributes, deeds, achievements, testimonies which reflect credit on the man being extolled. The same basic strategy is used when one seeks
    to discredit someone. In ceremonial discourse, perhaps more than in the other two kinds, the nature of the subject will be the major factor determin-ing what can be said, for the success of this kind of discourse depends mainly on the truth or credibility of what is said. In paragraph 3, Pericles adverted to the difficulty in executing this kind of discourse successfully:

However, it also mentions that the success of this kind of discourse depends mainly on the truth or credibility of what is said.\n- **Part A**: Explain why these two facts (more use of amplification/depreciation and dependence on truth) might seem contradictory. Use a specific example from the text to support your reasoning.\n- **Part B**: In paragraph 3, Pericles acknowledges the difficulty in executing this kind of discourse successfully. How does this difficulty relate to the balance between amplification/depreciation and truth?\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument that reconciles these two aspects: the use of rhetorical devices and the need for factual accuracy.

    Then it is not easy to speak with a proper sense of balance, when a man's
    listeners find it difficult to believe in the truth of what one is saying. The
    man who knows the facts and loves the dead may well think that an
    oration tells less than what he knows and what he would like to hear;
    others who do not know so much may feel envy for the dead, and think
    the orator over-praises them, when he speaks of exploits that are beyond
    their own capacities. Praise of other people is tolerable only up to a cer-
    tain point, the point where one believes that one could do oneself some
    of the things one is hearing about. Once you get beyond this point, you
    will find people becoming jealous and incredulous.

    The student might well take these judicious words—and the example of the
    speech itself—as his guide in the preparation of any discourse designed to
    praise or censure his fellow man.

    so strange a phenomenon as this book. Many of the greatest men that ever

    own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the
    meanest and feeblest intellect. Johnson described him as a fellow who had
    missed his only chance of immortality by not having been alive when the

    Stratford-on-Avon, with a placard round his hat bearing the inscription of

    pride and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet

    it is impossible to find a parallel in the whole history of mankind. He has
    used many people ill; but assuredly he has used nobody so ill as himself.

    3. That such a man should have written one of the best books in the world
    is strange enough. But this is not all. Many persons who have conducted
    themselves foolishly in active life and whose conversation has indicated no
    superior powers of mind have left us valuable works. Goldsmith was very
    justly described by one of his contemporaries as an inspired idiot, and by
    another as a being
    Who wrote like an angel, and talked like poor Poll.

    La Fontaine was in society a mere simpleton. His blunders would not come amiss among the stories of Hierocles. But these men attained literary eminence in spite of their weaknesses. Boswell attained it by reason of his weaknesses. If he had not been a great fool, he would never have been a great writer. Without all the qualities which made him the jest and the torment of those among whom he lived, without the officiousness, the inquisitiveness, the effrontery, the toad-eating, the insensibility to all reproof, he never could have produced so excellent a book. He was a slave, proud of his servitude; a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues; an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence; a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.

  finalExamQuestion2: 'Logical Reasoning on Literary Influence\n\nCompare Boswell''s literary legacy to that of Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and Johnson. Using the text, explain why Boswell''s "so excellent a book" is considered immeasurably superior in an important department of literature.\n- **Step 1**: Determine the key qualities of each of these writers as presented in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast Boswell''s approach to writing with that of these traditional writers.\n- **Step 3**: Use the text''s language to argue why Boswell''s work stands out despite his ''foolish'' nature.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the text''s evaluative language and demonstrate a clear comparison of literary styles and their impact.'

    4 Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. His dissertations on hereditary gentility, on the slave-trade, and on the entailing of landed estates, may serve as examples. To say that these passages are sophistical would be to pay them an extravagant compliment. They have no pretence to argument or even to meaning. He has reported innumerable observations made by himself in the course of conversation. Of those observations we do not remember one which is above the intellectual capacity of a boy of fifteen. He has printed many of his own letters, and in these letters he is always ranting or twaddling. Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.

    5 Those parts of his book which, considered abstractedly, are most utterly worthless, are delightful when we read them as illustrations of the character of the writer. Bad in themselves, they are good dramatically, like the nonsense of Justice Shallow, the clipped English of Dr. Caius, or the misplaced

J., and synthesize the author''s critique of Boswell''s literary abilities.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two specific literary qualities that the text claims Boswell lacked.\n- **Step 2**: Use examples from the passage to justify why these qualities are essential for a writer''s success.\n- **Step 3**: Compare and contrast Boswell''s lack of these qualities with the traits that make a writer valuable according to traditional rhetorical standards.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate direct evidence from the text and demonstrate an understanding of classical rhetorical values versus Boswell''s shortcomings.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Literary Criticism**\n\nExamine the passage''s assertion that ''those parts of his book which are most utterly worthless, are delightful when we read them as illustrations of the character of the writer.''\n- **Part A**: Explain why the text argues that Boswell''s writings are ''worthless'' in their own right.\n- **Part B**: Use the passage to argue that the value of a writer lies in their character, not in their writings.\n- **Part C**: Compare this reasoning to the classical definition of rhetoric as ''the art of persuasion.''

    Consonants of Fluellen. Of all confessors, Boswell is the most candid. Other
    men who have pretended to lay open their own hearts—Rousseau, for ex-
    ample, and Lord Byron—have evidently written with a constant view to
    effect and are therefore most distrusted when they seem to be most sincere.
    There is scarcely any man who would not rather accuse himself of great
    crimes and of dark and tempestuous passions than proclaim all his little
    vanities and wild fancies. It would be easier to find a person who would
    avow actions like those of Caesar Borgia or Danton, than one who would
    publish a day-dream like those of Alnaschar and Malvolio. Those weak-
    nesses which most men keep covered up in the most secret places of
    the mind, not to be disclosed to the eye of friendship or of love, were pre-
    cisely the weaknesses which Boswell paraded before all the world. He was
    perfectly frank, because the weakness of his understanding and the tumult
    of his spirits prevented him from knowing when he made himself ridiculous.
    His book resembles nothing so much as the conversation of the inmates of
    the Palace of Truth.

    6 His fame is great, and it will, we have no doubt, be lasting; but it is fame
    of a peculiar kind and indeed marvellously resembles infamy. We remember
    no other case in which the world has made so great a distinction between
    a book and its author. In general, the book and the author are considered as
    one. To admire the book is to admire the author. The case of Boswell is an
    exception, we think the only exception, to this rule. His work is universally
    allowed to be interesting, instructive, eminently original; yet it has brought
    him nothing but contempt. All the world reads it; all the world delights in
    it; yet we do not remember ever to have read or ever to have heard any
    expression of respect and admiration for the man to whom we owe so much
    instruction and amusement. While edition after edition of his book was
    coming forth, his son, as Mr. Croker tells us, was ashamed of it and hated
    to hear it mentioned. This feeling was natural and reasonable. Sir Alexander
    saw that in proportion to the celebrity of the work was the degradation of
    the author. The very editors of this unfortunate gentleman's books have for-
    gotten their allegiance, and, like those Puritan casuists who took arms by
    the authority of the king against his person, have attacked the writer while
    doing homage to the writings. Mr. Croker, for example, has published two
    thousand five hundred notes on the life of Johnson and yet scarcely ever
    mentions the biographer whose performance he has taken such pains to illus-
    trate, without some expression of contempt.

    7 An ill-natured man Boswell certainly was not. Yet the malignity of
    the most malignant satirist could scarcely cut deeper than his thoughtless
    loquacity. Having himself no sensibility to derision and contempt, he took
    it for granted that all others were equally callous. He was not ashamed to
    exhibit himself to the whole world as a common spy, a common tattler, i

    humble companion without the excuse of poverty, and to tell a hundred
    stories of his own pertness and folly, and of the insults which his pertness
    and folly brought upon him. It was natural that he should show little dis-
    cretion in cases in which the feelings or the honour of others might be con-
    cerned. No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom
    he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as
    contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some
    moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that
    Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of
    being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which
    all his views and weaknesses are exposed more unsparingly than they ever
    were exposed by Churchill or by Kenrick.

    THOMAS JEFFERSON.
    ON THE CHARACTER OF GEORGE WASHINGTON

    A letter, dated Monticello, January 2, 1814, to Walter Jones.

    Dear Sir,—

    rt Your favor of November the 25th reached this place December the 21st,
    having been near a month on the way. How this could happen I know not,
    as we have two mails a week both from Fredericksburg and Richmond. It
    found me just returned from a long journey and absence, during which so
    much business had accumulated, commanding the first attentions, that an-
    other week has been added to the delay.

Consider the following elements:\n- **Tone and Diction**: How does Jefferson''s language reflect his attitude toward the recipient and the delay in communication?\n- **Structure**: How does the structure of the letter contribute to its persuasive or informative purpose?\n- **Historical Context**: What historical circumstances might have influenced the delay in receiving Jefferson''s letter?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of classical rhetoric principles and synthesize the analysis across all three elements, using explicit references to Jefferson''s language and structure.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Interpretation of Character Portrayal**\n\nExamine the excerpt from the review of Samuel Johnson''s character. Identify and explain two rhetorical devices used to characterize Johnson, and discuss how these devices contribute to the overall assessment of his character.\n- **First Device**: The use of contrast between Johnson''s traits and his hero''s qualities.\n- **Second Device**: The irony in the claim that Johnson''s work ''degraded'' his character.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must include a clear identification of the rhetorical devices, their specific functions in the text, and how they collectively shape the reader''s perception of Johnson.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Historical and Literary Synthesis**\n\nCompare and contrast the rhetorical approaches of Thomas Jefferson and the anonymous reviewer of Samuel Johnson. Consider the following aspects:\n- **Purpose**: What is the primary purpose of each author''s writing?\n- **Tone and Style**: How do their tones and styles reflect their respective purposes?\n- **Audience**: Who is the intended audience for each text, and how does this influence their rhetorical choices?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate an analysis of both texts, highlighting the differences in rhetorical strategies and their effectiveness in achieving the authors'' goals.'

    2 I deplore, with you, the putrid state into which our newspapers have
    passed, and the malignity, the vulgarity, and mendacious spirit of those who
    write for them; and I enclose you a recent sample, the production of a New
    England judge, as a proof of the abyss of degradation into which we are
    fallen. These ordures are rapidly depraving the public taste and lessening its
    relish for sound food. As vehicle of information and a curb on our function-
    aries, they have rendered themselves useless, by forfeiting all title to belief.
    That this has, in a great degree, been produced by the violence and malignity
    of party spirit, I agree with you; and I have read with great pleasure the
    paper you enclosed me on that subject, which I now return. It is at the same
    time a perfect model of the style of discussion which candor and decency
    should observe, of the tone which renders difference of opinion even amiable,
    and a succinct, correct, and dispassionate history of the origin and progress
    of party among us. It might be incorporated as it stands, and without chang-

    I wished a little more development of a very sound and catholic idea; a single intercalation to rest it solidly on true bottom. It is near the end of the first page, where you make a statement of genuine republican maxims; saying,

    "that the people ought to possess as much political power as can possibly exist with the order and security of society." Instead of this I would say,

    "that the people, being the only safe depository of power, should exercise in person every function which their qualifications enable them to exercise, consistently with the order and security of society; that we now find them equal to the election of those who shall be invested with their executive and legislative powers, and to act themselves in the judiciary, as judges in question of fact; that the range of their powers ought to be enlarged," etc. This gives both the reason and exemplification of the maxim you express, "that they ought to possess as much political power," etc. I see nothing to correct either in your facts or principles.

    3 You say that in taking General Washington on your shoulders, to bear him harmless through the federal coalition, you encounter a perilous topic. I do not think so. You have given the genuine history of the course of his mind through the trying scenes in which it was engaged, and of the seductions by which it was deceived, but not depraved. I think I knew General Washington intimately and thoroughly; and were I called on to delineate his character, it should be in terms like these.

    4 His mind was great and powerful, without being of the very first order;
    his penetration strong, though not so acute as that of a Newton, Bacon, or
    Locke; and as far as he saw, no judgment was ever sounder. It was slow in
    operation, being little aided by invention or imagination, but sure in conclu-
    sion. Hence the common remark of his officers, of the advantage he derived
    from councils of war, where hearing all suggestions, he selected whatever
    was best; and certainly no general ever planned his battles more judiciously.
    But if deranged during the course of the action, if any member of his plan
    was dislocated by sudden circumstances, he was slow in re-adjustment. The
    consequence was that he often failed in the field, and rarely against an enemy
    in station, as at Boston and York. He was incapable of fear, meeting personal
    dangers with the calmest unconcern. Perhaps the strongest feature in his
    character was prudence, never acting until every circumstance, every con-
    sideration, was maturely weighed; refraining if he saw a doubt, but, when
    once decided, going through with his purpose, whatever obstacles opposed.
    His integrity was most pure, his justice the most inflexible I have ever known,
    no motive of interest or consanguinity, of friendship or hatred, being able
    to bias his decision. He was, indeed, in every sense of the word, a wise, a
    good, and a great man. His temper was naturally high toned; but reflection
    and resolution had obtained a firm and habitual ascendency over it. If ever,
    however, it broke its bonds, he was most tremendous in his wrath. In his

    expenses he was honorable, but exact; liberal in contributions to whatever
    promised utility; but frowning and unyielding on all visionary projects and
    all unworthy calls on his charity. His heart was not warm in its affections;
    but he exactly calculated every man's value and gave him a solid esteem
    proportioned to it. His person, you know, was fine, his stature exactly what
    one would wish, his deportment easy, erect, and noble; the best horseman
    of his age and the most graceful figure that could be seen on horseback. Al-
    though in the circle of his friends, where he might be unreserved with safety,
    he took a free share in conversation, his colloquial talents were not above
    mediocrity, possessing neither copiousness of ideas, nor fluency of words. In
    public, when called on for a sudden opinion, he was unready, short, and em-
    barrassed. Yet he wrote readily, rather diffusely, in an easy and correct style.
    This he had acquired by conversation with the world, for his education was
    merely reading, writing, and common arithmetic, to which he added sur-
    veying at a later day. His time was employed in action chiefly, reading little,
    and that only in agriculture and English history. His correspondence became
    necessarily extensive, and, with journalising his agricultural proceedings,
    occupied most of his leisure hours within doors. On the whole, his character
    was, in its mass, perfect, in nothing bad, in few points indifferent; and it
    may truly be said that never did nature and fortune combine more perfectly
    to make a man great and to place him in the same constellation with what-
    ever worthies have merited from man an everlasting remembrance. For his
    was the singular destiny and merit of leading the armies of his country suc-
    cessfully through an arduous war, for the establishment of its independence;
    of conducting its councils through the birth of a government, new in its
    forms and principles, until it had settled down into a quiet and orderly train;
    and of scrupulously obeying the laws through the whole of his career, civil
    and military, of which the history of the world furnishes no other example.

    What is the argument? I am satisfied the great body of republicans think of him as I do. We were, indeed, dissatisfied with him on his ratification of the British treaty. But this was short-lived. We know his honesty, the wiles with which he was compassed, and that age had already begun to relax the firmness of his purposes; and I am convinced he is more deeply seated in the love and gratitude of the republicans than in the pharisaical homage of the federal monarchists. For he was no monarchist from preference of his judgment. The soundness of that gave him correct views of the rights of man, and his severe justice devoted him to them. He has often declared to me that he considered our new Constitution as an experiment on the practicability of republican government, and with what dose of liberty man could be trusted for his own good; that he was determined the experiment should have a fair trial, and would lose the last drop of his blood in support of it, And these declarations

    He repeated to me the oftener and more pointedly, because he knew my suspicions of Colonel Hamilton's views, and probably had heard from him the same declarations which I had, to wit, "that the British constitution, with its unequal representation, corruption, and other existing abuses, was the most perfect government which had ever been established on earth, and that a reformation of those abuses make it an impracticable government." I do believe that General Washington had not a firm confidence in the durability of our government. He was naturally distrustful of men and inclined to gloomy apprehensions; and I was ever persuaded that a belief that we must at length end in something like a British constitution had some weight in his adoption of the ceremonies of levees, birthdays, pompous meetings with Congress, and other forms of the same character, calculated to prepare us gradually for a change which he believed possible, and to let it come on with as little shock as might be to the public mind.

    6 ‘These are my opinions of General Washington, which I would vouch at the judgment seat of God, having been formed on an acquaintance of thirty years. I served with him in the Virginia legislature from 1769 to the Revolutionary war, and again a short time in Congress, until he left us to take command of the army. During the war and after it we corresponded occasionally, and in the four years of my continuance in the office of Secretary of State, our intercourse was daily, confidential, and cordial. After I retired from that office, great and malignant pains were taken by our federal monarchists, and not entirely without effect, to make him view me as a theorist, holding French principles of government, which would lead infallibly to licentiousness and anarchy. And to this he listened the more easily, from my known disapprobation of the British treaty. I never saw him afterwards, or these malignant insinuations should have been dissipated before his just judgment, as mists before the sun. I felt on his death, with my countrymen, that "verily a great man hath fallen this day in Israel."

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Properties of Real Numbers**\n\nUsing the definitions of the properties of addition and multiplication provided in the text, simplify the expression $ 3x + 2(5 - x) $.\n- **Step 1**: Apply the distributive property to expand the terms.\n- **Step 2**: Use the associative and commutative properties to combine like terms.\n- **Step 3**: Justify each step by referencing the specific property (e.g., "The distributive property states that...").\n**Answer Requirement**: Your final simplified expression must be correct, and you must explicitly identify at least two distinct properties used in your reasoning.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rational Exponent Definitions**\n\nEvaluate $ 16^{3/4} $ using the three definitions of rational exponents provided in the text:\n- **Definition 1**: $ a^{m/n} = (a^{1/n})^m $\n- **Definition 2**: $ a^{m/n} = (a^m)^{1/n} $ \n- **Definition 3**: $ a^{m/n} = (a^m)^{1/n} $\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Compute the value using Definition 1. Show all intermediate steps, including simplifying radicals and exponents.\n- **Part B**: Verify that your result matches the value obtained using Definition 2. Explain why Definitions 1 and 2 yield the same outcome despite their different order of operations.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s repeated emphasis on equivalent forms (e.g., $ a^{m/n} = (a^m)^{1/n} $) ensures consistency in simplifying expressions with rational exponents.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate mastery of all three definitions and explicitly link their equivalence to the properties of exponents.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Number Classifications**\n\nThe text defines natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers. Consider the number $ \sqrt{16} $.\n- **Part A**: Determine which sets (natural, whole, integer, rational, or irrational) this number belongs to. Justify your answer using definitions from the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain why $ \sqrt{16} $ is not classified as an irrational number, despite involving a square root. Use logical reasoning based on the distinction between rational and irrational numbers provided in the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the claim: "All numbers with exponents are irrational." Your example must reference at least two sets from the text (e.g., integers, rationals) and clarify how they relate to exponentiation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the hierarchy of real number classifications and demonstrate an understanding of why certain numbers fall into specific categories.'

    Who was charged with having been unfaithful to his employer, and having deserted to the opposite party for a pecuniary reward—attacked very rudely in a newspaper the Reverend Mr. James Thomson, one of the ministers of that place, on account of a supposed allusion to him in one of his sermons. Upon this the minister, on a subsequent Sunday, arraigned him by name from the pulpit with some severity; and the agent, after the sermon was over, rose up and asked the minister aloud, "What bribe he had received for telling so many lies from the chair of verity." I was present at this very extraordinary scene. The person arraigned, and his father and brother, who had also had a share both of the reproof from the pulpit, and in the retaliation, brought an action against Mr. Thomson, in the Court of Session, for defamation and damages, and I was one of the counsel for the reverend defendant. The Liberty of the Pulpit was our great ground of defense: but we argued also on the provocation of the previous attack, and on the instant retaliation. The Court of Session, however, the fifteen Judges, who are at the same time the Jury, decided against the minister, contrary to my humble opinion; and several of them expressed themselves with indignation against him. He was an aged gentleman, formerly a military chaplain, and a man of high spirit and honour. Johnson was satisfied that the judgment was wrong, and dictated to me the following argument in confutation of it:—

    2 "Of the censure pronounced from the pulpit, our determination must be
    formed, as in other cases, by a consideration of the action itself, and the par-

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Defense Strategies**\n\nUsing the text provided, outline a logical argument to defend the Reverend Mr. Thomson against the charges of defamation and damages. Your response should integrate the following elements:\n- **Step 1**: Reference the ''Liberty of the Pulpit'' as a foundational legal and moral principle.\n- **Step 2**: Justify the minister''s reprimand as a form of ''instant retaliation'' for prior defamation.\n- **Step 3**: Argue that the Court of Session''s decision was unjust, citing the judges'' expressions of indignation against the minister.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be structured as a coherent defense, referencing the text''s mention of ''the Liberty of the Pulpit'' and ''the instant retaliation,'' while also addressing the judges'' sentiments.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Rhetorical Context and Legal Precedent**\n\nExplain how the text''s description of the minister''s actions (the previous attack, the reprimand, and the retaliation) illustrates the principle of ''provocation'' in legal arguments.\n- **Part A**: Define ''provocation'' as it applies to the minister''s reprimand.\n- **Part B**: Use the text to explain how the Court of Session''s decision contradicts the principle of ''provocation.''\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how this case might influence future legal interpretations of ''provocation'' in defamation cases.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the text''s events and link them to broader legal concepts of provocation in defamation law.'

    3 "The right of censure and rebuke seems necessarily appendant to the
    pastoral office. He, to whom the care of a congregation is entrusted, is con-
    sidered as the shepherd of a flock, as the teacher of a school, as the father of
    a family. As a shepherd tending not his own sheep but those of his master,
    he is answerable for those that stray, and that lose themselves by straying.
    But no man can be answerable for losses which he has not power to prevent,
    or for vagrancy which he has not authority to restrain.

    4 "As a teacher giving instruction for wages, and liable to reproach, if
    those whom he undertakes to inform make no proficiency, he must have the
    power of enforcing attendance, of awakening negligence, and repressing
    contradiction.

    5 "As a father, he possesses the paternal authority of admonition, rebuke,
    and punishment. He cannot, without reducing his office to an empty name,
    be hindered from the exercise of any practice necessary to stimulate the idle,
    to reform the vicious, to check the petulant, and correct the stubborn.

    6 "If we enquire into the practice of the primitive Church, we shall, I be-
    lieve, find the ministers of the word exercising the whole authority of this
    complicated character. We shall find them not only encouraging the good
    by exhortation, but terrifying the wicked by reproof and denunciation. In
    the earliest ages of the Church, while religion was yet pure from secular
    advantages, the punishment of sinners was publick censure, and open pen-
    ance; penalties inflicted merely by ecclesiastical authority, at a time while the
    Church had yet no help from the civil power; while the hand of the magis-
    trate lifted only the rod of persecution; and when governours were ready to
    afford a refuge to all those who fled from clerical authority.

    7 "That the Church, therefore, had once a power of publick censure is evi-
    dent, because that power was frequently exercised. That it borrowed not its
    power from the civil authority, is likewise certain, because civil authority was
    at that time its enemy.

    8 "The hour came at length, when after three hundred years of struggle and distress, Truth took possession of imperial power, and the civil laws lent their aid to the ecclesiastical constitutions. The magistrate from that time co-operated with the priest, and clerical sentences were made efficacious by secular force. But the State, when it came to the assistance of the Church, had no intention to diminish its authority. Those rebukes and those censures which were lawful before, were lawful still. But they had hitherto operated only upon voluntary submission. The refractory and contemptuous were at first in no danger of temporal severities, except what they might suffer from the reproaches of conscience, or the detestation of their fellow Christians. When religion obtained the support of law, if admonitions and censures had no effect, they were seconded by the magistrates with coercion and punishment.

    g "It therefore appears from ecclesiastical history, that the right of inflicting shame by publick censure, has been always considered as inherent in the Church; and that this right was not conferred by the civil power; for it was exercised when the civil power operated against it. By the civil power it was never taken away; for the Christian magistrate interposed his office, not to rescue sinners from censure, but to supply more powerful means of reform; to add pain where shame was insufficient; and when men were proclaimed unworthy of the society of the faithful, to restrain them by imprisonment, from spreading abroad the contagion of wickedness.

    ro "It is not improbable that from this acknowledged power of publick censure, grew in time the practice of auricular confession. Those who dreaded the blast of publick reprehension, were willing to submit themselves to the priest, by a private accusation of themselves; and to obtain a reconciliation with the Church by a kind of clandestine absolution and invisible penance; conditions with which the priest would in times of ignorance and corruption easily comply, as they increased his influence, by adding the knowledge of secret sins to that of notorious offences, and enlarged his authority, by making him the sole arbiter of the terms of reconciliation.

    From this bondage the Reformation set us free. The minister has no longer power to press into the retirement of conscience, to torture us by interrogatories, or put himself in possession of our secrets and our lives. But though we have thus controlled his usurpations, his just and original power remains unimpaired. He may still see, though he may not pry: he may yet hear, though he may not question. And that knowledge which his eyes and ears force upon him it is still his duty to use, for the benefit of his flock. A father who lives near a wicked neighbour, may forbid a son to frequent his company. A minister who has in his congregation a man of open and scandalous wickedness, may warn his parishioners to shun his conversation. To warn them is not only lawful, but not to warn them would be criminal. He may warn them one by one in friendly converse, or by a parochial visitation. But if he may warn each man singly, what shall forbid him to warn them altogether? Of that which is to be made known to all, how is there any difference whether it be communicated to each singly, or to all together? What is known to all, must necessarily be publick. Whether it shall be publick at once, or publick by degrees, is the only question. And of a sudden and solemn publication the impression is deeper, and the warning more effectual.

    12 "It may easily be urged, if a minister be thus left at liberty to delate sinners from the pulpit, and to publish at will the crimes of a parishioner, he may often blast the innocent, and distress the timorous. He may be suspicious, and condemn without evidence; he may be rash, and judge without examination; he may be severe, and treat slight offences with too much harshness; he may be malignant and partial, and gratify his private interest or resentment under the shelter of his pastoral character.

    against the crimes which publick elections frequently produce. His warning
    was felt by one of his parishioners, as pointed particularly at himself. But
    instead of producing, as might be wished, private compunction and imme-
    diate reformation, it kindled only rage and resentment. He charged his min-
    ister, in a publick paper, with scandal, defamation, and falsehood. The min-
    ister, thus reproached, had his own character to vindicate, upon which his
    pastoral authority must necessarily depend. To be charged with a defamatory
    lie is an injury which no man patiently endures in common life. To be
    charged with polluting the pastoral office with scandal and falsehood, was a
    violation of character still more atrocious, as it affected not only his personal
    but his clerical veracity. His indignation naturally rose in proportion to his
    honesty, and with all the fortitude of injured honesty, he dared this calum-
    niator in the church, and at once exonerated himself from censure, and res-
    cued his flock from deception and from danger. The man whom he accuses
    pretends not to be innocent; or at least only pretends; for he declines a trial.
    The crime of which he is accused has frequent opportunities and strong
    temptations. It has already spread far, with much depravation of private
    morals, and much injury to publick happiness. To warn the people, there-
    fore, against it was not wanton and officious, but necessary and pastoral.

    15 "What then is the fault with which this worthy minister is charged?
    He has usurped no dominion over conscience. He has exerted no authority
    in support of doubtful and controverted opinions. He has not dragged into
    light a bashful and corrigible sinner. His censure was directed against a
    breach of morality, against an act which no man justifies. The man who
    appropriated this censure to himself, is evidently and notoriously guilty. His
    consciousness of his own wickedness incited him to attack his faithful re-
    prover with open insolence and printed accusations. Such an attack made
    defence necessary; and we hope it will be at last decided that the means of
    defence were just and lawful."

    1 Among the numerous advantages promised by a well-constructed Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate, as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. He will not fail, therefore, to set a due value on any plan which, without violating the principles to which he is attached, provides a proper cure for it. The instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public councils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished; as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declamations. The valuable improvements made by the constitutions on the popular models, both ancient and modern, cannot certainly be too much admired; but it would be an unwarrantable partiality to contend that they have as effectually obviated the danger on this side, as was wished and expected. Complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens, equally the friends of public and private faith, and of public and personal liberty, that our governments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority. However anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no foundation, the evidence of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in some degree true. It will be found, indeed, on a candid review of our situation, that some of the distresses under which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operations of our governments; but it will be found, at the same time, that other causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes; and, particularly, for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public engagements and alarm for private rights, which are echoed from one end of the continent to the other. These must be chiefly, if not wholly, effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations.

    2 By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to
    a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some
    common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citi-
    zens or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.

    3 There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by
    removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects.

    4 There are again two methods of removing the causes of faction: the one,
    by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence; the other, by
    giving to every citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same
    interests.

    5 It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy, that it was
    worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment
    without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less folly to abolish
    liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than
    it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life,
    because it imparts to fire its destructive agency.

    6 The second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise. As
    long as the reason of man continues fallible, and he is at liberty to exercise
    it, different opinions will be formed. As long as the connection subsists be-
    tween his reason and his self-love, his opinions and his passions will have a
    reciprocal influence on each other; and the former will be objects to which
    the latter will attach themselves. The diversity in the faculties of men, from
    which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to
    a uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object
    of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of
    acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property
    immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and
    views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into dif-
    ferent interests and parties.

    7 'The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and we
    see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity, according to
    the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for different opinions con-
    cerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of
    speculation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously
    contending for pre-eminence and power; or to persons of other descriptions
    whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have, in turn,
    divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and
    rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to
    cooperate for their own common good. So strong is this propensity of man-
    kind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion pre-
    sents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient
    to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. But
    the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and
    unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are with-
    out property have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those who are
    creditors and those who are debtors fall under a like discrimination. A landed
    interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest,
    with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and
    divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views.
    The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal
    task of modern legislation and involves the spirit of party and faction in the
    necessary and ordinary operations of the government.

    8 No man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his integrity. With equal, nay with greater reason, a body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens? And what are the different classes of legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they determine? Is a law proposed concerning private debts? It is a question to which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the other. Justice ought to hold the balance between them. Yet the parties are, and must be, themselves the judges; and the most numerous party, or, in other words, the most powerful faction must be expected to prevail. Shall domestic manufactures be encouraged, and in what degree, by restrictions on foreign manufactures? are questions which would be differently decided by the landed and the manufacturing classes, and probably by neither with a sole regard to justice and the public good. The apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is an act which seems to require the most exact impartiality; yet there is, perhaps, no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a predominant party to trample on the rules of justice. Every shilling with which they overburden the inferior number, is a shilling saved to their own pockets.

    g It is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests and render them all subservient to the public good. Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm. Nor, in many cases, can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view indirect and remote considerations, which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole.

    10 The inference to which we are brought is that the causes of faction cannot be removed and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its effects.

'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analytical Reasoning on Factional Conflict**\n\nThe text asserts that factions are inevitable in legislation and that their effects must be controlled.

    If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution. When a majority is included in a faction, the form of popular government, on the other hand, enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens. To secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction, and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government, is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed. Let me add that it is the great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored, and be recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind.

    12 By what means is this object attainable? Evidently by one of two only. Either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented, or the majority, having such coexistent passion or interest, must be rendered, by their number and local situation, unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression. If the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide, we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control. They are not found to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals, and lose their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together, that is, in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful.

    13 From this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy, by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction. A common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication and concert result from the form of government itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions.

    14 A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect and promises the cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy, and we shall comprehend both the nature of the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the Union.

    15 The two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are: first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.

    16 The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand, to refine and enlarge
    the public views, by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of
    citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country,
    and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to
    temporary or partial considerations. Under such a regulation, it may well
    happen that the public voice, pronounced by the representatives of the people,
    will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people
    themselves, convened for the purpose. On the other hand, the effect may be
    inverted. Men of factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs,
    may, by intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages,
    and then betray the interests, of the people. The question resulting is,
    whether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election of
    proper guardians of the public weal; and it is clearly decided in favor of the
    latter by two obvious considerations:

    17 In the first place, it is to be remarked that, however large it may be,
    they must be limited to a certain number, in order to guard against the con-
    fusion of a multitude. Hence, the number of representatives in the two cases
    not being in proportion to that of the two constituents and being proportion-
    ally greater in the small republic, it follows that, if the proportion of fit char-
    acters be not less in the large than in the small republic, the former will
    present a greater option, and consequently a greater probability of a fit
    choice.

    18 In the next place, as each representative will be chosen by a greater num-
    ber of citizens in the large than in the small republic, it will be more difficult
    for unworthy candidates to practice with success the vicious arts by which
    elections are too often carried; and the suffrages of the people being more
    free, will be more likely to center in men who possess the most attractive merit
    and the most diffusive and established characters.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Representative Selection in Republics**\n\nCompare and contrast the two considerations provided in the text regarding the advantages of small republics for selecting proper guardians of the public weal.\n- **Consideration 1**: The limitation of representatives to a certain number prevents confusion in large republics.\n- **Consideration 2**: The larger electorate in a small republic makes it harder for unworthy candidates to win.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain how these considerations support the conclusion that small republics are more favorable for selecting proper guardians.\n- **Part B**: Use logical reasoning to argue why a small republic''s larger electorate (as opposed to a large republic''s smaller electorate) reduces the likelihood of corrupt elections.\n- **Part C**: Draw a parallel between this reasoning and modern democratic systems, where representation is often limited to prevent tyranny of the majority.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both considerations and demonstrate an understanding of how they lead to the conclusion about small republics.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Political Representation and Corruption**\n\nThe text suggests that in small republics, the number of representatives is proportionally greater than in large republics. Using this idea:\n- **Part A**: Calculate the number of representatives in a small republic with 100,000 citizens and a large republic with 1,000,000 citizens, assuming the ratio of representatives to citizens is 1:500.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the greater number of representatives in a small republic may lead to a better chance of selecting ''fit characters'' (qualified individuals) as representatives.\n- **Part C**: Apply this logic to a modern political scenario, such as the U.S. Senate versus the House of Representatives, and explain how the text''s reasoning supports or contradicts current practices.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must show clear mathematical reasoning and draw a relevant modern analogy.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Election Integrity**\n\nThe text states that in a small republic, the suffrages of the people are more free and likely to center in men with ''attractive merit'' and ''diffusive and established characters.''\n- **Part A**: Define what is meant by ''attractive merit'' and ''diffusive and established characters'' in the context of political representatives.\n- **Part B**: Use logical reasoning to argue why a larger electorate (as in a small republic) makes it more difficult for unworthy candidates to gain influence through ''vicious arts.''\n- **Part C**: Critique the text''s assumption that a small republic is inherently more virtuous. Consider potential counterarguments, such as the possibility of corruption in small communities or the effectiveness of manipulation in large republics.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an ability to analyze the text''s reasoning and provide a balanced critique.'

    1. It must be confessed that in this, as in most other cases, there is a mean,
    on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie. By enlarging too
    much the number of electors, you render the representative too little ac-
    quainted with all their local circumstances and lesser interests; as by reducing
    it too much, you render him unduly attached to these and too little fit to com-
    prehend and pursue great national objects. The federal Constitution forms
    a happy combination in this respect; the great and aggregate interests being
    referred to the national, the local and particular to the State legislatures.

    20. The other point of difference is the greater number of citizens and ex-
    tent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican
    than of democratic government; and it is this circumstance principally which
    renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former than in the
    latter. The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties
    and interests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and interests, the
    more frequently will a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller
    the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the com-
    pass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and exe-
    cute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater
    variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of
    the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens;
    or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel
    it to discover their own strength and to act in unison with each other. Besides
    other impediments, it may be remarked that, where there is a consciousness

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing the Balance of Power in Government**\n\nThe text discusses the balance between large and small republics, emphasizing how a larger republic can better manage factional conflicts.\n- **Task A**: Identify two key reasons why a larger republic is more effective at controlling factional conflicts than a smaller one. Use specific quotes from the text to support your answer.\n- **Task B**: Explain how this concept of balance applies to the federal Constitution as described in the first paragraph. Use logical reasoning based on the text''s discussion of local vs. national interests.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference the text directly and demonstrate an understanding of the author''s argument about governance structures.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluating the Role of Representation**\n\nThe text argues that representatives in a larger republic are more likely to have enlightened views and virtuous sentiments, making them better suited to govern.\n- **Task A**: Compare and contrast the role of representatives in a large republic versus a small one, based on the text''s discussion of local vs. national interests.\n- **Task B**: Construct an argument that explains why a larger republic''s representative system is more robust against factional manipulation. Your reasoning must include the text''s explanation about how a larger sphere reduces the likelihood of a majority with a common motive.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s reasoning about representation and faction control.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesizing the Concept of Faction Management**\n\nThe text presents a complex argument about how different government sizes affect the management of factional conflicts.\n- **Task A**: Summarize the author''s main argument about why a large republic is better at managing factional conflicts than a small one. Use the text''s key points about the number of parties and interests.\n- **Task B**: Apply this reasoning to a modern political system. Create a hypothetical scenario where the principles discussed in the text could be used to analyze and manage political factions. Your scenario must reference at least two of the text''s key ideas (e.g., the role of representation, the effect of population size on faction formation).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the text''s argument and its real-world applicability.'

    Dice and to schemes of injustice? It will not be denied that the representation of the Union will be most likely to possess these requisite endowments. Does it consist in the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties, against the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest? In an equal degree does the increased variety of parties comprised within the Union increase this security. Does it, in fine, consist in the greater obstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority? Here, again, the extent of the Union gives it the most palpable advantage.

    22 The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils against any danger from that source. A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union than a particular member of it; in the same proportion as such a malady is more likely to taint a particular country or district than an entire State.

    23 In the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government. And according to the degree of pleasure and pride we feel in being republicans, ought to be our zeal in cherishing the spirit and supporting the character of Federalists.

    3 I really am at a loss to draw any sort of parallel between the public merits
    of his Grace, by which he justifies the grants he holds, and these services of
    mine, on the favourable construction of which I have obtained what his
    Grace so much disapproves. In private life, I have not at all the honour of
    acquaintance with the noble Duke. But I ought to presume, and it costs me
    nothing to do so, that he abundantly deserves the esteem and love of all who
    live with him. But as to public service, why truly it would not be more ridic-
    ulous for me to compare myself in rank, in fortune, in splendid descent, in
    youth, strength, or figure, with the Duke of Bedford, than to make a parallel
    between his services and my attempts to be useful to my country. It would
    not be gross adulation, but uncivil irony, to say that he has any public merit
    of his own to keep alive the idea of the services by which his vast landed
    pensions were obtained. My merits, whatever they are, are original and per-
    sonal; his are derivative. It is his ancestor, the original pensioner, that has
    laid up this inexhaustible fund of merit, which makes his Grace so very
    delicate and exceptious about the merit of all other grantees of the Crown.
    Had he permitted me to remain in quiet, I should have said, 'tis his estate;
    that's enough. It is his by law; what have I to do with it or its history? He
    would naturally have said on his side, 'tis this man's fortune—He is as good

    4 Why will his Grace, by attacking me, force me reluctantly to compare
    my little merit with that which obtained from the Crown those prodigies of
    profuse donation, by which he tramples on the mediocrity of humble and
    laborious individuals? I would willingly leave him to the herald's college,
    which the philosophy of the sans culottes (prouder by far than all the Gar-
    ters, and Norroys, and Clarencieux, and Rouge Dragons, that ever pranced
    in a procession of what his friends call aristocrats and despots) will abolish
    with contumely and scorn. These historians, recorders, and blazoners of vir-
    tues and arms, differ wholly from that other description of historians, who
    ever assign any act of politicians to a good motive. These gentle historians,
    on the contrary, dip their pens in nothing but the milk of human kindness.
    They seek no further for merit than the preamble of a patent or the inscrip-
    tion on a tomb. With them every man created a peer is first a hero ready
    made. They judge of every man's capacity for office by the offices he has
    filled; and the more offices the more ability. Every general officer with them
    is a Marlborough; every statesman a Burleigh; every judge a Murray or a
    Yorke. They who, alive, were laughed at or pitied by all their acquaintance,
    make as good a figure as the best of them in the pages of Guillim, Edmond-
    son, and Collins.

    5 To these recorders, so full of good nature to the great and prosperous, I
    would willingly leave the first Baron Russell, and Earl of Bedford, and the
    merits of his grants. But the aulnager, the weigher, the meter of grants, will
    not suffer us to acquiesce in the judgment of the prince reigning at the time
    when they were made. They are never good to those who earn them. Well
    then; since the new grantees have war made on them by the old, and that the
    word of the sovereign is not to be taken, let us turn our eyes to history, in
    which great men have always a pleasure in contemplating the heroic origin
    of their house.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Techniques**\n\nIn the text, the author uses various rhetorical strategies to challenge the traditional aristocracy. Identify and explain three distinct rhetorical devices used in the passage, providing specific examples from the text to support your analysis.\n- **Example 1**: The author''s comparison of ''the philosophy of the sans culottes'' to ''the Garlands, Norroys, and Clarencieux'' demonstrates a **[rhetorical device]**.\n- **Example 2**: The metaphor of ''dipping their pens in nothing but the milk of human kindness'' exemplifies a **[rhetorical device]**.\n- **Example 3**: The contrast between ''historians who assign any act of politicians to a good motive'' and ''gentle historians'' illustrates a **[rhetorical device]**.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must explicitly name the rhetorical devices and link them to the specific examples provided in the text.'

    6 ‘The first peer of the name, the first purchaser of the grants, was a Mr.
    Russell, a person of an ancient gentleman's family raised by being a minion
    of Henry the Eighth. As there generally is some resemblance of character
    to create these relations, the favourite was in all likelihood much such an-
    other as his master. The first of those immoderate grants was not taken from
    the ancient demesne of the Crown, but from the recent confiscation of the
    ancient nobility of the land. The lion having sucked the blood of his prey,
    threw the offal carcass to the jackal in waiting. Having tasted once the food
    of confiscation, the favourites became fierce and ravenous. This worthy
    favourite's first grant was from the lay nobility. The second, infinitely im-
    proving on the enormity of the first, was from the plunder of the church.
    In truth his Grace is somewhat excusable for his dislike to a grant like mine,
    not only in its quantity, but in its kind so different from his own.

    7 Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the
    Eighth.

    8 Mine had not its fund in the murder of any innocent person of illustrious
    rank or in the pillage of any body of unoffending men. His grants were
    from the aggregate and consolidated funds of judgments iniquitously legal
    and from possessions voluntarily surrendered by the lawful proprietors, with
    the gibbet at their door.

    9 The merit of the grantee whom he derives from was that of being a
    prompt and greedy instrument of a levelling tyrant, who oppressed all de-
    scriptions of his people, but who fell with particular fury on everything that
    was great and noble. Mine has been, in endeavouring to screen every man,
    in every class, from oppression, and particularly in defending the high and
    eminent, who in the bad times of confiscating princes, confiscating chief gov
    ernors, or confiscating demagogues, are the most exposed to jealousy, avarice,

    Merit, but King Henry the Eighth? Indeed, he will pardon me; he is a little mistaken; all virtue did not end in the first Earl of Bedford. All discernment did not lose its vision when his Creator closed his eyes. Let him remit his rigor on the disproportion between merit and reward in others, and they will make no inquiry into the origin of his fortune. They will regard with much more satisfaction, as he will contemplate with infinitely more advantage, whatever in his pedigree has been dulcified by an exposure to the influence of heaven in a long flow of generations, from the hard, acidulous, metallic tincture of the spring. It is little to be doubted that several of his forefathers in that long series have degenerated into honour and virtue. Let the Duke of Bedford (I am sure he will) reject with scorn and horror the counsels of the lecturers, those wicked panders to avarice and ambition, who would tempt him, in the troubles of his country, to seek another enormous fortune from the forfeitures of another nobility and the plunder of another church. Let him (and I trust that yet he will) employ all the energy of his youth and all the resources of his wealth to crush rebellious principles which have no foundation in morals and rebellious movements that have no provocation in tyranny.

    17 Then will be forgot the rebellions, which, by a doubtful priority in crime,
    his ancestor had provoked and extinguished. On such a conduct in the noble
    Duke, many of his countrymen might, and with some excuse might, give
    way to the enthusiasm of their gratitude and, in the dashing style of some of
    the old declaimers, cry out that if the fates had found no other way in which
    they could give a Duke of Bedford and his opulence as props to a tottering
    world, then the butchery of the Duke of Buckingham might be tolerated;
    it might be regarded even with complacency, whilst in the heir of confisca-
    tion they saw the sympathizing comforter of the martyrs who suffered under
    the cruel confiscation of this day; whilst they behold with admiration his
    zealous protection of the virtuous and loyal nobility of France and his manly
    support to his brethren, the yet standing nobility and gentry of his native
    land. Then his Grace's merit would be pure, and new, and sharp, as fresh
    from the mint of honour. As he pleased he might reflect honour on his prede-
    cessors or throw it forward on those who were to succeed him. He might
    be the propagator of the stock of honour, or the root of it, as he thought proper.

    ment and every liberal accomplishment, would not have shown himself in-
    ferior to the Duke of Bedford or to any of those whom he traces in his line.
    His Grace very soon would have wanted all plausibility in his attack upon
    that provision which belonged more to mine than to me. He would soon

    I have scattered about me. I am stripped of all my honours, I am torn up by the roots and lie prostrate on the earth! There, and prostrate there, I most unfeignedly recognize the Divine justice and in some degree submit to it. But whilst I humble myself before God, I do not know that it is forbidden to repel the attacks of unjust and inconsiderate men. The patience of Job is proverbial. After some of the convulsive struggles of our irritable nature, he submitted himself and repented in dust and ashes. But even so, I do not find him blamed for reprehending, and with a considerable degree of verbal asperity, those ill-natured neighbours of his, who visited his dunghill to read moral, political, and economical lectures on his misery. I am alone. I have none to meet my enemies in the gate. Indeed, my Lord, I greatly deceive myself, if in this hard season I would give a peck of refuse wheat for all that is called fame and honour in the world. This is the appetite but of a few. It is a luxury, it is a privilege, it is an indulgence for those who are at their ease. But we are all of us made to shun disgrace, as we are made to shrink from pain and poverty and disease. It is an instinct; and under the direction of reason, instinct is always in the right. I live in an inverted order. They who ought to have succeeded me are gone before me. They who should have been to me as posterity are in the place of ancestors. I owe to the dearest relation (which ever must subsist in memory) that act of piety, which he would have performed to me; I owe it to him to show that he was not descended, as the Duke of Bedford would have it, from an unworthy parent.

    had been convicted of murdering Frederick A. Parmenter and Alessandro
    Barardelli during a holdup of a shoe factory in South Braintree, Massachusetts, on April 15, 1920. The editorial was probably written by Walter Lippmann, who was at the time the chief editorial-writer for The World. Despite
    the storm of controversy that raged for seven years over this celebrated case,
    Sacco and Vanzetti were executed on August 23, 1927. This excerpt is quoted

    1 Although the courts have yet to rule on all phases of the Sacco-Vanzetti
    case, we respectfully remind the Governor of Massachusetts once more that
    nothing which has been decided by the courts or by his Advisory Committee
    automatically fixes the sentence of death as the only possible conclusion. The
    236 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    exaction of the death penalty is not finally a judicial question, but a question
    of public policy which has to be settled within the discretion of the Executive.
    The jury at the original trial brought in a verdict of guilty. The presiding
    judge at that trial has repeatedly denied motions for a new trial. The Appel-
    late Courts have decided that the rulings of this judge were according to law.
    The Advisory Committee concluded that the two men are guilty. But no
    one has yet passed finally on the question as to whether the highest interests
    of the State demand that the two men be executed or that they be imprisoned
    for life. That is a question for the Governor, which he must decide not on
    the basis of whether he thinks the men are guilty but on the basis of whether
    he thinks, given all the circumstances, that an irrevocable sentence of death
    is wise.

    2 Gov. Fuller has stated publicly in another connection that he regards the
    death penalty as the one form of punishment most calculated to deter the
    professional criminal. With that opinion we for our part are in sympathy,
    and it is not our practice in clear cases of premeditated murder to plead for
    clemency. But because we share Gov. Fuller's opinion as to the theory of
    capital punishment we recognize that certain conditions must be fulfilled
    before the exaction of the penalty can have the deterrent effect which it
    ought to have. There must be no doubt in the minds of the community that
    the condemned had an absolutely unprejudiced trial. There must be no
    doubt that the condemned is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Above all,
    the circumstances must be such that the condemned dies in the role of a
    convicted criminal, and not in the role of a martyr.

    3 These elemental conditions have not been fulfilled, we submit, in the case
    of Sacco and Vanzetti. There remains in the minds of uncounted multitudes
    the gravest doubt as to whether they have had an absolutely unprejudiced
    trial on all the available evidence. This doubt, far from being reduced, has
    been augmented by the findings of the Advisory Committee that the pre-
    siding judge, who was also the reviewing judge, committed a grave breach
    of official decorum. The inquiry by the committee, which we were among
    the first to recognize as disinterested in its purposes, has plainly failed to
    carry conviction. There can be no question, therefore, that if Sacco and
    Vanzetti die on Monday night multitudes will regard their death not as a
    just penalty for a brutal crime but as a martyrdom. No one who believes in
    the deterrent effect of the death penalty can say that such an execution is
    calculated to produce the effect for which it is designed.

    4 We recognize perfectly well that no government can with self-respect
    yield to the clamor of ignorance and sentimentality and partisanship. We
    realize perfectly well how much more difficult it is for the Governor to
    commute these sentences in the face of organized threats and of sporadic

    Council to choose the wiser course. It will take that kind of greatness which
    lifts men above the passions of the moment, makes them impervious to the
    threats of their enemies and the outcry of their own partisans, and arms
    them with a resolution to take that course which the sober judgment of
    history will vindicate.

    5 If Gov. Fuller commutes these sentences the Communists and Anarchists
    will shout that they coerced him. They will make the most of it for a day,
    a week, a month. The extremists on the other side will call him a weakling,
    and sneer. But in the meantime moderate and disinterested opinion, which
    is never very talkative, will mobilize behind him and will recognize that he
    did a wise and a brave thing which can have no other result in the long run
    than to protect the prestige of the State and to deepen the confidence of the
    people in its wisdom.

    6 Therefore we plead with the Governor to see this matter in the light
    not of to-day and to-morrow but of the years to come. We plead with him
    to stay the execution because it will defeat the only purpose for which the
    death penalty can be exacted. We plead with him to remember that, however
    certain he may be in his own mind that the two men are guilty, no such
    certainty exists in the minds of his fellow-citizens. They are in doubt. They
    are troubled. We feel sure we speak for a multitude whose loyalty and dis-
    interestedness are beyond all question when we say that the guilt of Sacco
    and Vanzetti has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

    7 To the question of Sacco's cap the Lowell committee attaches great im-
    portance. To the same point great importance was attached by the prosecu-
    tion at the original trial. For when the prosecuting attorney summed up his
    case he said to the jury of this cap:

    It is absolutely condemnatory of this defendant. No, not absolutely, but
    it clinches on top of all the other circumstances.

    A cap is found on the ground near the body of the man he is accused of killing which bears a resemblance in color and general appearance to those he was in the habit of wearing, and when tried on in court it fitted—that is, his head was the size of one of the men who did the shooting.

    Let us see.

    238 § DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    g The question of identifying this cap as one of Sacco's caps came up three
    times in the trial, and only three. It came up once more in testimony before
    the Lowell committee. Anything the Lowell committee knows about this
    cap, anything anybody knows about this cap, must be drawn from these
    four sources. For there is no other evidence, and never has been.

    1o First, the three references to the cap during the trial:

    11 Mrs. Sacco, wife of the defendant, takes the stand. The prosecuting
    attorney asks her (Record, p. 1085) if her husband ever had a cap like this
    cap that was found at the murder scene. She says:

    My husband never wore caps with anything around for his ears, never,
    because he never liked it and because, besides that, never, he never wore
    them because he don't look good in them, positively.

    12 The prosecuting attorney goes on to point out marks on the cap and

    holes in the lining (Record, p. 1085).

    Q. Did you ever see a mark like this (indicating), you might or might
    not, but did you ever see a hole like that (indicating) in your husband's
    cap?
    A. Not that I remember. I never seen holes in my husband's cap like
    that.

    This ends Mrs. Sacco's evidence about the cap.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Logical Reasoning in Criminal Evidence**\n\nIn the trial described, the prosecution argues that the cap found at the murder scene is one of Sacco''s caps. Analyze the evidence presented by Mrs. Sacco and the implications for the case:\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least two pieces of evidence presented by Mrs. Sacco that support or challenge the claim that the cap belongs to Sacco.\n- **Step 2**: Evaluate whether the prosecution''s argument relies on logical reasoning or circumstantial evidence. Justify your answer by referencing the text''s discussion of argument discovery in Chapter 238.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a counterargument that the defense could use to challenge the prosecution''s claim, based on the limitations of evidence in criminal trials.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate the text''s principles of argument discovery and demonstrate an understanding of how evidence is used to build or challenge a case.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Reasoning in Legal Contexts**\n\nThe text discusses the discovery of arguments in legal proceedings. Consider the three references to the cap during the trial:\n- **Part A**: How does the repetition of the cap''s identification in the trial (three times) serve as a rhetorical device? Explain its purpose and impact on the prosecution''s case.\n- **Part B**: Using the text''s definition of argument discovery, evaluate whether the prosecution has effectively used this evidence to establish a logical connection between the cap and Sacco.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s discussion of argument discovery applies to real-world legal cases. Provide an example from contemporary law or rhetoric that demonstrates the same principles.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a deep understanding of rhetorical strategies in legal arguments and their application to the case described.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Evidence in Criminal Trials**\n\nThe cap found at the scene is a key piece of evidence. Analyze its significance in the context of the trial:\n- **Part A**: Based on the text, explain how the prosecution''s reliance on this cap as evidence is consistent with or inconsistent with the principles of argument discovery discussed in Chapter 238.\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument that the defense could use to challenge the prosecution''s case, using logical reasoning and the text''s principles of argument discovery.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the ethical implications of using circumstantial evidence in criminal trials, referencing the text''s discussion of argument discovery and logical reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s principles of argument discovery and demonstrate an ability to apply them to real-world legal scenarios.'

    13 Then there is Sacco himself on the witness-stand. His attorney asks him
    (Record, p. 908) if this is his cap. He answers, "No, sir." His attorney asks
    him (Record, p. 909) if he ever had a cap of any color made in the form of
    this cap with a fur lining, and he answers, "Never in my life." He is asked
    to try the cap on (Record, p. 909), does try it on, and says, "Could not go in.
    My size is 744." He is asked (Record, p. 910) if he knows anything about
    the history of this cap, and replies, "No, sir."

    14 Then the prosecuting attorney takes Sacco for cross-examination. He is
    asked again to try putting the cap on (Record, p. 978), tries putting it on,
    and the following passage occurs in the testimony:

    A. Can't go in.
    Q. Can't go in?
    A. No.

    Q. Try and pull it down in back and see if it can't go in?
    A. Oh, but it is too tight.

    15 The prosecuting attorney goes on to point out holes in the lining of the
    cap. He establishes the fact (Record, p. 979) that Sacco was in the habit of
    hanging his own cap on a nail in the factory where he worked. But when
    he asks Sacco (Record, p. 979) if his own cap had a hole in it Sacco replies
    that he is "pretty sure" it didn't. And this ends Sacco's evidence about the
    cap.

    16 Now, it can be said that neither Sacco nor his wife would be anxious
    to help the State prove its case. This is manifestly true. But the point is
    that if the Lowell committee believes it has found evidence that this cap
    was Sacco's, and that it fitted Sacco's head, it cannot have in mind Sacco's
    evidence or his wife's evidence; for if that evidence proves anything it proves
    that the cap was not Sacco's and did not fit his head.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Testimonial Evidence in a Legal Context**\n\nExamine the testimony provided by Sacco and his wife regarding the cap. Based on the text, explain how their statements contradict the prosecution''s claim that the cap was Sacco''s and fitted him.\n- **Step 1**: Identify specific statements from the text that directly challenge the prosecution''s assertion.\n- **Step 2**: Use logical reasoning to connect these statements to the broader implications for the case.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with an evaluation of how this testimony affects the credibility of the prosecution''s evidence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference at least two direct quotes from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how testimonial evidence can be used to refute claims in a legal setting.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Legal and Rhetorical Reasoning**\n\nThe text discusses the conflict between testimonial evidence and the prosecution''s case. Using the principles of classical rhetoric, explain how Sacco''s testimony serves as a counterargument to the prosecution''s evidence.\n- **Step 1**: Outline the structure of a classical argument (thesis, support, conclusion).\n- **Step 2**: Apply this structure to Sacco''s testimony, identifying his thesis and supporting evidence.\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate how this rhetorical approach undermines the prosecution''s case.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate classical rhetoric principles and directly reference the text''s content to demonstrate an understanding of argumentative strategies in legal contexts.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Evidence and Credibility**\n\nThe text suggests that the Lowell committee''s belief in the cap''s connection to Sacco may be based on flawed reasoning. Using the information provided, explain why this belief might be incorrect and how Sacco''s testimony challenges it.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key assumptions the Lowell committee may hold about the cap''s origin.\n- **Step 2**: Use Sacco''s statements to refute these assumptions through logical reasoning.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with an analysis of how testimonial evidence can reveal inconsistencies in the prosecution''s case.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference at least one quote from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how evidence can be used to challenge legal claims.'

- prompt: "17 The committee, therefore, must have some other evidence in mind. There  \nis only one other piece of evidence for it to have in mind. For in the whole  \ncourse of the trial only one other witness was ever questioned about identify-  \ning this cap as Sacco's. This witness was George T. Kelley, superintendent  \nof the factory in which Sacco worked.\n\n18 Kelley takes the stand. He is asked by the prosecuting attorney (Record, p. 449) if he has ever noticed anything in respect to the cap that Sacco wears. He replies, \"Nothing more than coming in to work and hanging it up on a nail.\" He is shown the cap found at the murder scene and asked (Record, p. 450) if this cap is like the one worn by Sacco. He replies:\n\nThe only thing I could say about the cap, Mr. Williams, from hanging up on a nail in the distance, it was similar in color. As far as details are concerned, I could not say it was.\n\n19 He is asked (Record, p. 450) if he ever saw a tear in the lining of Sacco's cap. He answers, \"No, sir.\" He is again asked (Record, p. 452) if the cap found at the murder scene is \"alike in appearance to the cap worn by Sacco,\" and again replies, \"In color only.\" The following colloquy then occurs:\n\nThe Court—That is not responsive to the question. I wish you would answer it, if you can.\n\nThe Witness—I can't answer it when I don't know right down in my  \nheart that that is the cap.\n\nThe Court—I don't want you to. I want you should answer according to  \nwhat is in your heart.\n\nThe Witness—General appearance, that is all I can say. I never saw that  \ncap so close in my life as I do now.\n\n20 Later in the trial Kelley is recalled to the witness-stand by the defense  \nand in the course of cross-examination is asked this question (Record, p. 1046) by the prosecuting attorney: \"Did you realize the importance if your testimony identified that cap as Sacco's cap?\" To which Kelley answers: \"I did not think I had identified it, Mr. Katzmann.\"\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Analyzing the Role of Evidence in a Legal Context\n\nIn the trial described, the prosecution relies on George T. Kelley''s testimony to identify the cap as Sacco''s. However, his identification is later challenged during cross-examination.\n- **Part A**: Identify the specific piece of evidence that the prosecution uses to support their case. Explain why this evidence is considered the "only other piece of evidence" according to the text.\n- **Part B**: Evaluate the credibility of Kelley''s testimony based on his responses to the questions. Specifically, address how his inability to describe specific details (e.g., a tear in the lining) weakens the prosecution''s argument.\n- **Part C**: Consider the courtroom dialogue between the witness and the court. How does this exchange reflect the tension between subjective identification ("in my heart") and objective evidence? Use specific examples from the text to support your reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must analyze the trial''s logical structure and demonstrate an understanding of how evidence is used to build or challenge a legal argument.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Logical Reasoning in Testimony and Cross-Examination\n\nThe defense''s cross-examination of Kelley reveals a key inconsistency in his testimony. The prosecution claims he identified the cap as Sacco''s, but Kelley states he did not think he had identified it.\n- **Part A**: Explain the logical contradiction between the prosecution''s claim and Kelley''s own statement. How does this discrepancy affect the credibility of his testimony?\n- **Part B**: Using the text, construct a logical argument that could be used by the defense to challenge the prosecution''s reliance on Kelley''s testimony. Your argument must reference specific lines from the trial record (e.g., "I did not think I had identified it").\n- **Part C**: Apply the principle of "stare decisis" (following precedent) to this case. How might previous legal cases involving similar testimony influence the outcome of this trial?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate legal reasoning and demonstrate an understanding of how logical inconsistencies in testimony can impact judicial decisions.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Synthesis of Rhetorical and Logical Analysis\n\nThe trial''s structure reflects both rhetorical strategies and logical reasoning. The prosecution attempts to build a case using subjective identification, while the defense uses cross-examination to challenge its validity.\n- **Part A**: Identify two rhetorical strategies used by the prosecution in their questioning of Kelley. How do these strategies align with classical rhetoric principles (e.g., ethos, pathos)?\n- **Part B**: Analyze the logical structure of Kelley''s testimony. Specifically, address how his responses (e.g., "In color only") limit the prosecution''s ability to establish a definitive link between the cap and Sacco.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterargument to the prosecution''s case using the principles of deductive reasoning. Your argument must reference specific parts of the trial record (e.g., "I never saw that cap so close in my life").\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must synthesize rhetorical and logical analysis to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the trial''s arguments and their implications.'

    21 The cap appears once more, in the testimony of one Jeremiah F. Gallivan, Chief of Police of South Braintree, before the Lowell committee. Gallivan testifies that the holes in the lining of the cap found at the murder scene—the holes which the prosecution had attempted to prove were made by the nail where Sacco hung his cap—had been made by the police themselves in an effort to find some identification mark: the lining being intact at the time of the delivery of the cap to Gallivan.

    22 This is the end of the cap. And we are left with the extraordinary conclusion:

    That the Lowell committee has decided that the cap found at the murder scene was Sacco's cap, on the basis of—

    1. Mrs. Sacco's denial of the fact.

    2. Sacco's denial of the fact, and his statement that he could not pull the cap down on his head.

    3. Kelley's testimony that Sacco's cap, which he had only seen "hanging up on a nail in the distance," was like the murder cap "in color only," in "general appearance."

    Kelley denied that he had identified the cap. Then who did identify it?

    23 Who satisfied the Lowell committee so completely regarding the identity of this cap that the Lowell committee is ready to use this cap as one of the six links that justify Sacco's execution?

    24 When there is no other evidence in the record it is no wonder that thoughtful men are puzzled.

    25 From the foregoing it can be seen that the evidence is far from conclusive. And no undue weight should be attached to it on the theory that our criminal system does not make mistakes. It makes many mistakes. In the well-authenticated records of criminal proceedings in this country there are a great number of cases which cast the gravest doubt upon all evidence which rests on snap identification, the testimony of rifle experts and such things. Dozens of cases are known where the evidence seemed conclusive, where juries convicted and where subsequent events proved that the accused was innocent.

    26 The Sacco-Vanzetti case is clouded and obscure. It is full of doubt. The
    fairness of the trial raises doubt. The evidence raises doubt. The inadequate
    review of the evidence raises doubt. The Governor's inquiry has not appeased
    these doubts. The report of his Advisory Committee has not settled these
    doubts. Everywhere there is doubt so deep, so pervasive, so unsettling, that
    it cannot be denied and it cannot be ignored. No man, we submit, should
    be put to death where so much doubt exists.

    27 The real solution of this case would be a new trial before a new judge
    under new conditions. Fervently we hope that the Supreme Judicial Court
    of Massachusetts will decide that under the law such a new trial can be held.
    But if it does not, then to the Governor, to his Council and to his friends
    of justice in Massachusetts we make this plea:

    Stay the execution. Wait. The honor of an American Commonwealth
    is in your hands. Listen, and do not put an irrevocable end upon a
    case that is so full of doubt. It is human to err, and it is possible in
    the sight of God that the whole truth is not yet known.

    THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY: SCIENCE AND CULTURE

    1 I hold very strongly by two convictions:—The first is that neither the
    discipline nor the subject-matter of classical education is of such direct
    value to the student of physical science as to justify the expenditure of valu-
    able time upon either; and the second is that for the purpose of attaining
    real culture, an exclusively scientific education is at least as effectual as
    an exclusively literary education.

    2 I need hardly point out to you that these opinions, especially the latter, are
    diametrically opposed to those of the great majority of educated Englishmen,
    influenced as they are by school and university traditions. In their belief, culture
    is obtainable only by a liberal education; and a liberal education is synony-
    mous, not merely with education and instruction in literature, but in one
    particular form of literature, namely, that of Greek and Roman antiquity.
    They hold that the man who has learned Latin and Greek, however little,
    is educated; while he who is versed in other branches of knowledge, however
    deeply, is a more or less respectable specialist, not admissible into the cul-
    tured caste. The stamp of the educated man, the University degree, is not
    for him.

    3 I am too well acquainted with the generous catholicity of spirit, the true
    sympathy with scientific thought, which pervades the writings of our chief
    apostle of culture, to identify him with these opinions; and yet one may
    cull from one and another of those epistles to the Philistines, which so much
    delight all who do not answer to that name, sentences which lend them
    some support.

    4 Mr. Arnold tells us that the meaning of culture is "to know the best
    that has been thought and said in the world." It is the criticism of life con-
    tained in literature. That criticism regards "Europe as being, for intellectual
    and spiritual purposes, one great confederation, bound to a joint action and
    working to a common result; and whose members have, for their common
    outfit, a knowledge of Greek, Roman, and Eastern antiquity, and of one
    another. Special, local, and temporary advantages being put out of account,
    that modern nation will in the intellectual and spiritual sphere make most

    progress, which most thoroughly carries out this programme. And what is
    that but saying that we too, all of us, as individuals, the more thoroughly we
    carry it out, shall make the more progress?"

    5 We have here to deal with two distinct propositions. The first, that a
    criticism of life is the essence of culture; the second, that literature contains
    the materials which suffice for the construction of such a criticism.

    6 I think that we must all assent to the first proposition. For culture certainly means something quite different from learning or technical skill. It implies the possession of an ideal and the habit of critically estimating the value of things by comparison with a theoretic standard. Perfect culture should supply a complete theory of life, based upon a clear knowledge alike of its possibilities and of its limitations.

    7 But we may agree to all this and yet strongly dissent from the assumption that literature alone is competent to supply this knowledge. After having learned all that Greek, Roman, and Eastern antiquity have thought and said and all that modern literatures have to tell us, it is not self-evident that we have laid a sufficiently broad and deep foundation for that criticism of life which constitutes culture.

    8 Indeed, to any one acquainted with the scope of physical science, it is not at all evident. Considering progress only in the "intellectual and spiritual sphere," I find myself wholly unable to admit that either nations or individuals will really advance, if their common outfit draws nothing from the stores of physical science. I should say that an army, without weapons of precision and with no particular base of operations, might more hopefully enter upon a campaign on the Rhine, than a man, devoid of a knowledge of what physical science has done in the last century, upon a criticism of life.

    9 When a biologist meets with an anomaly, he instinctively turns to the study of development to clear it up. The rationale of contradictory opinions may with equal confidence be sought in history.

    10 It is, happily, no new thing that Englishmen should employ their wealth in building and endowing institutions for educational purposes. But five or six hundred years ago, deeds of foundation expressed or implied conditions as nearly as possible contrary to those which have been thought expedient by Sir Josiah Mason. That is to say, physical science was practically ignored, while a certain literary training was enjoined as a means to the acquirement of knowledge which was essentially theological.

    11 The reason of this singular contradiction between the actions of men alike animated by a strong and disinterested desire to promote the welfare of their fellows is easily discovered.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Cultural Concepts**\n\nGiven the text''s definition of culture as ''the possession of an ideal and the habit of critically estimating the value of things by comparison with a theoretic standard,'' explain how literature alone cannot provide this ''complete theory of life.'' Use examples from the text to support your argument.\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least two distinct areas of knowledge that literature does not encompass.\n- **Step 2**: Reference the text''s discussion on physical science to argue why literature alone is insufficient.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude by explaining how a ''complete theory of life'' requires integration from multiple fields.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly demonstrate an understanding of the text''s argument and integrate at least two examples from the passage.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Historical Context**\n\nThe text contrasts the historical neglect of physical science with modern educational priorities. Explain why the ''singular contradiction'' between past and present actions is significant, using the text''s reasoning.\n- **Step 1**: Define what ''singular contradiction'' means in the context of the text.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze the historical example provided (Sir Josiah Mason''s deeds of foundation) to explain how it creates a contradiction.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this contradiction highlights the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge in modern education.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the specific historical example and link it to the text''s broader argument about culture.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Educational Priorities**\n\nThe text argues that physical science should be integrated into education for a ''complete theory of life.''

    12 At that time, in fact, if any one desired knowledge beyond such as could
    be obtained by his own observation or by common conversation, his first
    necessity was to learn the Latin language, inasmuch as all the higher knowl-
    edge of the western world was contained in works written in that language.
    Hence, Latin grammar, with logic and rhetoric, studied through Latin, were
    the fundamentals of education. With respect to the substance of the knowl-
    edge imparted through this channel, the Jewish and Christian Scriptures,
    as interpreted and supplemented by the Romish Church, were held to con-
    tain a complete and infallibly true body of information.

    13 Theological dicta were, to the thinkers of those days, that which the
    axioms and definitions of Euclid are to the geometers of these. The business
    of the philosophers of the middle ages was to deduce, from the data furnished
    by the theologians, conclusions in accordance with ecclesiastical degrees.
    They were allowed the high privilege of showing, by logical process, how
    and why that which the Church said was true, must be true. And if their
    demonstrations fell short of or exceeded this limit, the Church was mater-
    nally ready to check their aberrations—if need were, by the help of the
    secular arm.

    14 Between the two, our ancestors were furnished with a compact and com-
    plete criticism of life. They were told how the world began and how it would
    end; they learned that all material existence was but a base and insignificant
    blot upon the fair face of the spiritual world and that nature was, to all
    intents and purposes, the playground of the devil; they learned that the
    earth is the centre of the visible universe and that man is the cynosure of
    things terrestrial; and more especially was it inculcated that the course of
    nature had no fixed order, but that it could be, and constantly was, altered
    by the agency of innumerable spiritual beings, good and bad, according as
    they were moved by the deeds and prayers of men. The sum and substance
    of the whole doctrine was to produce the conviction that the only thing
    really worth knowing in this world was how to secure that place in a better,
    which, under certain conditions, the Church promised.

    15 Our ancestors had a living belief in this theory of life and acted upon
    it in their dealings with education, as in all other matters. Culture meant
    saintliness—after the fashion of the saints of those days; the education that
    led to it was, of necessity, theological; and the way to theology lay through
    Latin.

    16 That the study of nature—further than was requisite for the satisfaction
    of everyday wants—should have any bearing on human life was far from
    the thoughts of men thus trained. Indeed, as nature had been cursed for
    man's sake, it was an obvious conclusion that those who meddled with
    nature were likely to come into pretty close contact with Satan. And if any
    born scientific investigator followed his instincts, he might safely reckon
    upon earning the reputation, and probably upon suffering the fate, of a
    sorcerer.

    17 Had the western world been left to itself in Chinese isolation, there is
    no saying how long this state of things might have endured. But happily
    it was not left to itself. Even earlier than the thirteenth century, the develop-
    ment of Moorish civilization in Spain and the great movement of the
    Crusades had introduced the leaven which, from that day to this, has never
    ceased to work. At first, through the intermediation of Arabic translations,
    afterwards by the study of the originals, the western nations of Europe be-
    came acquainted with the writings of the ancient philosophers and poets
    and, in time, with the whole of the vast literature of antiquity.

    18 Whatever there was of high intellectual aspiration or dominant capacity
    in Italy, France, Germany, and England, spent itself for centuries in taking
    possession of the rich inheritance left by the dead civilizations of Greece
    and Rome. Marvelously aided by the invention of printing, classical learning
    spread and flourished. Those who possessed it prided themselves on having
    attained the highest culture then within the reach of mankind.

    1g And justly. For, saving Dante on his solitary pinnacle, there was no
    figure in modern literature, at the time of the Renascence, to compare with
    the men of antiquity; there was no art to compete with their sculpture; there
    was no physical science but that which Greece had created. Above all, there was no other example of perfect intellectual freedom—of the unhesitating
    acceptance of reason as the sole guide to truth and the supreme arbiter of
    conduct.

    20 The new learning necessarily soon exerted a profound influence upon
    education. The language of the monks and schoolmen seemed little better
    than gibberish to scholars fresh from Vergil and Cicero, and the study of
    Latin was placed upon a new foundation. Moreover, Latin itself ceased to
    afford the sole key to knowledge. The student who sought the highest
    thought of antiquity found only a second-hand reflection of it in Roman
    literature and turned his face to the full light of the Greeks. And after a
    battle, not altogether dissimilar to that which is at present being fought over
    the teaching of physical science, the study of Greek was recognized as an
    essential element of all higher education.

    21 Thus the Humanists, as they were called, won the day; and the great
    reform which they effected was of incalculable service to mankind. But the
    Nemesis of all reformers is finality; and the reformers of education, Jike
    those of religion, fell into the profound, however common, error of mistaking
    the beginning for the end of the work of reformation.

    22 The representatives of the Humanists, in the nineteenth century, take
    their stand upon classical education as the sole avenue to culture, as firmly
    as if we were still in the age of Renascence. Yet, surely, the present intelle

    tual relations of the modern and the ancient worlds are profoundly different
    from those which obtained three centuries ago. Leaving aside the existen

    of a great and characteristically modern literature, of modern painting, and,
    especially, of modern music, there is one feature of the present state of the
    civilized world which separates it more widely from the Renascence than
    the Renascence was separated from the middle ages.

    23 This distinctive character of our own times lies in the vast and constantly increasing part which is played by natural knowledge. Not only is our daily life shaped by it, not only does the prosperity of millions of men depend upon it, but our whole theory of life has long been influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the general conceptions of the universe which have been forced upon us by physical science.

    24 In fact, the most elementary acquaintance with the results of scientific investigation shows us that they offer a broad and striking contradiction to the opinion so implicitly credited and taught in the middle ages.

    25 ‘The notions of the beginning and the end of the world entertained by our forefathers are no longer credible. It is very certain that the earth is not the chief body in the universe and that the world is not subordinated to man's use. It is even more certain that nature is the expression of a definite order with which nothing interferes and that the chief business of mankind is to learn that order and govern themselves accordingly. Moreover, this scientific "criticism of life" presents itself to us with different credentials from any other. It appeals not to authority, nor to what anybody may have thought or said, but to nature. It admits that all our interpretations of natural fact are more or less imperfect and symbolic, and bids the learner seek for truth not among words but among things. It warns us that the assertion which outstrips evidence is not only a blunder but a crime.

    26 The purely classical education advocated by the representatives of the Humanists in our day gives no inkling of all this. A man may be a better scholar than Erasmus and know no more of the chief causes of the present intellectual fermentation than Erasmus did. Scholarly and pious persons, worthy of all respect, favour us with allocutions upon the sadness of the antagonism of science to their mediaeval way of thinking, which betray in ignorance of the first principles of scientific investigation, an incapacity for understanding what a man of science means by veracity and an unconsciousness of the weight of established scientific truths, which is almost comical,

    27 There is no great force in the tu guoque argument, or else the advocates of scientific education might fairly enough retort upon the modern Humanists that they may be learned specialists, but that they possess no such sound foundation for a criticism of life as deserves the name of culture. And, indeed, if we were disposed to be cruel, we might urge that the Humanists have brought this reproach upon themselves, not because they are too full of the spirit of the ancient Greek, but because they lack it.

    28 The period of the Renascence is commonly called that of the "Revival of Letters," as if the influences then brought to bear upon the mind of Western Europe had been wholly exhausted in the field of literature. I think it is very commonly forgotten that the revival of science, effected by the same agency, although less conspicuous, was not less momentous.

    29 In fact, the few and scattered students of nature of that day picked up the clue to her secrets exactly as it fell from the hands of the Greeks a thousand years before. The foundations of mathematics were so well laid by them that our children learn their geometry from a book written for the schools of Alexandria two thousand years ago. Modern astronomy is the natural continuation and development of the work of Hipparchus and of Ptolemy; modern physics of that of Democritus and of Archimedes; it was long before modern biological science outgrew the knowledge bequeathed to us by Aristotle, by Theophrastus, and by Galen.

    30 We cannot know all the best thoughts and sayings of the Greeks unless we know what they thought about natural phenomena. We cannot fully apprehend their criticism of life unless we understand the extent to which that criticism was affected by scientific conceptions. We falsely pretend to be the inheritors of their culture, unless we are penetrated, as the best minds among them were, with an unhesitating faith that the free employment of reason, in accordance with scientific method, is the sole method of reaching truth.

    31 Thus I venture to think that the pretensions of our modern Humanists
    to the possession of the monopoly of culture and to the exclusive inheritance
    of the spirit of antiquity must be abated, if not abandoned. But I should be
    very sorry that anything I have said should be taken to imply a desire on
    my part to depreciate the value of a classical education, as it might be and
    as it sometimes is. The native capacities of mankind vary no less than their
    opportunities; and while culture is one, the road by which one man may
    best reach it is widely different from that which is most advantageous to
    another. Again, while scientific education is yet inchoate and tentative,
    classical education is thoroughly well organized upon the practical exper-
    ence of generations of teachers. So that, given ample time for learning and
    destination for ordinary life or for a literary career, I do not think that
    a young Englishman in search of culture can do better than follow the
    course usually marked out for him, supplementing its deficiencies by his
    own efforts.

    32 But for those who mean to make science their serious occupation or who
    intend to follow the profession of medicine or who have to enter early upon
    the business of life—for all these, in my opinion, classical education is
    mistake; and it is for this reason that I am glad to see "mere literary educa-
    tion and instruction" shut out from the curriculum of Sir Josiah Mason's
    College, seeing that its inclusion would probably lead to the introduction of
    the ordinary smattering of Latin and Greek.

    33 Nevertheless, I am the last person to question the importance of genuine
    literary education or to suppose that intellectual culture can be complete
    without it. An exclusively scientific training will bring about a mental twist
    as surely as an exclusively literary training. The value of the cargo does not
    compensate for a ship's being out of trim; and I should be very sorry to
    think that the Scientific College would turn out none but lopsided men.

    34 There is no need, however, that such a catastrophe should happen.
    Instruction in English, French, and German is provided, and thus the three
    greatest literatures of the modern world are made accessible to the student.
    French and German, and especially the latter language, are absolutely indispensable to those who desire full knowledge in any department of science.
    But even supposing that the knowledge of these languages acquired is not
    more than sufficient for purely scientific purposes, every Englishman has,
    in his native tongue, an almost perfect instrument of literary expression:
    and, in his own literature, models of every kind of literary excellence. If an
    Englishman cannot get literary culture out of his Bible, his Shakespeare, his
    Milton, neither, in my belief, will the profoundest study of Homer and
    Sophocles, Vergil and Horace, give it to him.

    35 Thus, since the constitution of the College makes sufficient provision
    for literary as well as for scientific education and since artistic instruction
    is also contemplated, it seems to me that a fairly complete culture is offered
    to all who are willing to take advantage of it.

    36 But I am not sure that at this point the "practical" man, scotched but
    not slain, may ask what all this talk about culture has to do with an Institu-
    tion, the object of which is defined to be "to promote the prosperity of the

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Cultural and Scientific Education**\n\nGiven the text''s discussion on the importance of literary education alongside scientific study, compose a paragraph that argues whether the College''s mission to promote ''the prosperity of the manufactures and the industry of the country'' is compatible with its commitment to cultural and literary education.\n- **Step 1**: Reference the text''s assertion that ''literary culture'' is essential for an Englishman.\n- **Step 2**: Use the quote ''the profoundest study of Homer and Sophocles... give it to him'' to support your argument.\n- **Step 3**: Integrate the idea that ''a fairly complete culture'' is offered to those who seek it.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must be a coherent argument that directly addresses the compatibility of cultural and scientific education with industrial prosperity, using specific quotes from the text as cited.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Reasoning**\n\nThe text describes the College as providing instruction in English, French, and German to ''make accessible to the student'' the three greatest literatures of the modern world. Using rhetorical strategies from classical rhetoric, construct a persuasive argument that addresses the following:\n- **Part A**: Define what ''literary culture'' means in the context of the text.\n- **Part B**: Use the quote ''every Englishman has, in his native tongue... models of every kind of literary excellence'' to argue that ''literary culture'' is not only accessible but also essential.\n- **Part C**: Incorporate the idea that ''artistic instruction is also contemplated'' to argue for the practical value of aesthetic education in industrial society.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be structured using classical rhetorical strategies (e.g., ethos, pathos, logos) and explicitly reference the text''s definitions of ''literary culture'' and ''artistic instruction''.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Educational Priorities**\n\nThe text presents a defense of the College''s mission, but also acknowledges the potential criticism that ''what is wanted for this end [prosperity of industry] is not culture, but simply a knowledge of applied science.'' Construct a counterargument to this criticism using logical reasoning based on the text.\n- **Part A**: Identify two key points from the text that challenge the notion that ''applied science'' is sufficient for industrial prosperity.\n- **Part B**: Use the quote ''a fairly complete culture is offered to all who are willing to take advantage of it'' to argue that cultural education provides a broader foundation for innovation.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the text''s emphasis on ''literary expression'' and ''models of literary excellence'' contributes to the development of a skilled workforce capable of driving industrial progress.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your counterargument must be logically structured, citing specific text references to support each point and demonstrating an understanding of the interplay between culture and applied science in industrial development.'

    37 I often wish that this phrase, "applied science," had never been invented.
    For it suggests that there is a sort of scientific knowledge of direct practical
    use, which can be studied apart from another sort of scientific knowledge,
    which is of no practical utility and which is termed "pure science." But
    there is no more complete fallacy than this. What people call applied science
    is nothing but the application of pure science to particular classes of problems.
    It consists of deductions from those general principles, established by reason-
    ing and observation, which constitute pure science. No one can safely make
    these deductions until he has a firm grasp of the principles; and he can
    obtain that grasp only by personal experience of the operations of observa-
    tion and of reasoning on which they are founded.

    248 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    38 Almost all the processes employed in the arts and manufactures fall
    within the range either of physics or of chemistry. In order to improve them,
    one must thoroughly understand them; and no one has a chance of really
    understanding them unless he has obtained that mastery of principles and
    that habit of dealing with facts, which is given by long-continued and well-
    directed purely scientific training in the physical and the chemical laboratory.
    So that there really is no question as to the necessity of purely scientific
    discipline, even if the work of the College were limited by the narrowest
    interpretation of its stated aims.

    39 And as to the desirableness of a wider culture than that yielded by
    science alone, it is to be recollected that the improvement of manufacturing
    processes is only one of the conditions which contribute to the prosperity
    of industry. Industry is a means and not an end; and mankind work only
    to get something which they want. What that something is depends partly
    on their innate, and partly on their acquired, desires.

    40 If the wealth resulting from prosperous industry is to be spent upon the
    gratification of unworthy desires, if the increasing perfection of manufac-
    turing processes is to be accompanied by an increasing debasement of those
    who carry them on, I do not see the good of industry and prosperity.

    2 Some of you may possibly remember a phrase of mine which has been
    the object of a good deal of comment; an observation to the effect that in
    our culture, the aim being to know ourselves and the world, we have, as the
    means to this end, to know the best which has been thought and said in the
    world. A man of science, who is also an excellent writer and the very prince
    of debaters, Professor Huxley, in a discourse at the opening of Sir Josiah
    Mason's college at Birmingham, laying hold of this phrase, expanded it by
    quoting some more words of mine, which are these: "The civilized world
    is to be regarded as now being, for intellectual and spiritual purposes, one
    great confederation, bound to a joint action and working to a common result;
    and whose members have for their proper outfit a knowledge of Greek,
    Roman, and Eastern antiquity, and of one another. Special local and tem-
    porary advantages being put out of account, that modern nation will in the
    intellectual and spiritual sphere make most progress which most thoroughly
    carries out this programme."

    3 Now on my phrase, thus enlarged, Professor Huxley remarks that when
    I speak of the above-mentioned knowledge as enabling us to know ourselves
    and the world, I assert Literature to contain the materials which suffice for
    thus making us know ourselves and the world. But it is not by any means
    clear, says he, that after having learnt all which ancient and modern litera-
    tures have to tell us, we have laid a sufficiently broad and deep foundation
    for the criticism of life, that knowledge of ourselves and the world, which
    constitutes culture. On the contrary, Professor Huxley declares that he finds
    himself "wholly unable to admit that either nations or individuals will
    really advance, if their outfit draws nothing from the stores of physical
    science. An army without weapons of precision, and with no particular base
    of operations, might more hopefully enter upon a campaign on the Rhine,
    than a man, devoid of a knowledge of what physical science has done in the
    last century, upon a criticism of life."

    4 This shows how needful it is for those who are to discuss any matters together, to have a common understanding as to the sense of the terms they employ—how needful and how difficult. What Professor Huxley says, implies just the reproach which is so often brought against the study of belles lettres, as they are called: that the study is an elegant one, but slight and ineffectual; a smattering of Greek and Latin and other ornamental things, of little use for any one whose object is to get at truth and to be a practical man. So, too, M. Renan talks of the "superficial humanism" of a school-course which treats us as if we were all going to be poets, writers, preachers, orators, and he opposes this humanism to positive science or the critical search after truth. And there is always a tendency in those who are remonstrating against the predominance of letters in education to understand by letters belles lettres and by belles lettres a superficial humanism, the opposite of science or true knowledge.

    5 But when we talk of knowing Greek and Roman antiquity, for instance, which is the knowledge people have called the humanities, I for my part mean a knowledge which is something more than a superficial humanism, mainly decorative. "I call all teaching scientific," says Wolf, the critic of Homer, "which is systematically laid out and followed up to its original sources. For example: a knowledge of classical antiquity is scientific when the remains of classical antiquity are correctly studied in the original languages." There can be no doubt that Wolf is perfectly right; that all learning is scientific which is systematically laid out and followed up to its original sources and that a genuine humanism is scientific.

    6 When I speak of knowing Greek and Roman antiquity, therefore, as a
    help to knowing ourselves and the world, I mean more than a knowledge
    of so much vocabulary, so much grammar, so many portions of authors in
    the Greek and Latin languages—I mean knowing the Greeks and Romans,
    and their life and genius, and what they were and did in the world; what
    we get from them and what is its value. That, at least, is the ideal; and when
    we talk of endeavouring to know Greek and Roman antiquity, as a help
    to knowing ourselves and the world, we mean endeavouring so to know
    them as to satisfy this ideal, however much we may still fall short of it.

    7 The same also as to knowing our own and other modern nations, with
    the like aim of getting to understand ourselves and the world. To know the
    best that has been thought and said by the modern nations is to know, says
    Professor Huxley, "only what modern literature have to tell us; it is the
    criticism of life contained in modern literature." And yet "the distinctive
    character of our times," he urges, "lies in the vast and constantly increasing
    part which is played by natural knowledge." And how, therefore, can a man,
    devoid of knowledge of what physical science has done in the last century,
    enter hopefully upon a criticism of modern life?

    8 Let us, I say, be agreed about the meaning of the terms we are using. |
    talk of knowing the best which has been thought and uttered in the world;
    Professor Huxley says this means knowing literature. Literature is a large
    word; it may mean everything written with letters or printed in a book.

    That reaches us through books is literature. But by literature Professor Huxley means belles lettres. He means to make me say, that knowing the best which has been thought and said by the modern nations is knowing their belles lettres and no more. And this is no sufficient equipment, he argues, for a criticism of modern life. But as I do not mean, by knowing ancient Rome, knowing merely more or less of Latin belles lettres and taking no account of Rome's military and political and legal and administrative work in the world; and as, by knowing ancient Greece, I understand knowing her as the giver of Greek art and the guide to a free and right use of reason and to scientific method, and the founder of our mathematics and physics and astronomy and biology—I understand knowing her as all this and not merely knowing certain Greek poems and histories and treatises and speeches—so as to the knowledge of modern nations also. By knowing modern nations, I mean not merely knowing their belles lettres, but knowing also what has been done by such men as Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Darwin. "Our ancestors learned," says Professor Huxley, "that the earth is the centre of the visible universe and that man is the cynosure of things terrestrial; and more especially was it inculcated that the course of nature had no fixed order, but that it could be, and constantly was, altered." But for us now, continues Professor Huxley, "the notions of the beginning and the end of the world entertained by our forefathers are no longer credible. It is very certain that the earth is not the chief body in the material universe and that the world is not subordinated to man's use. It is even more certain that nature is the expression of a definite order, with which nothing interferes." "And yet," he cries, "the purely classical education advocated by the representatives of the humanists in our day gives no inkling of all this!"

    9 In due place and time I will just touch upon that vexed question of classical education; but at present the question is as to what is meant by knowing the best which modern nations have thought and said. It is not knowing their belles lettres merely which is meant. To know Italian belles lettres is not to know Italy, and to know English belles lettres is not to know England. Into knowing Italy and England there comes a great deal more, Galileo and Newton amongst it. The reproach of being a superficial humanism, a tincture of belles lettres, may attach rightly enough to some other disciplines; but to the particular discipline recommended when I proposed knowing the best that has been thought and said in the world, it does not apply. In that best I certainly include what in modern times has been thought and said by the great observers and knowers of nature.

    10 There is, therefore, really no question between Professor Huxley and me as to whether knowing the great results of the modern scientific study of nature is not required as a part of our culture, as well as knowing the products of literature and art. But to follow the processes by which those results are reached, ought, say the friends of physical science, to be made the staple of education for the bulk of mankind. And here there does arise a question between those whom Professor Huxley calls with playful sarcasm "the Levites of culture," and those whom the poor humanist is sometimes apt to regard as its Nebuchadnezzars.

    11 The great results of the scientific investigation of nature we are agreed upon knowing, but how much of our study are we bound to give to the processes by which those results are reached? The results have their visible bearing on human life. But all the processes, too, all the items of fact, by which those results are reached and established, are interesting. All knowledge is interesting to a wise man, and the knowledge of nature is interesting to all men. It is very interesting to know that from the albuminous white of the egg the chick in the egg gets the materials for its flesh, bones, blood, and feathers, while from the fatty yolk of the egg it gets the heat and energy which enable it at length to break its shell and begin the world. It is less interesting, perhaps, but still it is interesting, to know that when a taper burns, the wax is converted into carbonic acid and water. Moreover, it is quite true that the habit of dealing with facts, which is given by the study of nature, is, as the friends of physical science praise it for being, an excellent discipline. The appeal, in the study of nature, is constantly to observation and experiment; not only is it said that the thing is so, but we can be made to see that it is so. Not only does a man tell us that when a taper burns the wax is converted into carbonic acid and water, as a man may tell us, if he likes, that Charon is punting his ferry-boat on the river Styx, or that Victor Hugo is a sublime poet, or Mr. Gladstone the most admirable of statesmen; but we are made to see that the conversion into carbonic acid and water does actually happen. This reality of natural knowledge it is which makes the friends of physical science contrast it, as a knowledge of things, with the humanist's knowledge, which is, say they, a knowledge of words. And hence Professor Huxley is moved to lay it down that "for the purpose of attaining real culture, an exclusively scientific education is at least as effectual as an exclusively literary education."

    It declares that if a man, in his mental training, "has substituted literature and history for natural science, he has chosen the less useful alternative." But whether we go these lengths or not, we must admit that in natural science the habit gained of dealing with facts is a most valuable discipline and that everyone should have some experience of it.

    12 More than this, however, is demanded by the reformers. It is proposed to make the training in natural science the main part of education, for the great majority of mankind at any rate. And here, I confess, I part company with the friends of physical science, with whom up to this point I have been agreeing. In differing from them, however, I wish to proceed with the utmost caution and diffidence. The smallness of my own acquaintance with the disciplines of natural science is ever before my mind, and I am fearful of doing these disciplines an injustice. The ability and pugnacity of the partisans of natural science make them formidable persons to contradict. The tone of tentative inquiry, which befits a being of dim faculties and bounded knowledge, is the tone I would wish to take and not to depart from. At present it seems to me that those who are for giving to natural knowledge, as they call it, the chief place in the education of the majority of mankind, leave one important thing out of their account: the constitution of human nature. But I put this forward on the strength of some facts not at all recondite, very far from it; facts capable of being stated in the simplest possible fashion, and to which, if I so state them, the man of science will, I am sure, be willing to allow their due weight.

    13 Deny the facts altogether, I think, he hardly can. He can hardly deny
    that when we set ourselves to enumerate the powers which go to the building
    up of human life, and say that they are the power of conduct, the power of
    intellect and knowledge, the power of beauty, and the power of social life
    and manners—he can hardly deny that this scheme, though drawn in rough
    and plain lines enough, and not pretending to scientific exactness, does yet
    give a fairly true representation of the matter. Human nature is built up by
    these powers; we have the need for them all. When we have rightly met and
    adjusted the claims of them all, we shall then be in a fair way for getting
    soberness and righteousness with wisdom. This is evident enough, and the
    friends of physical science would admit it.

    14 But perhaps they may not have sufficiently observed another thing:
    namely, that the several powers just mentioned are not isolated, but there is,
    in the generality of mankind, a perpetual tendency to relate them one to an-
    other in divers ways. With one such way of relating them I am particularly
    concerned now. Following our instinct for intellect and knowledge, we ac-
    quire pieces of knowledge; and presently, in the generality of men, there
    arises the desire to relate these pieces of knowledge to our sense for conduct,
    to our sense for beauty—and there is weariness and dissatisfaction if the desire
    is balked. Now in this desire lies, I think, the strength of that hold which
    letters have upon us.

    15 All knowledge is, as I said just now, interesting; and even items of
    knowledge which from the nature of the case cannot well be related, but
    must stand isolated in our thoughts, have their interest. Even lists of excep-
    tions have their interest. If we are studying Greek accents, it is interesting
    to know that pais and pas, and some other monosyllables of the same form
    of declension, do not take the circumflex upon the last syllable of the genitive
    plural, but vary, in this respect, from the common rule. If we are studying

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Knowledge and Conduct**\n\nThe text mentions that ''the several powers... are not isolated, but there is a perpetual tendency to relate them one to another.''\n- **Part A**: Explain why this interrelation is essential for a ''fairly true representation of the matter.''\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the desire to relate knowledge to ''sense for conduct, sense for beauty'' creates a ''hold which letters have upon us.''\n- **Part C**: Provide an example from the text that illustrates this interrelation (e.g., Greek accents and exceptions).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate logical reasoning based on the text''s argument about knowledge and human nature.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Knowledge Classification**\n\nThe text states that ''all knowledge is interesting,'' even isolated items of knowledge.\n- **Part A**: Explain why ''lists of exceptions'' are considered interesting according to the text.\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument that ''knowledge of exceptions'' is a form of intellectual pursuit, even if it doesn''t relate to other powers.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of this view for education and the role of ''letters'' in transmitting knowledge.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reflect the text''s perspective on the value of all knowledge, even when it seems isolated or exceptional.'

    In physiology, it is interesting to know that the pulmonary artery carries dark blood and the pulmonary vein carries bright blood, departing in this respect from the common rule for the division of labour between the veins and the arteries. But every one knows how we seek naturally to combine the pieces of our knowledge together, to bring them under general rules, to relate them to principles; and how unsatisfactory and tiresome it would be to go on forever learning lists of exceptions or accumulating items of fact which must stand isolated.

    16 Well, that same need of relating our knowledge, which operates here within the sphere of our knowledge itself, we shall find operating also outside that sphere. We experience, as we go on learning and knowing—the vast majority of us experience—the need of relating what we have learnt and known to the sense which we have in us for conduct, to the sense which we have in us for beauty.

    17 A certain Greek prophetess of Mantineia in Arcadia, Diotima by name, once explained to the philosopher Socrates that love and impulse and bent of all kinds is, in fact, nothing else but the desire in men that good should forever be present to them. This desire for good, Diotima assured Socrates, is our fundamental desire, of which every impulse in us is only one particular form. And therefore this fundamental desire it is, I suppose—this desire in men that good should be forever present to them—which acts in us when we feel the impulse for relating our knowledge to our sense for conduct and to our sense for beauty. At any rate, with men in general the instinct exists. Such is human nature. And the instinct, it will be admitted, is innocent, and human nature is preserved by our following the lead of its innocent instincts. Therefore, in seeking to gratify this instinct in question, we are following the instinct of self-preservation in humanity.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Human Instinct and Knowledge Pursuit**\n\nBased on the passage, explain how the instinct to relate knowledge to conduct and beauty is a form of self-preservation.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the core argument presented by Diotima about human nature and instinct.\n- **Step 2**: Connect this to the idea that seeking knowledge for its relation to conduct and beauty is a natural human drive.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why satisfying this instinct aligns with self-preservation, using the text''s claim that ''human nature is preserved by following the lead of its innocent instincts.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference Diotima''s explanation and the text''s assertion about self-preservation, demonstrating logical reasoning about human nature and knowledge pursuit.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Love as a Fundamental Desire**\n\nUsing the text, explain how Diotima''s definition of love as ''the desire in men that good should forever be present to them'' relates to the human instinct for knowledge.\n- **Part A**: Describe Diotima''s view on love and its connection to the pursuit of good.\n- **Part B**: Link this to the text''s argument about human instinct and the need to relate knowledge to conduct and beauty.\n- **Part C**: Explain why this fundamental desire for good is considered ''innocent'' according to the text, and how it influences human behavior.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate Diotima''s philosophy with the text''s discussion on human nature and instincts, showing a clear connection between love, knowledge, and self-preservation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Instinct to Knowledge Acquisition**\n\nThe text suggests that the instinct to relate knowledge to conduct and beauty is an ''innocent'' part of human nature. Construct a logical argument that demonstrates how this instinct leads to the pursuit of knowledge.\n- **Part A**: Use Diotima''s explanation of love as a desire for good to justify the pursuit of knowledge.\n- **Part B**: Explain how this instinct is ''innocent'' and why it''s important for human preservation.\n- **Part C**: Provide an example from the text that illustrates how this instinct operates in real human behavior.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate reasoning based on the text''s discussion of human nature, instincts, and the pursuit of good through knowledge.'

    18 But, no doubt, some kinds of knowledge cannot be made to directly serve the instinct in question, cannot be directly related to the sense of beauty, to the sense for conduct. These are instrument-knowledges; they lead on to other knowledges which can. A man who passes his life in instrument-knowledges is a specialist. They may be invaluable as instruments to do something beyond, for those who have the gift thus to employ them; and they may be disciplines in themselves wherein it is useful for everyone to have some schooling. But it is inconceivable that the generality of men should pass all their mental life with Greek accents or with formal logic. My friend Professor Sylvester, who is one of the first mathematicians in the world, holds transcendental doctrines as to the virtue of mathematics, but those doctrines are not for common men. In the very Senate House and heart of our English Cambridge I once ventured, though not without an apology for my profaneness, to hazard the opinion that for the majority of mankind "little of mathematics, even, goes a long way. Of course this is quite consistent

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on the Limitations of Knowledge**\n\nThe text argues that "for the majority of mankind, little of mathematics even goes a long way." Using this statement, construct an argument about the limitations of specialized knowledge in shaping the general populace.\n- **Step 1**: Interpret the text''s claim about mathematics and its relevance to common people.\n- **Step 2**: Propose a counterargument that challenges the idea that specialized knowledge is inherently inaccessible.\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate which perspective (text''s or counterargument) is more plausible based on the text''s reasoning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must reflect the text''s central theme and demonstrate critical thinking about the role of specialized knowledge in society.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving: The Role of Rhetoric in Knowledge**\n\nThe text mentions the "virtue of mathematics" but also acknowledges that it is not for common men. Using the concept of classical rhetoric, construct a rhetorical argument for why mathematics should be accessible to all.\n- **Step 1**: Define classical rhetoric as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Use rhetorical strategies (e.g., ethos, pathos, logos) to argue for the accessibility of mathematics.\n- **Step 3**: Address potential counterarguments by referencing the text''s discussion of "instrument-knowledge" and its role in society.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must integrate the text''s themes and demonstrate a clear understanding of classical rhetoric as applied to education and knowledge accessibility.'

    but it is the few who have the aptitude for using them, not the bulk of mankind.
    19 The natural sciences do not, however, stand on the same footing with
    these instrument-knowledges. Experience shows us that the generality of

    converted into carbonic acid and water, or in learning the explanation of the
    phenomenon of dew, or in learning how the circulation of the blood is carried on,

    20 Interesting indeed, these results of science are, important they are, and
    we should all of us be acquainted with them. But what I now wish you to
    mark is that we are still, when they are propounded to us and we receive
    them, we are still in the sphere of intellect and knowledge. And for the gen-
    erality of men there will be found, I say, to arise, when they have duly taken
    in the proposition that their ancestor was "a hairy quadruped furnished with
    a tail and pointed ears, probably arboreal in his habits," there will be found
    to arise an invincible desire to relate this proposition to the sense in us for
    conduct and to the sense in us for beauty. But this the men of science will
    not do for us and will hardly even profess to do. They will give us other
    pieces of knowledge, other facts, about other animals and their ancestors, or
    about plants, or about stones, or about stars; and they may finally bring us
    to those great "general conceptions of the universe, which are forced upon
    us all," says Professor Huxley, "by the progress of physical science." But still
    it will be knowledge only which they give us; knowledge not put for us into
    relation with our sense for conduct, our sense for beauty, and touched with
    emotion by being so put; not thus put for us, and therefore, to the majority
    of mankind, after a certain while, unsatisfying, wearying.

    experience the necessity for two things which most men find so necessary to
    them—religion and poetry; science and the domestic affections, he thought,
    were enough. To a born naturalist, I can well understand that this should
    seem so. So absorbing is his occupation with nature, so strong his love for
    his occupation, that he goes on acquiring natural knowledge and reasoning
    upon it, and has little time or inclination for thinking about getting it related
    to the desire in man for conduct, the desire in man for beauty. He relates it
    to them for himself as he goes along, so far as he feels the need; and he
    draws from the domestic affections all the additional solace necessary. But
    then Darwins are extremely rare. Another great and admirable master of
    natural knowledge, Faraday, was a Sandemanian. That is to say, he related
    his knowledge to his instinct for conduct and to his instinct for beauty by
    the aid of that respectable Scottish sectary, Robert Sandeman. And so strong,
    in general, is the demand of religion and poetry to have their share in a man,
    to associate themselves with his knowing, and to relieve and rejoice it, that,
    probably, for one man amongst us with the disposition to do as Darwin did
    in this respect, there are at least fifty with the disposition to do as Faraday.
    22 Education lays hold upon us, in fact, by satisfying this demand. Professor
    Huxley holds up to scorn mediaeval education with its neglect of the know}-
    ledge of nature, its poverty even of literary studies, its formal logic devoted
    to "showing how and why that which the Church said was true must be
    true." But the great mediaeval Universities were not brought into being, we
    may be sure, by the zeal for giving a jejune and contemptible education.
    Kings have been their nursing fathers, and queens have been their nursing
    mothers, but not for this. The mediaeval Universities came into being because
    the supposed knowledge, delivered by Scripture and the Church, so deeply
    engaged men's hearts, by so simply, easily, and powerfully relating itself to
    their desire for conduct, their desire for beauty. All other knowledge was
    dominated by this supposed knowledge and was subordinated to it, because

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Rhetorical Argumentation**\n\nThe text suggests that humane letters are essential to "establish a relation between the new conceptions and our instinct for beauty." Create an original argument that applies this principle to a modern issue, such as climate change or artificial intelligence.\n- **Part A**: Choose one contemporary issue and explain how it relates to the concept of "new conceptions of the universe."\n- **Part B**: Using the text''s logic, show how humane letters (or classical rhetoric) can be used to "establish a relation between the new conceptions and our instinct for beauty."\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on "the paramount desire in men that good should be forever present to them" influences the argument you''ve constructed.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s rhetorical concepts with a modern issue, showing creative application of the ideas presented.

    24 Have humane letters, then, have poetry and eloquence, the power here
    attributed to them of engaging the emotions, and do they exercise it? And if
    they have it and exercise it, how do they exercise it, so as to exert an influence
    upon man's sense for conduct, his sense for beauty? Finally, even if
    they both can and do exert an influence upon the senses in question, how are
    they to relate to them the results—the modern results—of natural science?
    All these questions may be asked. First, have poetry and eloquence the power
    of calling out the emotions? The appeal is to experience. Experience shows
    that for the vast majority of men, for mankind in general, they have the
    power. Next, do they exercise it? They do. But then, how do they exercise
    it so as to affect man's sense for conduct, his sense for beauty? And this is
    perhaps a case for applying the Preacher's words: "Though a man labour to
    seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea, farther, though a wise man think to
    know it, yet shall he not be able to find it." Why should it be one thing, in
    its effect upon the emotions, to say, "Patience is a virtue," and quite another
    thing, in its effect upon the emotions, to say with Homer, ταύτων ἡ μοῖρα δὲ πρὸς ὅπως ἀγαθὰ ἥ δὲ γῆ πρὸς τοὺς υἱούς ἀνθρώπων—"for an enduring heart have the destinies
    appointed to the children of men"? Why should it be one thing, in its effect
    upon the emotions, to say with the philosopher Spinoza, Felicitas in ea consistit quod homo suum esse conservare potest—‘Man's happiness consists in
    his being able to preserve his own essence," and quite another thing, in its
    effect upon the emotions, to say with the Gospel, "What is a man advantaged,
    if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, forfeit himself?" How does this
    difference of effect arise? I cannot tell, and I am not much concerned to
    know; the important thing is that it does arise and that we can profit by it.
    But how, finally, are poetry and eloquence to exercise the power of relating

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Influence**\n\nGiven the text''s discussion on how poetry and eloquence engage emotions, compare and contrast two distinct rhetorical strategies mentioned: (1) the use of moral maxims like ''Patience is a virtue'' and (2) the use of mythic or dramatic imagery as in Homer''s quote.\n- **Task**: Explain how each strategy influences the audience''s sense of conduct and beauty, referencing Corbett''s argument about their differing effects.\n- **Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s central thesis regarding the power of rhetoric to shape emotional and ethical responses, with a clear distinction between the two approaches.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analytical Reasoning on Rhetorical Power**\n\nThe text questions whether poetry and eloquence can effectively communicate modern scientific results. Using Corbett''s argument, formulate a logical response to this challenge:\n- **Part A**: Argue that poetry and eloquence can indeed relate modern results to the senses of conduct and beauty.\n- **Part B**: Construct a counterargument that such communication is inherently limited, and then refute it using the text''s examples of Homer and Spinoza.\n- **Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion on the necessity of rhetorical power in conveying complex ideas, with clear references to the examples provided.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nDesign a rhetorical passage that uses both moral maxims and mythic imagery to address the modern issue of climate change.\n- **Task**: Ensure that your passage includes at least three elements from the text: (1) a moral maxim, (2) a mythic reference, and (3) an appeal to the senses of conduct and beauty.\n- **Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an ability to synthesize the text''s ideas on rhetorical strategy, with a clear integration of the examples and arguments discussed in Corbett''s work.'

    The modern results of natural science to man's instinct for conduct, his in-

    exercise it, but that they can and will exercise it I am sure. But I do not mean
    that modern philosophical poets and modern philosophical moralists are to
    come and relate for us, in express terms, the results of modern scientific re-
    search to our instinct for conduct, our instinct for beauty. But I mean that
    we shall find, as a matter of experience, if we know the best that has been
    thought and uttered in the world—we shall find that the art and poetry and

    also the power—such is the strength and worth, in essentials, of their authors'
    criticism of life—they have a fortifying, and elevating, and quickening, and
    suggestive power, capable of wonderfully helping us to relate the results of
    modern science to our need for conduct, our need for beauty. Homer's con-
    ceptions of the physical universe were, I imagine, grotesque; but really, under
    the shock of hearing from modern science that "the world is not subordi-

    25 And the more that men's minds are cleared, the more that the results
    of science are frankly accepted, the more that poetry and eloquence come to
    be received and studied as what in truth they really are—the criticism of life
    by gifted men, alive and active with extraordinary power at an unusual num-
    ber of points—so much the more will the value of humane letters, and of art
    also, which is an utterance having a like kind of power with theirs, be felt
    and acknowledged, and their place in education be secured.

    26 Let us, therefore, all of us, avoid indeed as much as possible any invidious
    comparison between the merits of humane letters, as means of education,
    and the merits of the natural sciences. But when some President of a Section
    for Mechanical Science insists on making the comparison and tells us that
    "he who in his training has substituted literature and history for natural sci-
    ence has chosen the less useful alternative," let us make answer to him that
    the student of humane letters only, will, at least, know also the great con-
    ceptions brought in by modern physical science, for science, as Professor
    Huxley says, forces them upon us all. But the student of the natural sciences
    only, will, by our very hypothesis, know nothing of humane letters; not to
    mention that in setting himself to be perpetually accumulating natural knowl-
    edge, he sets himself to do what only specialists have in general the gift for
    doing genially. And so he will probably be unsatisfied, or at any rate incom-
    plete, and even more incomplete than the student of humane letters only.

    27 I once mentioned in a school-report how a young man in one of our
    English training colleges having to paraphrase the passage in Macbeth be-
    ginning,

    Can'st thou not minister to a mind diseased?

    turned this line into, "Can you not wait upon the lunatic?" And I remarked
    what a curious state of things it would be if every pupil of our national
    schools knew, let us say, that the moon is two thousand one hundred and
    sixty miles in diameter, and thought at the same time that a good paraphrase

    I would rather have a young person ignorant about the moon's diameter, but
    aware that "Can you not wait upon the lunatic?" is bad, than a young per-
    son whose education had been such as to manage things the other way.

    28 Or to go higher than the pupils of our national schools. I have in my
    mind's eye a member of our British Parliament who comes to travel here in
    America, who afterwards relates his travels and who shows a really masterly
    knowledge of the geology of this great country and of its mining capabilities,
    but who ends by gravely suggesting that the United States should borrow a
    prince from our Royal Family, and should make him their king, and should
    create a House of Lords of great landed proprietors after the pattern of ours;
    and then America, he thinks, would have her future happily and perfectly
    secured. Surely, in this case, the President of the Section for Mechanical Sci-
    ence would himself hardly say that our member of Parliament, by concen-
    trating himself upon geology and mineralogy and so on, and not attending
    to literature and history, had "chosen the more useful alternative."

    29 If then there is to be separation and option between humane letters on
    the one hand and the natural sciences on the other, the great majority of
    mankind, all who have not exceptional over-powering aptitudes for the
    study of nature, would do well, I cannot but think, to choose to be educated
    in humane letters rather than in the natural sciences. Letters will call out
    their being at more points, will make them live more.

    J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER: ON SCIENCE AND CULTURE

    1 We live in an unusual world, marked by very great and irreversible
    changes that occur within the span of a man's life. We live in a time where
    our knowledge and understanding of the world of nature grows wider and
    deeper at an unparalleled rate; and where the problems of applying this
    knowledge to man's needs and hopes are new, and only a little illuminated
    by our past history.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Knowledge and Cultural Responsibility**\n\nMr. Oppenheimer argues that a scientist''s responsibility extends beyond the technical aspects of their work to include cultural and moral considerations. Using examples from the text, explain how a scientist''s understanding of culture should influence their decision-making process.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key points from Oppenheimer''s text that discuss the role of culture in science.\n- **Step 2**: Apply these points to a hypothetical scenario involving scientific innovation and cultural impact.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your conclusion by referencing Oppenheimer''s argument about the balance between scientific progress and cultural responsibility.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of Oppenheimer''s perspective and apply it to a logical, well-reasoned scenario.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Educational Priorities**\n\nOppenheimer contrasts the education of ''pupils of our national schools'' with that of a British Parliament member who demonstrates expertise in geology and mining but lacks knowledge in literature and history. Using the text, evaluate the argument that education should prioritize scientific disciplines over humanities.\n- **Step 1**: Outline Oppenheimer''s critique of the Parliament member''s approach to education.\n- **Step 2**: Compare this critique to his statement about the majority of mankind choosing humane letters over natural sciences.\n- **Step 3**: Construct a logical argument that supports or challenges Oppenheimer''s conclusion about educational priorities.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate Oppenheimer''s reasoning and demonstrate a clear, logical evaluation of educational values.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Ethical Dilemma in Scientific Innovation**\n\nOppenheimer raises the question of whether a scientist should prioritize technical expertise over cultural understanding. Imagine you are a scientist working on a technology that could have profound societal impacts. Using the text, construct an ethical framework for decision-making that balances scientific progress with cultural considerations.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key ethical principles from Oppenheimer''s text that guide scientific responsibility.\n- **Step 2**: Apply these principles to a hypothetical technological innovation with potential cultural implications.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your framework by referencing Oppenheimer''s argument about the role of culture in science.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must show a deep understanding of Oppenheimer''s argument and apply it to a logically sound ethical scenario.'

    4 Today, culture and tradition have assumed a very different intellectual
    and social purpose. The principal function of the most vital and living tradi-
    tions today is precisely to provide the instruments of rapid change. There
    are many things which go together to bring about this alteration in man's
    life; but probably the decisive one is science itself. I will use that word as
    broadly as I know, meaning the natural sciences, meaning the historical sci-
    ences, meaning all those matters on which men can converse objectively with
    each other. I shall not continually repeat the distinction between science as
    an effort to find out about the world and understand it, on the one hand,
    and science, in its applications in technology, as an effort to do something
    useful with the knowledge so acquired. But certain care is called for, because,
    if we call this the scientific age, we make more than one kind of oversimplifi-
    cation. When we talk about science today, we are likely to think of the biol-
    ogist with his microscope or the physicist with his cyclotron; but almost
    certainly a great deal that is not now the subject of successful study will later
    come to be. I think we probably today have under cultivation only a small
    part of the terrain which will be natural for the sciences a century from now.
    I think of the enormously rapid growth in many parts of biology, and of the
    fact, ominous but not without hope, that man is a part of nature and very
    open to study.

    5 The reason for this great change from a slowly moving, almost static
    world, to the world we live in, is the cumulative character, the firmness, the
    givenness of what has been learned about nature. It is true that it is tran-
    scended when one goes into other parts of experience. What is true on the
    scale of the inch and the centimeter may not be true on the scale of a billion
    light-years; it may not be true either on the scale of a one hundred billionth
    of a centimeter; but it stays true where it was proven. It is fixed. Thus every-
    thing that is found out is added to what was known before, enriches it, and
    does not have to be done over again. This essentially cumulative irreversible
    character of learning things is the hallmark of science.

    6 ‘This means that in man's history the sciences make changes which can-
    not be wished away and cannot be undone. Let me give two quite different
    examples. There is much talk about getting rid of atomic bombs. I like that
    talk; but we must not fool ourselves. The world will not be the same, no
    matter what we do with atomic bombs, because the knowledge of how to
    make them cannot be exorcised. It is there; and all our arrangements for
    living in a new age must reflect its omnipresent virtual presence, and the
    fact that one cannot change that. A different example: we can never have
    again the delusions about the centrality and importance of our physical hab-
    itat, now that we know something of where the earth is in the solar system,
    and know that there are hundreds of billions of suns in our galaxy, and hun-
    dreds of billions of galaxies within reach of the great telescopes of the world.
    We can never again base the dignity of man's life on the special character in
    space and time of the place where he happens to live.

    7 These are irreversible changes; so it is that the cumulative character gives
    a paradigm of something which is, in other respects, very much more subject
    to question: the idea of human progress. One cannot doubt that in the sci-
    ences the direction of growth is progress. This is true both of the knowledge
    of fact, the understanding of nature, and the knowledge of skill, of technol-
    ogy, of learning how to do things. When one applies this to the human situ-
    ation, and complains that we make great progress in automation and com-
    puting and space research but no comparable moral progress, this involves
    a total misunderstanding of the difference between the two kinds of progress.
    I do not mean that moral progress is impossible; but it is not, in any sense,
    automatic. Moral regress, as we have seen in our day, is just as possible. Sci-
    entific regress is not compatible with the continued practice of science.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Irreversible Scientific Change**\n\nThe text argues that scientific knowledge, once acquired, cannot be undone and has lasting implications for human society. Using the examples of atomic bombs and the understanding of Earth''s place in the universe, explain how these scientific developments have permanently altered humanity''s perception of its role in the cosmos.\n- **Step 1**: Analyze how the knowledge of atomic bomb technology is an example of a ''virtual presence'' that cannot be erased.\n- **Step 2**: Discuss how the discovery of Earth''s position in the galaxy changed humanity''s sense of self-worth and moral responsibility.\n- **Step 3**: Synthesize how these two examples together illustrate the irreversible nature of scientific progress and its impact on philosophical and ethical frameworks.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text''s key terms (e.g., ''virtual presence,'' ''irreversible changes'') and demonstrate a clear understanding of the author''s argument about scientific knowledge shaping human history.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Human Progress**\n\nThe author distinguishes between scientific progress and moral progress, arguing that the former is inevitable while the latter requires conscious effort. Using the text''s discussion on automation, computing, and space research, explain why moral progress is not ''automatic'' but must be actively pursued.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the text''s claim that scientific progress is ''direction of growth'' but moral progress is not.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast the author''s view with the common assumption that technological advancement inherently leads to moral improvement.\n- **Step 3**: Provide a logical argument that connects the inevitability of scientific progress with the possibility of moral regression.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference specific passages from the text (e.g., ''moral regress is just as possible'') and demonstrate an understanding of the author''s nuanced perspective on progress.

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Scientific Knowledge**\n\nThe text emphasizes that scientific knowledge is ''irreversible'' and has profound implications for human society. Create a counterargument to the author''s claim that ''scientific progress is inevitable and cannot be undone.''\n- **Step 1**: Identify the author''s key premises: scientific knowledge is inescapable and has lasting consequences.\n- **Step 2**: Propose a counterpoint based on the possibility of scientific ''regress'' or the reversal of knowledge.\n- **Step 3**: Use logical reasoning to evaluate whether scientific progress can be reversed or if it is truly inescapable, referencing the text''s discussion on ''virtual presence'' and ''irreversible changes.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly engage with the author''s arguments and demonstrate an ability to critically analyze the concept of scientific progress as presented in the text.'

    I think that we live in a time which has few historical parallels, that there are practical problems of human institutions, their obsolescence and their inadequacy, problems of the mind and spirit which, if not more difficult than ever before, are different, and difficult. I shall be dealing with some traits of the sciences which contribute to the difficulty, and may here give a synopsis of what they are.

Your answer must:\n- Reference the text''s claim that science is ''the same (with minor differences of emphasis)'' across countries.\n- Contrast this with the author''s belief that culture is ''not international'' and ''never quite will be.''\n- Provide an example of how these distinctions affect the development of scientific theories in different cultural contexts.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s key ideas without direct reference to the provided passage, using only the information given in the prompt and logical reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Logical Analysis of Science-Culture Relationship\n\nThe author argues that science and culture are not coextensive, meaning they are distinct entities. Using the text''s claims about science being ''useful but essentially unrelated to culture,'' construct an argument that explains why this distinction is important for understanding modern scientific practices.\n- **Part A**: Define ''coextensive'' based on the text''s context.\n- **Part B**: Provide a historical example from the text that illustrates how science and culture have evolved differently.\n- **Part C**: Explain how this distinction impacts the way scientific problems are approached in different cultural settings.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s arguments and show a clear understanding of the relationship between science, culture, and historical development.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Creative Problem Solving on Scientific Revolution\n\nThe text discusses the ''scientific revolution'' and its timing, suggesting that scientific progress is influenced by historical and cultural factors. Using the text''s mention of ''practical problems of human institutions'' and ''problems of the mind and spirit,'' create a hypothetical scenario where these factors shape the course of scientific discovery in a modern context.\n- **Part A**: Describe a modern scientific problem that is influenced by cultural and historical factors.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the characteristics of the scientific revolution (as described in the text) might apply to this modern problem.\n- **Part C**: Justify why the author''s view that science is ''not essentially related to culture'' might be challenged by this scenario.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a creative application of the text''s ideas to a modern context, showing an understanding of the author''s arguments and their implications.'

It started, as all serious historians would agree, in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, and was very slow at first. No great culture has been free of curiosity and reflection, of contemplation and thought. \"To know the cause of things\" is something that serious men have always wanted, a quest that serious societies have sustained. No great culture has been free of inventive genius. If we think of the culture of Greece, and the following Hellenistic and Roman period, it is particularly puzzling that the scientific revolution did not occur then. The Greeks discovered something without which our contemporary world would not be what it is: standards of rigor, the idea of proof, the idea of logical necessity, the idea that one thing implies another. Without that, science is very nearly impossible, for unless there is a quasi-rigid structure of implication and necessity, then if something turns out not to be what one expected, one will have no way of finding out where the wrong point is; one has no way of correcting himself, of finding the error. But this is something that the Greeks had very early in their history. They were curious and inventive; they did not experiment in the scale of modern days, but they did many experiments; they had as we have only recently learned to appreciate a very high degree of technical and technological sophistication. They could make very subtle and complicated instruments; and they did, though they did not write much about it. Possibly the Greeks did not make the scientific revolution because of some flaw in communication.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

    tion, but by what we know of it, it was very good. They were a small society;
    they talked freely with each other, and the record of these talks is even today
    an inspiring thing to read. It may be that there were not quite enough people
    involved.

    11 I believe that none of these may be the right answer. Indeed in a matter
    of history, we cannot assign a unique cause, precisely because the event itself
    is unique; you cannot test, to see if you have it right. I think that the best
    guess is that it took something that was not present in Chinese civilization,
    that was wholly absent in Indian civilization, and absent also from Greco-
    Roman civilization. It needed an idea of progress, not limited to better un-
    derstanding, for this idea the Greeks had. It took an idea of progress which
    has more to do with the human condition, which is well expressed by the
    second half of the famous Christian dichotomy—faith and works; the notion
    that the betterment of man's condition, his civility, had meaning; that we all
    had a responsibility to it, a duty to it, and to man. I think that it was when
    this basic idea of man's condition, which supplements the other worldly
    aspects of religion, when this was fortified and fructified between the Thir-
    teenth and the Fifteenth Centuries by the rediscovery of the ancient world,
    of the Greek scientists, philosophers, and mathematicians, that there was the
    beginning of the scientific age. It was very slow at first and marked by in-
    dividual giants, by Kepler, by Newton. By the Seventeenth Century there
    were enough men involved in improving human knowledge, or useful knowl-
    edge—phrases varied—so that new societies were formed, the Royal Society,
    the Academy, where people could talk to each other and bring to the prose-
    cution of science that indispensable element of working together, of com-
    munication, of correcting the other fellow's errors and admiring the other
    fellow's skills, thus creating the first truly scientific communities.

    The Sciences are small power; because not eminent; and therefore, not
    acknowledged in any man, nor one at all, but in a few; and in them, but
    of a few things. For Science is of that nature, as none can understand it
    to be, but such as in good measure have attained it.

    Arts of publique use, as Fortification, making of Engines, and other
    Instruments of War; because they conferre to Defence, and Victory, are
    Power.

    13 It was the next century that put science in a context of fraternity, even
    of universal brotherhood. It encouraged a political view which was egalitarian, permissive, pluralistic, liberal—everything for which the word demo-
    cratic is today justly and rightly used. The result is that the scientific world
    of today is also a very large one: an open world in which, of course, not
    everybody does everything, in which not everybody is a scientist or a prime
    minister, but in which we fight very hard against arbitrary exclusion of people
    from any works, any deliberation, any discourse, any responsibility for which
    their talents and their interests suit them. The result is that we face our new
    problems, created by the practical consequences of technology, and the great
    intellectual consequences of science itself, in the context of a world of two
    or three billion people, an enormous society for which human institutions
    were not really ever designed. We are facing a world in which growth is
    characteristic, not just of the sciences themselves, but of the economy, of
    technology, of all human institutions; no one can open a daily paper without
    seeing the consequences.

    14 One can measure scientific growth in a number of ways, but it is important not to mistake things. The excellence of the individual scientist does not change much with time. His knowledge and his power does, but not the high quality that makes him great. We do not look to anyone to be better than Kepler or Newton, any more than we look to anyone to be better than Sophocles, or to any doctrine to be better than the gospel according to St. Matthew or the Bhagavad-Gita. Yet one can measure things, and it has been done. One can measure how many people work on scientific questions: one can count them. One can notice how much is published.

    15 These two criteria show a doubling of scientific knowledge in every ten years. Casimir calculated that if the Physical Review continued to grow as rapidly as it has between 1945 and 1960, it would weigh more than the earth during the next century. In fifteen years, the volume of chemical abstracts has quadrupled; in biology the changes are faster still. Today, if you talk about scientists and mean by that people who have devoted their lives to the acquisition and application of new knowledge, then 93 per cent of us are still alive. This enormously rapid growth, sustained over two centuries, means, of course, that no man learned as a boy more than a small fraction in his own field of what he ought to know as a grown man.

    16 ‘There are several points to keep in mind. One would naturally think
    that if we are publishing so much, it must be trivial. I think that this is
    not true: any scientific community with sane people would protect itself
    against that, because we have to read what is published. The argument not
    to permit the accumulation of trivial, unimportant things which are not
    really new, which do not add to what was known before, is overwhelming.
    17 The second point is that one may say that every new thing renders what
    was known before uninteresting, that one can forget as rapidly as one learns.
    That is in part true: whenever there is a great new understanding, a great
    new element of order, a new theory, or a new law of nature, then much
    that before had to be remembered in isolation becomes connected and be-
    comes, to some extent, implied and simplified. Yet one cannot forget what
    went before, because usually the meaning of what is discovered in 1963 is
    to be found in terms of things that were discovered in 1955 or 1950 or earlier.
    These are the things in terms of which the new discoveries are made, the
    origins of the instruments that give us the new discoveries, the origins of the concepts in terms of which they are discovered, the origins of the language
    and the tradition.

    18 A third point: if one looks to the future of something that doubles every
    ten years, there must come a time when it stops, just as The Physical Review

    We cannot weigh more than the earth. We know that this will saturate, and
    probably at a level very much higher than today; there will come a time when
    the rate of growth of science is not such that in every ten years the amount
    that is known is doubled; but the amount that is added to knowledge then
    will be far greater than it is today. For this rate of growth suggests that,
    just as the professional must, if he is to remain professional, live a life of
    continuous study, so we may find a clue here also to the more general
    behavior of the intellectual with regard to his own affairs, and those of his
    colleagues in somewhat different fields. In the most practical way a man will
    have some choice: he may choose to continue to learn about his own field
    in an intimate, detailed, knowledgeable way, so that he knows what there
    is to know about it; but then the field will not be very wide. His knowledge
    will be highly partial of science as a whole, but very intimate and very com-
    plete of his own field. He may, on the other hand, choose to know generally,
    superficially a good deal about what goes on in science, but without compe-
    tence, without mastery, without intimacy, without depth. The reason for
    emphasizing this is that the cultural values of the life of science almost all
    lie in the intimate view: here are the new techniques, the hard lessons, the
    real choices, the great disappointments, the great discoveries.

    19 All sciences grow out of common sense, out of curiosity, observation,
    reflection. One starts by refining one's observation and one's words, and by
    exploring and pushing things a little further than they occur in ordinary life.
    In this novelty there are surprises; one revises the way one thinks about
    things to accommodate the surprises; then the old way of thinking gets to
    be so cumbersome and inappropriate that one realizes that there is a big
    change called for, and one recreates one's way of thinking about this part of
    nature.

    20 Through all this one learns to say what one has done, what one has
    found, and to be patient and wait for others to see if they find the same
    things, and to reduce, to the point where it really makes no further difference,
    the normally overpoweringly vital element of ambiguity in human speech.
    We live by being ambiguous, by not settling things because they do not have
    to be settled, by suggesting more than one thing because their copresence in
    the mind may be a source of beauty. But in talking about science one may
    be as ambiguous as ever until we come to the heart of it. Then we tell a
    fellow just what we did in terms that are intelligible to him, because he has
    been schooled to understand them, and we tell him just what we found and
    just how we did it. If he does not understand us, we go to visit him and
    help him; and if he still does not understand us, we go back home and do it
    over again. This is the way in which the firmness and solidity of science is

    established.
    266 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    21 How then does it go? In studying the different parts of nature, one ex-
    plores with different instruments, explores different objects, and one gets a
    branching of what at one time had been common talk, common sense. Each
    branch develops new instruments, ideas, words suitable for describing that
    part of the world of nature. This tree-like structure, all growing from the
    common trunk of man's common primordial experience, has branches no
    longer associated with the same question, nor the same words and techniques.
    The unity of science, apart from the fact that it all has a common origin in
    man's ordinary life, is not a unity of deriving one part from another, nor of
    finding an identity between one part and another, between let us say, genetics
    and topology, to take two impossible examples, where there is indeed some
    connection.

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Rhetorical Ambiguity and Scientific Clarity\n\nExplain how the text reconciles the ambiguity inherent in human speech with the clarity required in scientific communication. Use examples from both the passage''s discussion of ambiguity and its description of scientific methodology.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the core idea of ambiguity in human speech as presented in the first paragraph.\n- **Step 2**: Describe how scientific communication adopts a different approach to clarity, citing specific methods from the text (e.g., "we tell a fellow just what we did...").\n- **Step 3**: Connect these two ideas to explain how scientific discourse maintains ambiguity in conceptual terms but achieves clarity in explanation.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference both the ambiguity in human speech and the clarity in scientific communication as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Analysis of Scientific Branching and Unity\n\nThe text describes how scientific knowledge branches into distinct areas (e.g., genetics and topology) while maintaining a common origin in human experience.\n- **Part A**: Explain the metaphor of "tree-like structure" used in the text. How does this structure reflect both the diversity and unity of scientific knowledge?\n- **Part B**: Evaluate the claim that "the unity of science is not a unity of deriving one part from another" using examples from the text.\n- **Part C**: Propose a modern example of scientific branching that aligns with the text''s description, ensuring it reflects both specialization and shared foundational principles.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the metaphor of the tree-like structure and explicitly address the distinction between unity and diversity in science as presented in the text.'

    22 The unity consists of two things: first and ever more strikingly, an
    absence of inconsistency. Thus we may talk of life in terms of purpose and
    adaptation and function, but we have found in living things no tricks played
    upon the laws of physics and chemistry. We have found and I expect will
    find a total consistency, and between the different subjects, even as remote
    as genetics and topology, an occasional sharp mutual relevance. They throw
    light on each other; they have something to do with each other; often the
    greatest things in the sciences occur when two different discoveries made
    in different worlds turn out to have so much in common that they are
    examples of a still greater discovery.

    23 The image is not that of an ordered array of facts in which every one
    follows somehow from a more fundamental one. It is rather that of a living
    thing: a tree doing something that trees do not normally do, occasionally
    having the branches grow together and part again in a great network.

    24 The knowledge that is being increased in this extraordinary way is
    inherently and inevitably very specialized. It is different for the physicist,
    the astronomer, the microbiologist, the mathematician. There are connections:
    there is often important mutual relevance. Even in physics, where we fight
    very hard to keep the different parts of our subject from flying apart (so that
    one fellow will know one thing and another fellow will know another, and
    they do not talk to each other), we do not entirely succeed, in spite of a

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Scientific Knowledge as a Living System**\n\nBased on the text''s description of scientific knowledge, explain how the interplay between disciplines (e.g., genetics and topology) mirrors the growth of a tree in an unusual way.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two specific examples from the text that illustrate the ''living thing'' metaphor for science.\n- **Step 2**: Use these examples to argue how the tree''s growth (with branches that sometimes grow together and part again) represents the nature of scientific knowledge.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude by explaining how this metaphor suggests that science is both structured and dynamic, with specialized traditions yet capable of mutual relevance.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s main ideas and demonstrate an understanding of how scientific disciplines interact, even when they are specialized.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Scientific Specialization**\n\nThe text discusses the ''specialized traditions'' in science and how they contribute to scientific progress. Consider the following scenario: A physicist discovers a new law of motion, and a mathematician develops a new theorem that has potential applications in physics.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the ''passion for unity'' in science is evident in this scenario, using direct quotes from the text.\n- **Part B**: Justify why these two discoveries, despite their different disciplines, can still be considered part of the same ''tree'' of knowledge.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on ''mutual relevance'' challenges the idea that scientific disciplines are entirely separate.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s central argument about scientific specialization and its connection to broader knowledge.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Reasoning on Scientific Knowledge**\n\nThe text describes scientific knowledge as a ''tree'' with branches that sometimes grow together and part again. Construct an argument about how this metaphor can be extended to other domains (e.g., art, philosophy, or technology) and what this implies for interdisciplinary collaboration.\n- **Part A**: Choose one domain outside of science and explain how it can be seen as a ''tree'' with interconnected branches.\n- **Part B**: Use the text''s metaphor to argue why interdisciplinary collaboration is essential in solving complex problems.\n- **Part C**: Provide an example of a real-world problem that requires such collaboration and explain how the ''tree'' metaphor applies to its solution.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must show a deep understanding of the text''s metaphor and its relevance to broader intellectual pursuits.'

    Experience in its concepts and in its terminology, it is most highly specialized,
    almost unintelligible except to the men who have worked in the field. The
    great laws of physics today, which do not describe everything (or we would
    be out of business) but which underlie almost everything that is ever
    noticed in ordinary human experience about the physical world, cannot be
    formulated in terms that can reasonably be defined without a long period
    of careful schooling. This is comparably true in other subjects.

    25 One has then in these specializations the professional communities in
    the various sciences. They are very intimate, work closely together, know
    each other throughout the world. They are always excited, sometimes jealous
    but usually pleased, when one member of the community makes a discovery.
    I think, for instance, that what we now call psychology will one day perhaps
    be many sciences, that there will be many different specialized communities
    practising them, who will talk with one another, each in its own profession
    and in its own way.

    26 'These specialized communities, or guilds, are a very moving experience
    for those who participate. There have been many temptations to see analogues
    in them for other human activities. One that we hear much discussed is
    this: "If physicists can work together in countries with different cultures, in
    countries with different politics, in countries of different religions, even in
    countries which are politically obviously hostile, is not this a way to bring
    the world together?" It is certainly one of the few things we know how to
    do; we certainly should do it; we do. Yet it is, of course, a very fragile and
    limited way to bring the world together. I shall turn shortly to a generalization of this that is called for by our times.

    27 ‘The specializing habits of the sciences have, to some extent, because of
    the tricks of universities, been carried over to other work, to philosophy and
    to the arts. There is technical philosophy, which is philosophy as a craft,
    philosophy for other philosophers, and there is art for the artists and the
    critics. To my mind, whatever virtues the works have for sharpening pro-
    fessional tools, they are profound misreadings, even profound subversions
    of the true functions of philosophy and art, which are to address themselves
    to the general common human problem, not to everybody, but to anybody,
    not to specialists.

    28 As a final word on this account for structure and growth, it is clear that
    one is faced here with formidable problems of communication, of telling
    people about things, and of teaching. There is no escaping this. There is an
    immense job, never done, never ending, of teaching on all levels in every
    sense of the word.

    29 It has often been held that the great discoveries in science, coming into
    the lives of men, affect their attitudes toward their place in life, their views,

    their philosophy. There is surely some truth in this. Examples that are
    usually given include Newton and Darwin. Newton is not a very good ex-
    ample, for when we look at it closely we are struck by the fact that in the
    sense of the Enlightenment, the sense of a coupling of faith in scientific
    progress and man's reason with a belief in political progress and the secu-
    larization of human life, Newton himself was in no way a Newtonian. His
    successors were.

    30 If discoveries in science are to have an honest effect on human thought
    and on culture, they have to be understandable. That is likely to be true only
    in the early period of a science, when it is talking about things which are
    not too remote from ordinary experience. Some of the great discoveries of
    this century go under the name of relativity and uncertainty, and when we
    hear these words we may think, "This is the way I felt this morning: I was
    relatively confused and quite uncertain": this is not at all a notion of what
    technical points are involved in these great discoveries, or what lessons.

There is  \nanother requirement. Discoveries will really only resonate and change the  \nthinking of men when they feed some hope, some need that pre-exists in  \nthe society. I think that the real sources of the Enlightenment, fed a little by  \nthe scientific events of the time, came in the re-discovery of the classics, of  \nclassic political theory, perhaps most of all the Stoics. The hunger of the  \nEighteenth Century to believe in the power of reason, to wish to throw off  \nauthority, to wish to secularize, to take an optimistic view of man's condition,  \nseized on Newton and his discoveries as an illustration of something which  \nwas already deeply believed in quite apart from the law of gravity and the  \nlaws of motion.

    option of doing them all. This situation, which we all recognize, sustained
    in Bohr his long-held view of the human condition: that there are mutually
    exclusive ways of using our words, our minds, our souls, any one of which
    is open to us, but which cannot be combined; ways as different, for instance,
    as preparing to act and entering into an introspective search for the reasons
    for action. This discovery has not, I think, penetrated into general cultural
    life. I wish it had; it is a good example of something that would be relevant,
    if only it could be understood.

    33 Einstein once said that a physical theory was not determined by the
    facts of nature, but was a free invention of the human mind. This raises the
    question of how necessary is the content of science, how much is it some-
    thing that we are free not to find, how much is it something that could be
    otherwise? This is, of course, relevant to the question of how we may use
    the words objectivity and truth. Do we, when we find something, invent it
    or discover it?

    34 The fact is, of course, just what one would guess. We are, of course, free
    in our tradition and in our practice, and to a much more limited extent
    individually to decide where to look at nature, and how to look at nature,
    what questions to put, with what instruments and with what purpose. But
    we are not the least bit free to settle what we find. Man must certainly be free
    to invent the idea of mass, as Newton did and as it has been refined and
    redefined; but having done so, we have not been free to find that the mass
    of the light quantum or the neutrino is anything but zero. We are free in
    the start of things. We are free as to how to go about it; but then the rock of
    what the world is, shapes this freedom with a necessary answer. That is why
    ontological interpretations of the word objective have seemed useless, and
    why we use the word to describe the clarity, the lack of ambiguity, the
    effectiveness of the way we can tell each other about what we have found
    or not found.

- prompt: "35 Thus in the sciences, total statements like those that involve the word  \nall, with no qualifications, are hardly ever likely to occur. In every investiga-  \ntion or extension of knowledge we are involved in an action; in every action  \nwe are involved in a choice; and in every choice we are involved in a loss,  \nthe loss of that we did not do. We find this in the simplest situations. We  \nfind this in perception, where the possibility of perceiving is co-extensive with  \nour ignoring many things that are going on. We find it in speech where  \nthe possibility of understandable speech lies in paying no attention to a great  \ndeal that is in the air, among the sound waves, in the general scene. Mean-  \ning is always attained at the cost of leaving things out. We find it in the  \nidea of complementarity here in a sharp form as a recognition that the  \nattempt to make one sort of observation on an atomic system forecloses  \nothers. We have freedom of choice, but we have no escape from the fact  \nthat doing some things must leave out others.\n\n36 In practical terms, this means, of course, that our knowledge is finite  \nand never all-encompassing.

    38 The things that make us choose one set of questions, one branch of
    enquiry rather than another, are embodied in scientific traditions. In developed
    sciences each man has only a limited sense of freedom to shape or alter them;
    but they are not themselves wholly determined by the findings of science.
    They are largely of an aesthetic character. The words that we use, simplicity,
    elegance, beauty, indicate that what we grope for is not only more knowledge,
    but knowledge that has order and harmony in it, and continuity with the
    past. Like all poor fellows, we want to find something new, but not some-
    thing too new. It is when we fail in that, that the great discoveries follow.
    I should as a warning repeat that the fact that something is simple, elegant,
    and beautiful does not mean that it is true. That is another matter.

    39 All these themes—the origin of science, its pattern of growth, its branch-
    ing reticular structure, its increasing alienation from the common under-
    standing of man, its freedom, the character of its objectivity and its openness
    —are relevant to the relations of science and culture. I believe that they can
    be and should be far more robust, intimate, and fruitful than they are
    today.

    40 I am not here thinking of the popular subject of mass culture. In touch-
    ing on that, it seems to me one must be critical but one must, above all,
    be human; one must not be a snob; one must be rather tolerant and almost
    loving. It is a new problem; one must not expect it to be solved with the
    methods of Periclean Athens. In the problems of mass culture and, above all,
    of the mass media, it is not primarily a question of the absence of excellence.
    The modest worker, in the industrial world, has within reach probably better
    music and more good music, more good art, more good writing than his
    predecessors have ever had. It seems rather that the good things are lost in
    such a stream of poor things, that the noise level is so high, that some of the
    conditions for appreciating excellence are not present. One does not eat
    well unless one is hungry; there is a certain frugality to the best cooking;
    and something of this sort is wrong with the mass media. But that is not
    now my problem.

    41 Rather, I think loosely of what we may call the intellectual community:
    artists, philosophers, statesmen, teachers, men of most professions, prophets,
    scientists. This is an open group, with no sharp lines separating those that
    think themselves of it. It is a growing faction of all people. In it is vested
    the great duty for enlarging, preserving, and transmitting our knowledge
    and skills, and indeed our understanding of the interrelations, priorities,
    commitments, injunctions, that help men deal with their joys, temptations
    and sorrows, their finiteness, their beauty. Some of this has to do, as the
    sciences so largely do, with propositional truth, with propositions which say
    "If you do thus and so you will see this and that"; these are objective and
    can be checked and cross-checked until, though it is always wise from time
    to time to doubt, there are ways to put an end to the doubt. This is how
    it is with the sciences.

    42 In this community there are other statements which emphasize a theme
    rather than state a fact. They may be statements of connectedness or related-
    ness or importance, or they may be in one way or another statements of
    commitment. For them the word certitude, which is a natural norm to apply
    in the sciences, is not very sensible; depth, firmness, universality, perhaps
    more; but certitude, which applies really to verification, is not the great
    criterion in most of the work of a philosopher, a painter, a poet, or a play-
    wright. For these are not, in the sense I have outlined, objective. Yet for any
    true community, for any society worthy of the name, they must have an
    element of community, of being common, of being public, of being relevant
    and meaningful to man, not necessarily to everybody, but surely not just
    to specialists.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Community and Public Relevance**\n\nCorbett argues that the intellectual community must have ''an element of community, of being common, of being public, of being relevant and meaningful to man.''\n- **Part A**: Identify two examples from the text that demonstrate how artistic and philosophical works serve as ''public'' or ''common'' elements in society.\n- **Part B**: Explain why Corbett believes that philosophical and artistic works, despite not being ''objective,'' still contribute to the ''growth'' of the intellectual community.\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument that shows how the ''open'' nature of the intellectual community allows for diverse perspectives (scientific, artistic, philosophical) to coexist and enrich each other.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s emphasis on community, public relevance, and the role of different intellectual disciplines in a shared cultural framework.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving: The Role of Intellectual Communities**\n\nThe text describes the intellectual community as a ''growing faction of all people'' that includes artists, philosophers, scientists, etc.\n- **Part A**: Design a hypothetical scenario where a scientific discovery (e.g., a new mathematical theorem) is interpreted in different ways by artists, philosophers, and scientists. Describe how each group might respond to the discovery.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the ''open'' nature of the intellectual community allows for a ''growing'' faction, even as new members bring diverse perspectives and challenges.\n- **Part C**: Propose a solution to the problem of ''doubt'' mentioned in the text, using concepts from both scientific verification and thematic expression.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s themes of doubt, growth, and the interplay between different intellectual fields to create a coherent argument for the value of an open, diverse community.\n'

    43 I have been much concerned that, in this world of change and scientific
    growth, we have so largely lost the ability to talk with one another, to in-
    crease and enrich our common culture and understanding. And so it is that
    the public sector of our lives, what we hold and have in common, has suf-
    fered, as have the illumination of the arts, the deepening of justice and virtue,
    and the ennobling power of our common discourse. We are less men for
    this. Never in man's history have the specialized traditions more flourished
    than today. We have our private beauties. But in those high undertakings
    where man derives strength and insight from public excellence, we have
    272 DISCOVERY OF ARGUMENTS

    been impoverished. We hunger for nobility, the rare words and acts that
    harmonize simplicity with truth. In this default I see some connection with
    the great unresolved public problems—survival, liberty, fraternity.

    44 In this default I see the responsibility that the intellectual community
    has to history and to our fellows: a responsibility which is a necessary con-
    dition for remaking human institutions as they need to be remade today
    that there may be peace, that they may embody more fully those ethical
    commitments without which we cannot properly live as men.

    45 This may mean for the intellectual community a very much greater
    effort than in the past. The community will grow; but I think that also the
    quality and the excellence of what we do must grow. I think, in fact, that
    with the growing wealth of the world, and the possibility that it will not
    all be used to make new committees, there may indeed be true leisure, and
    that a high commitment on this leisure is that we reknit the discourse and
    the understanding between the members of the intellectual community.

    46 In this I think we have, all of us, to preserve our competence in our own
    professions, to preserve what we know intimately, to preserve our mastery.
    This is, in fact, our only anchor in honesty. We need also to be open to
    other and complementary lives, not intimidated by them and not contemptu-
    ous of them, as so many are today of the natural and mathematical sciences.
    As a start, we must learn again, without contempt and with great patience,
    to talk to one another; and we must hear.

    III "/ ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL

    Once the student has discovered, through the process of invention, or dis-
    covery of material, something to say on a given subject, he is faced with
    the problem of selecting and marshalling the available material in order to
    effect his purpose. Since usually he cannot, and should not, use all the
    material available to him, he has to select what is most pertinent and
    cogent. This selected material must then be put in some order, for without
    order the force of even the best material, though chosen with the keenest
    of discretion, will be weakened. The classical rhetoricians dealt with the
    problems of selection and arrangement under that part of rhetoric that the
    Greeks called taxis and the Latins called dispositio; we will use the term
    arrangement.

    If we are to profit from the classical precepts about dispositio, we must
    come to a clear understanding of what dispositio meant for the ancients. For
    many people, disposition means simply the study of the several parts of a
    discourse: (1) the exordium or introduction; (2) the narratio or statement
    of facts or circumstances that need to be known about the subject of our
    discourse; (3) the confirmatio or proof of our case; (4) the refutatio or
    discrediting of the opposing views; (5) the peroratio or conclusion. Classical
    rhetoric did deal with those parts and in that sequence; but it was concerned
    with something more. It was concerned also with the strategic planning of
    the whole composition.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Arrangement**\n\nUsing the concept of "arrangement" from classical rhetoric, design a speech structure for an argumentative essay on the topic: "The importance of preserving professional integrity in science and mathematics."\n- **Step 1**: Identify the appropriate rhetorical order (exordium, narratio, confirmatio, refutatio, peroratio) for this topic.\n- **Step 2**: For each section, explain how the content should be arranged and what purpose it serves in the argument.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how this structure reflects the strategic planning emphasized in classical rhetoric.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reference all five components of dispositio and demonstrate an understanding of their purpose in organizing a persuasive argument.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing the Purpose of Arrangement**\n\nExplain why classical rhetoric emphasizes the importance of arrangement in persuasion, using examples from the text.\n- **Part A**: Compare and contrast the role of arrangement in classical rhetoric with modern argumentative writing.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the strategic planning aspect of arrangement and provide an example of how it could be applied to a real-world scenario (e.g., a political speech or academic paper).\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s discussion of arrangement relates to the broader goal of "preserving our competence in our own professions."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concept of strategic planning from the text and apply it to a practical example.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Rhetorical Principles**\n\nDesign a public speech that addresses the issue of "contempt for natural and mathematical sciences" as discussed in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Outline the structure of your speech using the five parts of dispositio.\n- **Step 2**: For each part, include a specific rhetorical strategy that aligns with classical principles.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how your speech demonstrates the "strategic planning of the whole composition" as described in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the components of arrangement and show how they contribute to persuasive effectiveness.'

    Quintilian hints at the more important concern of disposition when he says that it is to oratory what generalship is to war. It would be folly to hold a general to a fixed, predetermined disposition of his forces. He must be left free to distribute his troops in the order and proportion best suited

    273

    274 ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL

    to cope with the situation in which he may find himself at any particular
    moment. So he will mass some of his troops at one point on the battle line,
    thin them out at other points, keep other troops in reserve, and perhaps
    concentrate his crack troops at the most crucial area. Guided by judgment
    and imagination, the general stands ready to make whatever adjustments in
    strategy eventualities may dictate.

    Cicero made explicit the twofold aspect of disposition when he said that
    the orator "ought first to find out what he should say; next to dispose and
    arrange his matter, not only in a certain order, but according to the weight
    of the matter and the judgment of the speaker" (De Oratore, I, 31). The
    person bent on persuasion will be guided in his decisions about the appro-
    priate disposition of his resources by a number of considerations:

    1. The kind of discourse in which he is engaged—whether delibera-
    tive, judicial, or ceremonial.

    2. The nature of his subject—a consideration which in turn will
    determine the quantity and quality of the matter available to him.

    3. His own éthos—his personality, his moral and philosophical bias,
    his limitations and capabilities.

    4. The nature of his audience—their age, their social, political, eco-
    nomic, and educational level, their mood at the moment.

    What all of this suggests is that disposition is what Aristotle meant by
    techne: an art by which one adapts means to an end.

    What the classical rhetoricians seemed to be striving for under dispositio
    was that "subsuming form" which Ronald S. Crane spoke of when he
    described his own experience in composing an essay. The passage deserves
    to be quoted in full:

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Disposition in Rhetorical Art**\n\nUsing the definitions and examples from the text, explain how disposition in rhetoric aligns with Aristotle''s concept of techne (art).\n- **Step 1**: Define ''techne'' as described by Aristotle in the context of rhetoric.\n- **Step 2**: Compare and contrast the role of disposition in oratory with that of generalship in war, as Quintilian describes.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example from the text that illustrates how a speaker adjusts their disposition based on audience and subject matter.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly connect the concept of techne to the adaptability required in disposition, using at least two examples from the text.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Disposition Principles**\n\nImagine you are preparing a speech for a diverse audience in a judicial context. Using the considerations listed in the text, outline the steps you would take to determine the appropriate disposition of your material.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the type of discourse (judicial) and its implications for structure.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the nature of your subject and how it should be prioritized.\n- **Step 3**: Consider the audience''s characteristics and how they might influence your arrangement.\n- **Step 4**: Justify how your disposition reflects the principles of techne as described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate all four considerations and demonstrate how each influences the disposition of your speech, using specific examples from the text.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Rhetorical Disposition**\n\nThe text suggests that disposition is an art (techne) requiring adaptation to the speaker''s éthos, audience, and subject. Construct a logical argument explaining why a rigid disposition is ineffective in rhetoric, using the following elements from the text:\n- **Premise 1**: Disposition must be flexible to adapt to changing circumstances (Quintilian''s analogy).\n- **Premise 2**: The speaker''s éthos influences the appropriate disposition (Cicero''s explanation).\n- **Conclusion**: A rigid disposition fails to achieve the purpose of persuasion.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must clearly state each premise and conclusion, reference specific parts of the text, and explain how they support the overall reasoning.

    The process of literary composition has often been rather crudely divided, especially by authors of textbooks on English writing, into two stages: a stage of preparatory reading, thinking, planning, incubation, and a stage of putting the materials thus assembled into words; and what happens in the second stage has usually been represented as a direct transfer to paper of the ideas or imaginations which the writer has come into possession of in the first stage—as a simple matter, that is, of giving to an acquired content an appropriate verbal form. I have myself taught this easy doctrine to students; but never, I believe, since I began to meditate on the disturbing fact that all too frequently, when I have attempted to write an essay after a long and interested concentration on the subject, and the noting of many exciting ideas and patterns of key terms, and the construction of what looked like a perfect outline, I have found myself unable to compose the first sentence, or even to know what it ought to be about, or, having forced myself to go on, to bring the thing to a satisfying conclusion, whereas, on other occasions, with no more complete preparation, no greater desire to write, and no better state of nerves, I have discovered, to my delight, that nearly everything fell swiftly into place, the right words came (or at any rate words which I couldn't change later on), and the sentences and paragraphs followed one another with scarcely a hitch and in an order that still seemed to me the inevitable one when I came to reread the essay in cold blood.

    I have had so many more experiences of the first sort than of the second that I have tried to isolate the reason for the difference. And the best way I can explain it is to say that what I failed to attain in the former cases and did somehow, at one moment or another of the total process, in the latter was a kind of intuitive glimpse of a possible subsuming form for the materials, or at least those I attached most importance to, which I had assembled in my mind and notes—a form sufficiently coherents and intelligible, as a form in my mind, so that I could know at once what I must or could do, and what I need not or ought not to do, in what order and with what emphasis in the various parts, in developing my arguments and putting them into words. I have never been able to write anything which seemed to me, in retrospect, to possess any quality of organic wholeness, however uninteresting or thin, except in response to such a synthesizing idea. It is more than a general intention, more than a "theme," and more than an outline in the usual sense of that word; it is, as I have said, a shaping or directing cause, involving at the same time, and in some sort of correlation, the particular conceptual form my subject is to take in my essay, the particular mode of argument or of rhetoric I am to use in discussing it, and the particular end my discussion is to serve: I must know, in some fashion, at least these three things before I can proceed with any ease or success.

    If Professor Crane's analysis of the writing process is accurate, composition would seem to exact from the writer a number of preliminary, as well as current, judgments and decisions. In Book VII, Chapter X of his Institutio Oratoria, Quintilian pointed out that disposition was concerned with judgments and decisions about questions like these:

    1. When is an introduction necessary and when can it be omitted or abbreviated?

    2. When should we make our statement of facts continuous and when should we break it up and insert it passim?

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical and Literary Structures**\n\nBased on Crane''s description of the writing process and Quintilian''s insights from *Institutio Oratoria*, analyze how a writer might structure an essay to achieve "organic wholeness" as described by Crane.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the three key elements of a "shaping or directing cause" according to Crane: conceptual form, mode of argument/rhetoric, and purpose.\n- **Step 2**: Relate these elements to Quintilian''s questions about introductions and the organization of facts.\n- **Step 3**: Provide a concrete example of how these elements interact in the construction of an essay.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate Crane''s concept of a synthesizing idea with Quintilian''s practical rhetorical strategies to demonstrate how they contribute to the cohesiveness of a written work.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Rhetorical Decision-Making in Composition**\n\nUsing the text from Crane and Quintilian, explain how a writer should decide when to include an introduction in an essay.\n- **Step 1**: Reference Crane''s assertion that a synthesizing idea must be "intuitive" and "coherents and intelligible."\n- **Step 2**: Apply Quintilian''s question about whether an introduction is necessary or can be abbreviated.\n- **Step 3**: Provide a scenario where omitting an introduction would undermine the essay''s "organic wholeness."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of both the conceptual and practical aspects of composition, showing how Crane''s theory informs Quintilian''s rhetorical advice.

    3. Under what circumstances can we omit the statement of facts altogether?

    4. When should we begin by dealing with the arguments advanced by our opponents and when should we begin by proposing our own arguments?

    5. When is it advisable to present our strongest arguments first and when is it best to begin with our weakest arguments and work up to our strongest?

    6. Which of our arguments will our audience readily accept and which of them must they be induced to accept?

    7. Should we attempt to refute our opponents' arguments as a whole or deal with them in detail?

    8. How much ethical appeal must we exert in order to conciliate the audience?

    9. Should we reserve our emotional appeals for the conclusion or distribute them throughout the discourse?

    10. What evidence or documents should we make use of and where in the discourse will this kind of argument be most effective?

    These and many other questions will confront the student when he sits down to plan his composition and will call forth all his powers of discretion to decide. The student's native good sense and intuition will be indispensable when he has to make crucial decisions about appropriate strategies, but rhetoric can lay down certain general principles to guide him at this stage. It remains for the student, however, to discern where and how these principles are applicable to a particular situation.

    It must be emphasized at this point that the disposition of one's material is not an indifferent matter. The importance of proper arrangement is pointed up by the incident in which the two great Athenian orators, Aeschines and Demosthenes, were engaged in an oratorical contest concerning Ctesiphon's proposal that Demosthenes be rewarded for his services with a golden crown. On that occasion, Aeschines proposed to the judges that Demosthenes be constrained to observe the same order of argument as he had followed in presenting his. But Demosthenes was quick to see that Aeschines' order would be disadvantageous to his own presentation. Accordingly, he pleaded with the judges to allow him to follow whatever order he saw fit. Demosthenes perceived that the arrangement of his arguments could be the decisive factor in the contest. The best of arguments could be weakened or nullified if inserted in the wrong place or if presented with inappropriate emphasis or proportion.

    The Parts of a Discourse

    Most rhetoricians recognized five parts for the usual argumentative discourse: exordium, narratio, confirmatio or probatio, refutatio, and peroratio. These terms were explained briefly in the introductory chapter of this book. In this text we will deal with four parts, using these labels: introduction, statement of fact, confirmation, and conclusion. This kind of partitioning of the discourse differs from the outlining system that the student may have learned. The outline is usually organized topically; this system of partitioning is determined by the functions of the various parts of a discourse.

    We will use these four parts as the organizing principle of this chapter, but in accordance with the classical view of dispositio, we will be constantly pointing out the adjustments that one may have to make in sequence, proportion, emphasis, and coloring to fit a particular subject, occasion, purpose, or audience.

    Introduction

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Logical Reasoning on Oratorial Structure**\n\nIn the context of classical rhetoric, analyze how Demosthenes'' strategic use of argument order influenced the outcome of his oratory contest with Aeschines.\n- **Step 1**: Explain the importance of dispositio (arrangement) in rhetoric as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Justify how changing the order of arguments could enhance or diminish the effectiveness of a discourse.\n- **Step 3**: Apply this principle to a hypothetical scenario where you need to present an argument. Describe how you would structure your speech to maximize persuasion, citing specific elements from the text (e.g., sequence, proportion, emphasis).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the classical view of dispositio and its application to real-world oratory.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Parts**\n\nUsing the four-part structure (introduction, statement of fact, confirmation, conclusion) from the text, compose a short argumentative discourse on the topic: ''The importance of proper education in democratic societies.''\n- **Step 1**: Craft an introduction that establishes the relevance of education in democracy.\n- **Step 2**: Present a statement of fact about the role of education in democratic societies.\n- **Step 3**: Provide confirmation through logical reasoning, citing possible sources or examples from the text.\n- **Step 4**: Conclude with a strong, persuasive statement about the necessity of education in democracy.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your discourse must adhere strictly to the four-part structure and incorporate elements of dispositio as discussed in the text.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Rhetorical Elements**\n\nCompare and contrast the classical five-part structure (exordium, narratio, confirmatio, refutatio, peroratio) with the four-part structure (introduction, statement of fact, confirmation, conclusion) presented in the text.\n- **Part A**: Explain how each part of the classical structure corresponds to the four-part structure.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how the text''s approach to dispositio differs from traditional outlining systems.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of this structural difference on the effectiveness of a discourse. Provide an example from the text that illustrates how structure can influence persuasion.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a deep understanding of both structures and their purposes in rhetoric.'

    Theologically, introduction means "a leading into." The Greek and Latin rhetorical terms for this part carried the same suggestion. The Greek term proemium meant "before the song"; the Latin term exordium meant "beginning a web"—by mounting a woof or laying a warp. The basic function then of the introduction is to lead the audience into the discourse. Instinctively we (cel that an abrupt, immediate entry into the body of our discourse would unsettle and confuse the audience. We sense that in most instances an audi- cce must, as it were, be "eased into" the subject of the discourse.

    Generally this preparation of the audience has a twofold aspect: (1) it informs the audience of the end or object of our discourse, and (2) it disposes the audience to be receptive to what we say. Conceivably, an audience could I~ well enough informed about a subject and sufficiently predisposed in our labor that the introduction could be made very brief or might be dispensed with entirely. Even under those conditions, however, most of us would feel that some kind of prelude was necessary—if nothing else a joke, an apt quotation, an entertaining anecdote, an ingratiating gesture toward the audi- cnee. Aristotle remarked that the introduction to some speeches was comparable to the preliminary flourishes that flute players made before their per- formance—an overture in which the musicians merely displayed what they could play best in order to gain the favor and attention of the audience for the main performance. Without this kind of "ornamental" introduction, the discourse would have an abrupt, negligent, unfinished air about it. So it is a rare discourse that plunges immediately into "the heart of the matter."

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Introduction''s Purpose and Function\n\nExplain the dual purpose of an introduction in rhetoric as described in the text, and how it serves to prepare the audience for the discourse.\n- **Part A**: Identify the two-fold aspect of introduction as outlined in the text (informing the audience of the end or object of discourse and disposing them to be receptive).\n- **Part B**: Provide an example from the text that illustrates how an introduction can serve both functions simultaneously, such as a joke or quotation.\n- **Part C**: Compare the introduction to the flute player''s preliminary flourishes mentioned in the text. Explain how this analogy supports the necessity of an introduction in rhetoric.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly articulate both functions and demonstrate understanding of the analogy provided in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Logical Analysis of Audience Preparation\n\nConsider the scenario where an audience is already well-informed about a subject and predisposed to our labor. According to the text, in such cases, could an introduction be dispensed with entirely?\n- **Part A**: Justify your answer based on the text''s statement that "even under those conditions, however, most of us would feel that some kind of prelude was necessary."\n- **Part B**: Construct a hypothetical example where an introduction might still be beneficial even if the audience is informed and predisposed.\n- **Part C**: Explain how an introduction can still serve the function of "ingratiating" toward the audience, even in cases where the audience is already familiar with the subject.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must address all three parts and demonstrate an understanding of the text''s argument regarding the necessity of introduction regardless of audience preparation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Creative Problem Solving in Rhetorical Structure\n\nDesign a rhetorical introduction for a speech on climate change that incorporates both the dual purpose of informing and preparing the audience, as well as the analogy to a flute player''s preliminary flourishes.\n- **Part A**: Begin with an engaging anecdote or quotation that illustrates the urgency of climate change.\n- **Part B**: Clearly state the purpose of the speech (informing the audience about the consequences of climate change and advocating for action).\n- **Part C**: Conclude with a metaphor that compares the introduction to the flute player''s preliminary performance, explaining how it sets up the main discourse.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your introduction must be original, demonstrate understanding of both the dual purpose and analogy from the text, and clearly show how each element serves its rhetorical function.'

- prompt: "Granting then that most compositions require some kind of prelude, let us  \nconsider the first of the two main functions of the introduction—informing  \nthe audience of the end or subject of our discourse. In doing this, we are  \nseeking to orient the audience, but, even more importantly, we are seeking  \nto convince the audience that the subject of our discourse is worthy of their  \nattention. We can render our subject attractive to the audience by showing  \nthat it is important, or momentous, or relevant to the interests of the audience,  \nor startling, or pleasant. The nature of the subject that we have to deal with  \nwill determine, of course, which of these topics we will exploit. A subject  \nthat is trifling cannot, by any exercise of ingenuity, be made to appear im-  \nportant or momentous. But a trifling subject could be made to appear agree-  \nable or exotic enough to warrant our attention.\n\nRichard Whately in his Elements of Rhetoric invented a number of terms  \nto designate the various kinds of introduction designed to arouse interest in  \nour subject:\n\n1. Introduction Inquisitive—to show that our subject is important,  \ncurious, or interesting.\n\nIn this example of the \"introduction inquisitive,\" Arnold J. Toynbee asks a  \nprovocative question and then seeks to sustain the interest of the reader by  \nsuggesting the importance to the modern world of the answer to that ques-\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Introduction Functions**\n\nGiven the dual function of an introduction as outlined in the text (orienting the audience and convincing them of the subject''s worth), construct a short rhetorical introduction for a speech about climate change.\n- **Step 1**: Begin with an inquisitive question that highlights the importance of the topic.\n- **Step 2**: Use a logical argument to connect the subject to current global issues.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a compelling statement that underscores the relevance to the audience''s interests.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your introduction must demonstrate an understanding of both functions and explicitly reference at least two rhetorical strategies from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Rhetorical Terms**\n\nExplain the distinction between an ''Introduction Inquisitive'' and an ''Introduction Explanatory'' as defined by Richard Whately.\n- **Part A**: Describe the purpose of an ''Introduction Inquisitive'' using examples from the text.\n- **Part B**: Contrast this with an ''Introduction Explanatory'' by providing a hypothetical example that demonstrates its function.\n- **Part C**: Justify why the text emphasizes the importance of arousing interest in the subject through these introductory strategies.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the definitions from the text and provide clear reasoning for each part.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Rhetorical Principles**\n\nDesign a rhetorical introduction for a speech about the importance of voting in a democracy.\n- **Step 1**: Begin with a startling statement that immediately captures attention.\n- **Step 2**: Use logical reasoning to connect the subject to the audience''s civic responsibilities.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a call to action that ties back to the initial statement.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your introduction must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s principles and explicitly reference at least two rhetorical strategies mentioned in the passage.'

    Does history repeat itself? In our Western world in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, this question used to be debated as an academic exercise. The spell of well-being which our civilization was enjoying at the time had dazzled our grandfathers into the quaint pharisaical notion that they were "not as other men are"; they had come to believe that our Western society was exempt from the possibility of falling into those mistakes and mishaps that have been the ruin of certain other civilizations whose history, from beginning to end, is an open book. To us, in our generation, the old question has rather suddenly taken on a new and very practical significance. We have awakened to the truth (how, one wonders, could we ever have been blind to it?) that Western man and his works are no more invulnerable than the now extinct civilizations of the Aztecs and the Incas, the Sumerians and the Hittites. So to-day, with some anxiety, we are searching the scriptures of the past to find whether they contain a lesson that we can decipher. Does history give us any information about our own prospects? And, if it does, what is the burden of it? Does it spell out for us an inexorable doom, which we can merely await with folded hands—resigning ourselves, as best we may, to a fate that we cannot avert or even modify by our own efforts? Or does it inform us, not of certainties, but of probabilities, or bare possibilities, in our own future? The practical difference is vast, for, on this second alternative, so far from being stunned into passivity, we should be roused to action. On this second alternative, the lesson of history would not be like an astrologer's horoscope; it would be like a navigator's chart, which affords the seafarer who has the intelligence to use it a much greater hope of avoiding shipwreck than when he was sailing blind, because it gives him the means, if he has the skill and courage to use them, of steering a course between charted rocks and reefs.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Interpretation of Historical Metaphors**\n\nAnalyze the metaphor ''history is a mirror'' as presented in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two specific instances where the author uses historical examples to reflect on contemporary issues.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how these instances demonstrate the function of history as a mirror in the context of Western civilization''s self-awareness.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the author believes that history is not a ''horoscope'' but a ''navigator''s chart'' in terms of guiding future actions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate at least two historical references from the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of the metaphorical significance of history.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Devices**\n\nExamine the rhetorical strategies used in the passage to convey the idea that history is not a deterministic force but a tool for action.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two rhetorical devices (e.g., analogy, metaphor, allusion) used to contrast the ''horoscope'' and ''navigator''s chart'' metaphors.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how the author uses these devices to argue against the deterministic view of history.\n- **Step 3**: Draw a parallel between the rhetorical strategies and their effect on the reader''s perception of historical responsibility.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include a clear analysis of two rhetorical devices and their impact on the reader''s understanding of historical agency.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Historical Lessons**\n\nEvaluate the author''s claim that history provides ''probabilities'' rather than ''certainties'' for future events.\n- **Step 1**: Summarize the author''s argument regarding the role of history in shaping present and future actions.\n- **Step 2**: Construct a logical argument that supports the author''s position using examples from the text.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a counterargument that challenges the author''s view and respond to it with reasoning based on the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the author''s position and provide a structured critique that reflects on the implications of viewing history as probabilistic rather than deterministic.'

    2. Introduction Paradoxical—to show that although the points we are trying to establish seem improbable, they must after all be admitted.

    Here, from the pen of the British drama critic Kenneth Tynan, is an example of the "introduction paradoxical":

    The most characteristic English play on the subject of physical love is Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra. It is characteristic because it has no love scenes. The English, as their drama represents them, are a nation endlessly communicative about love without ever enjoying it. Full-blooded physical relationships engaged in with mutual delight are theatically tabu. Thwarted love is preferred, the kind Mr. Coward wrote about in Brief Encounter, where two married people (married, of course, to two other people) form a sad and meagre attachment without being able to follow it through. At the end of a play on some quite different subject—religion, perhaps, or politics—it is customary for the hero to say, as he does in Robert's Wife: "I was deeply in love with a fine woman," and for the wife to reply: "My dear, dear husband"; but there should be no hint elsewhere in the text that they have as much as brushed lips.

    3. Introduction Corrective—to show that our subject has been neglected, misunderstood, or misrepresented.

    In the first paragraph of the following "introduction corrective," George Orwell states that there is general agreement about the problem but that there is widespread misunderstanding about the cause and the significance of the problem; then in the second paragraph Orwell suggests the "corrective" line that his essay will take:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Paradoxical Introduction Analysis**\n\nExplain the paradox in Tynan''s introduction to his essay on English drama and love.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the apparent contradiction in Tynan''s statement that ''the most characteristic English play on the subject of physical love is Shakespeare''s Antony and Cleopatra, which has no love scenes.''\n- **Step 2**: Justify why this is considered a paradox by discussing the cultural expectations of English drama regarding love and physical relationships.\n- **Step 3**: Connect this to the broader theme of how paradoxes can be used in introductions to challenge or reframe assumptions about a subject.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly demonstrate an understanding of the paradox and its significance in literary analysis.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Corrective Introduction Analysis**\n\nAnalyze Orwell''s ''introduction corrective'' from the text.\n- **Step 1**: Summarize Orwell''s main argument about the problem with English drama and the misunderstanding surrounding it.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how Orwell''s ''corrective'' line addresses the problem and what his essay aims to achieve.\n- **Step 3**: Compare and contrast Orwell''s approach with Tynan''s, focusing on how each uses an introduction to engage the reader differently.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the key points from both introductions and demonstrate analytical reasoning about their purposes and methods.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Analysis of Rhetorical Introductions**\n\nCompare and contrast the two types of introductions (paradoxical and corrective) as presented in the text.\n- **Part A**: Explain the purpose of each type of introduction and how they serve to engage the reader differently.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of a real-world situation where each type of introduction would be most effective and justify your choice.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the effectiveness of each type in challenging or redefining a subject, using specific details from Tynan''s and Orwell''s introductions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must show a deep understanding of both rhetorical strategies and their applications in literary analysis.'

    Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the
    English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we
    cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our civilization is dec-
    adent and our language—so the argument runs—must inevitably share
    in the general collapse. It follows that any struggle against the abuse of
    language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to electric
    light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the half-con-
    scious belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument
    which we shape for our own purposes.

    Now, it is clear that the decline of a language must ultimately have
    political and economic causes: it is not due simply to the bad influence
    of this or that individual writer. But an effect can become a cause, re-
    inforcing the original cause and producing the same effect in an inten-
    sified form, and so on indefinitely. A man may take to drink because he
    feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because
    he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English
    language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are fool-
    ish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have
    foolish thoughts. The point is that the process is reversible. Modern
    English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which spread by
    imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary
    trouble. If one gets rid of these habits one can think more clearly, and
    to think clearly is a necessary first step toward political regeneration: so
    that the fight against bad English is not frivolous and is not the exclusive
    concern of professional writers. I will come back to this presently, and
    I hope that by that time the meaning of what I have said here will have
    become clearer. Meanwhile, here are five specimens of the English lan-
    guage as it is now habitually written.

Introduction Preparatory—to explain an unusual mode of developing our subject; or to forestall some misconception of our purpose; or to apologize for some deficiencies.\n\nHere, in the first paragraph of Rachel Carson's The Sea Around Us, is an\nexample of the \"introduction preparatory,\" an introduction in which Miss\nCarson explains how she will proceed, lacking eye-witness accounts of the\nevent, in tracing the history of the beginning of the ocean:\n  \nINTRODUCTION 281\n\nBeginnings are apt to be shadowy, and so it is with the beginnings of\nthat great mother of life, the sea. Many people have debated how and\nwhen the earth got its ocean, and it is not surprising that their explana-\ntions do not always agree. For the plain and inescapable truth is that no\none was there to see, and in the absence of eye-witness accounts there\nis bound to be a certain amount of disagreement. So if I tell here the\nstory of how the young planet Earth acquired an ocean, it must be a\nstory pieced together from many sources and containing many whole\nchapters the details of which we can only imagine. The story is founded\non the testimony of the earth's most ancient rocks, which were young\nwhen the earth was young; on other evidence written on the face of the\nearth's satellite, the moon; and on hints contained in the history of the\nsun and the whole universe of star-filled space. For although no man\nwas there to witness this cosmic birth, the stars and the moon and the\nrocks were there, and, indeed, had much to do with the fact that there\nis an ocean.\n\nFrom The Sea Around Us, 1951.

    A light flashed on the central switchboard of the New York Telephone Company office in Forest Avenue, West Brighton, S. I., at precisely 2:04 A.M., September 2, 1958. Mrs. Catherine B. Thompson, one of the operators on duty, plugged in on the line. She heard the sound of heavy breathing. "Hello," she said, "hello." There was no answer, just that heavy, breathing sound. Mrs. Thompson turned to another operator, Mrs. Florence Parkin, and asked her to trace the call. Mrs. Parkin quickly found that it was coming from a house at 242 Vanderbilt Avenue. Then she cut in on the line, holding it open, while Mrs. Thompson notified police that something appeared to be wrong.

    Even as Mrs. Thompson was speaking to the desk sergeant at the St. George police station, Mrs. Parkin heard the labored breathing on the line turn into a voice. A woman gasped: "I've been stabbed."

    The operator immediately cut the police in on the conversation, and both she and the desk officer heard the woman repeat: "I've been stabbed. I've been attacked with a knife." A second later, the voice added: "My husband has been stabbed, too."

    Then there was silence. It lasted only a second. Then a new voice, a little boy's voice, came on the wire.

    "My mother is bleeding," the voice said.

    Mrs. Thompson told the boy police already were on the way.

    "Till wait for the police outside," he said.

    "No," she told him, "you better stay with your mother."

    Such was the beginning of a drama that was to shock the nation.

For each technique, explain how it contributes to the overall atmosphere of tension and mystery.\n- **Example 1**: The gradual pacing of the story (e.g., the slow build-up of the call, the use of silence)\n- **Example 2**: The use of limited information to prompt the reader''s imagination (e.g., descriptions of the breathing sound, the voice)\n- **Example 3**: The strategic placement of dialogue to create a sense of immediacy (e.g., the operator''s conversation with the caller)\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate specific details from the text and demonstrate an understanding of how rhetorical choices shape narrative effect.'

    These are the common ways in which authors rouse interest in their subject at the same time that they are informing their readers of the object of their discourse. Obviously, there will be times when we do not have to rouse interest in the subject. The subject may be sufficiently interesting in itself (did Dr. Kinsey have to generate interest in his report about the sexual behavior of men and women?). Or the particular circumstances may make the subject interesting (did Winston Churchill have to fan interest in his subject when he got up in the House of Commons to deliver his "Blood, Toil, Tears, and Sweat" speech'). Or a subject will have its own interest for a particular kind of audience (did the speaker at a convention of geneticists have to whip up an interest in his report on DNA, the element that may hold the key to the creation of human life in a test tube?). Considerations of this sort will determine whether the speaker or writer will have to spend any time in his introduction rousing interest in his subject.

    INGRATIATING ONESELF WITH THE AUDIENCE

    Even when we do not have to rouse interest in our subject, we may have to spend some time in the introduction establishing our credit with the audience. This function of the introduction, which the Latin rhetoricians called insinuatio, is closely tied up with the ethical appeal that a discourse must exert. Sometimes an author has to convince an audience that he is qualified to speak on some subject. At other times, he must counteract prejudices or misconceptions either about himself or about the subject of his discourse. Or he must rouse hostility toward those whose point of view he is going to oppose in his discourse.

    As the term insinuation suggests, the author must, in establishing his authority or counteracting prejudices, proceed with the utmost subtlety. To blatantly lay out his intellectual and moral qualifications—"to flaunt his clippings," as it were—could impress his audience as mere boasting and thereby nullify the intended effect of his recital. Good sense and good taste

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Strategies in Introduction**\n\nAn author is preparing to introduce a speech on the history of climate change. The audience includes scientists, policymakers, and the general public. Using the concepts from the text, explain how the author should approach the introduction in each of the following scenarios: \n- **Scenario 1**: The topic is inherently interesting to all audiences. \n- **Scenario 2**: The audience has preconceived notions that climate change is a hoax. \n- **Scenario 3**: The author is not an expert in climate science but has extensive experience in environmental policy. \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion on rousing interest and establishing credit, using specific examples from the text (e.g., Dr. Kinsey, Winston Churchill) and demonstrate an understanding of when to prioritize interest versus authority in the introduction.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Insinuation in Argumentation**\n\nAn author is writing an essay on the ethical implications of artificial intelligence. The audience is composed of both technologists and ethicists. The author must address two competing viewpoints: 1) AI is a neutral tool that should be regulated by policymakers, and 2) AI development should be left to experts in the field. Using the text''s discussion on insinuation, compose a paragraph that: \n- **Part A**: Establishes the author''s credibility by subtly referencing their background in both technology and ethics. \n- **Part B**: Addresses the opposing viewpoints without explicitly stating them, using insinuation to guide the reader''s understanding. \n- **Part C**: Concludes with a statement that subtly implies the author''s position without overtly stating it. \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reflect the text''s emphasis on subtlety in insinuation, using examples from the text (e.g., ''to flaunt his clippings'') to explain how insinuation differs from direct assertion.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Functions**\n\nThe text discusses two main functions of an introduction: rousing interest in the subject and establishing credit with the audience. Consider a hypothetical speech on the topic of nuclear energy, given by an expert in physics to a mixed audience of engineers and laypeople. \n- **Part A**: Explain how the speech should balance the two functions in its introduction, using examples from the text (e.g., Dr. Kinsey''s report on sexual behavior). \n- **Part B**: Construct a counterexample to the claim that ''all introductions must focus on rousing interest.'' Your example should demonstrate a scenario where establishing credit is the primary function. \n- **Part C**: Analyze how the text''s distinction between ''insinuation'' and ''flaunting credentials'' affects the effectiveness of an introduction in different contexts. \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a deep understanding of the text''s rhetorical strategies, using logical reasoning to connect the concepts of interest, authority, and subtlety in communication.'

    must guide the writer in presenting his credentials. An audience will usually
    accept a man's display of his qualifying credentials if he recites the facts
    with due restraint and a becoming humility. The man who says, "I have
    spent fifteen years studying the problems of juvenile delinquency in such
    cities as New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles," will do more to establish
    his qualifications than the man who says, "My thoroughgoing studies of the
    problems of juvenile delinquency in many parts of the country have com-
    pletely discredited the half-baked notions of those who have investigated
    the problems with more zeal than wisdom." The man who jingles his Phi
    Beta Kappa key usually stirs up more resentment than confidence.

    In the following example, we observe C. P. Snow modestly presenting his
    qualifications to write about "the two cultures," the sciences and the humani-
    ties.

    It is about three years since I made a sketch in print of a problem
    which had been on my mind for some time. It was a problem I could
    not avoid just because of the circumstances of my life. The only creden-
    tials I had to ruminate on the subject at all came through those circum-
    stances, through nothing more than a set of chances. Anyone with similar
    experience would have seen much the same things and I think made very
    much the same comments about them. It just happened to be an unusual
    experience. By training I was a scientist; by vocation I was a writer.

    But my personal history isn't the point now. All that I need say is
    that I came to Cambridge and did a bit of research here at a time of
    major scientific activity. I was privileged to have a ringside view of one
    of the most wonderful creative periods in all physics. And it happened
    through the flukes of war—including meeting W. L. Bragg in the buffet
    on Kettering station on a very cold morning in 1939, which had a deter-
    mining influence on my practical life—that I was able, and indeed
    morally forced, to keep that ringside view ever since. So for thirty years
    I have had to be in touch with scientists not only out of curiosity, but
    as a part of a working existence. During the same thirty years I was try-
    ing to shape the books I wanted to write, which in due course took me
    among writers.

    The man who has to minimize prejudices against him must be equally
    discreet, but he can usually be more open-handed than the man who has
    to establish his qualifications. No one resents the man who openly strives
    to clear himself of charges and misconceptions. An audience's natural sense
    of fair play stands ready to hear "the other side of the story."

    284 § ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL

    In seeking to remove prejudices, the speaker or writer has a number of
    courses open to him. He can

    deny the charges that have created the prejudices against him.
    admit the charges but deny their alleged magnitude.

    cite a compensating virtue or action.

    attribute the discrediting action to an honest mistake on his part
    or to an accident or to an inescapable compulsion.

    5. cite others who were guilty of the same thing but were not so
    charged.

    substitute a different motive or cause for the one alleged.
    inveigh against calumny and malicious insinuation in general.
    cite the testimony of those who take a different view of the
    matter.

    Here is a short example of a man seeking to remove a prejudice against him. Because of his sympathetic writings about the American colonists, Edmund Burke, the great British Parliamentarian, was suspected of pro-American tendencies and of grounding his sympathies not so much on abstract principles as on considerations of expediency. Note how he meets these charges:

    I am charged with being an American. If warm affection towards those over whom I claim any share of authority be a crime, I am guilty of this charge. But I do assure you (and they who know me publicly and privately will bear witness to me) that if ever one man lived more zealous than another for the supremacy of Parliament and the rights of this imperial crown, it was myself. Many others indeed might be more knowing in the extent or the foundation of these rights. I do not pretend to be an antiquary, a lawyer, or qualified for the chair of professor in metaphysics. I never ventured to put your solid interests upon speculative grounds. My having constantly declined to do so has been attributed to my incapacity for such disquisitions; and I am inclined to believe it is partly the cause. I never shall be ashamed to confess that where I am ignorant I am diffident. I am indeed not very solicitous to clear myself of this imputed incapacity, because men even less conversant than I am in this kind of subtleties and placed in stations to which I ought not to aspire, have, by the mere force of civil discretion, often conducted the affairs of great nations with distinguished felicity and glory.

    Arousing hostility against one's opponent is usually more effective in the conclusion than in the introduction, for it is easier to discredit a man's ethos after one has demolished his arguments. But sometimes it is more expedient

    To stir up animosity in the introduction. If circumstances make it difficult or impossible to clear oneself of prejudices or suspicion, one might be able to gain a hearing by showing that one's opponent is a fool or a knave. And this is best done in the introduction. We saw how Socrates early in the Apology sought to raise suspicions about Meletus's integrity. Socrates thereby "softened up" the audience for his subsequent refutation of Meletus's charges.

    In these opening paragraphs of The Rights of Man (1791-92), Thomas Paine is seeking to prejudice the audience against Edmund Burke, the man whose political and social views Paine is going to attack in the main body of his book:

    Among the incivilities by which nations or individuals provoke and irritate each other, Mr. Burke's pamphlet on the French Revolution [Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790)] is an extraordinary instance. Neither the people of France nor the National Assembly were troubling themselves about the affairs of England or the English Parliament; and that Mr. Burke should commence an unprovoked attack upon them, both in Parliament and in public, is a conduct that cannot be pardoned on the score of manners, nor justified on that of policy.

    There is scarcely an epithet of abuse to be found in the English language with which Mr. Burke has not loaded the French nation and the National Assembly. Everything which rancor, prejudice, ignorance, or knowledge could suggest is poured forth in the copious fury of near four hundred pages. In the strain and on the plan Mr. Burke was writing, he might have written on to as many thousands. When the tongue or the pen is let loose in a frenzy of passion, it is the man, and not the subject, that becomes exhausted.

Explain how Paine''s use of prejudice serves as a rhetorical strategy in the context of classical rhetoric, citing specific examples from the text.\n- **Example 1**: Paine describes Burke''s pamphlet as "an extraordinary instance" of incivility. Justify how this label is a form of prejudice and its purpose in swaying the audience.\n- **Example 2**: Paine states that Burke "loaded the French nation and the National Assembly" with epithets. Analyze how this hyperbolic language is a form of prejudice and its effect on the audience''s perception.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of classical rhetoric and how prejudice is used as a strategy to influence the audience, with clear textual references.'

    Hitherto Mr. Burke has been mistaken and disappointed in the opinions he had formed of the affairs of France, but such is the ingenuity of his hope, or the malignancy of his despair, that it furnishes him with new pretenses to go on. There was a time when it was impossible to make Mr. Burke believe there would be any revolution in France. His opinion then was that the French had neither spirit to undertake it nor fortitude to support it; and now that there is one, he seeks an escape by condemning it.

    What we have been saying about the content and strategy of the introduction adds up to this: the introduction seeks to render the audience attentive, benevolent—that is, well-disposed toward the writer and his cause, and docile—that is, ready to be instructed or persuaded. In order to determine what must be done in the introduction to effect these ends, we must consider (1) what we have to say, (2) before whom, (3) under what circumstances, (4) what the prepossessions of the audience are likely to be, (5) how much time or space has been allotted to us. An honest confrontation of those considerations will tell us, not only what we must do in the introduction but how long it has to be. If we see that there is no need to render our audience attentive, benevolent, and docile, our introduction can be very brief—a few ingratiating flourishes and a brief statement of the thesis. But if the occasion demands that the audience be "conditioned," then our introduction may have to be more elaborate.

    One caution needs to be stressed here: introductions tend to be dispro-
    portionately long. At some time or other, the student has probably heard the
    classic advice, "Throw away the first page of your rough draft and begin
    your final draft at the top of page two." Obviously we cannot follow this
    advice in any mechanical fashion, but the principle here is fundamentally
    sound. Our first draft is often encumbered with excess fat. One of the
    reasons why a long "warming up" is so common is that there is a natural
    inertia to be overcome before we can get under way. Often it is the student
    with little to say on an assigned topic who produces the top-heavy introduc-
    tion. He has 800 words to write. If he can spend 400 of these words on
    preliminaries, he can put off that formidable moment when he has to get
    down to the subject...and then there are only 400 words to go! If the
    discipline of the topics can fill up the "dry wells," perhaps we can prevent
    this tendency to pad the introduction.

    Allotted wordage is becoming more and more a major consideration in
    the determination of the length of introductions. Since space is at such a
    premium in modern newspapers and magazines, editors are insisting on
    strict observance of specified word limits. It may be that the nature of our
    subject or of our audience calls for a fairly elaborate introduction, but we
    have been asked to develop our thesis in 1200 words. So we shall have to
    ignore the exigency and get into the body of our discourse as soon as possible.
    One's writing can profit from the discipline of observing word-limits: nothing
    serves better to trim the fat from one's prose. Anyone who has been required
    to write book reviews in 300 to 350 words soon learns many salutary lessons
    about economy of means.

    No mention has been made so far of the kind of opening that immediately captures the reader's interest. In books on the technique of fiction or the feature story, this kind of opening is often called "the hook." A provocative question, a startling hyperbole, an intriguing paradox—these are some of the devices we are advised to use in order to buttonhole our reader. Norman Cousins uses the provocative question effectively in the opening paragraphs of his article "Don't Resign from the Human Race":

    Have you ever wondered what you would say if you were suddenly called upon to defend the human race?

    Suppose you were invited to participate in a great debate or, better still, a mock court trial called for the purpose of deciding whether the human species had justified its right to survive—whether, on the basis of its virtues and weaknesses, it was actually entitled to the gift of life. Suppose your job was that of attorney for the defense. How would you go about collecting your evidence? What witnesses would you call? What arguments would you use?

    From Saturday Review, August 7, 1948. Reprinted by permission of the SATURDAY REVIEW, 25 West 45th Street, New York.

    There are a number of reasons why such an opening is an attention-getter. First, although the initial question is a rhetorical question—a type that does not require a direct and immediate answer from the audience or reader—it does challenge the audience, make them more alert. Another reason for the effectiveness of this particular question is that it is both an unusual question—imagine suggesting that the human race has to justify its right to existence!—and an important one—it may concern our very existence. So the elements of surprise and importance are contributing to the effectiveness of the gambit. The second paragraph further challenges us by posing a hypothetical situation: suppose you were called upon to be the defense attorney for the human race. The final three questions suggest some of the problems that would face us in that capacity. So these opening paragraphs both alert us and disconcert us. Challenged by the importance of the question asked and perhaps somewhat chagrined that we do not have a ready answer for this important question, we are now "set up" to listen to this man's answer.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**The Human Race Defense Argument**\n\nImagine you are the defense attorney for the human race, tasked with proving that our species has a right to exist. Using the opening paragraphs of Norman Cousins'' article, construct an argument that addresses the following points:\n- **Point 1**: How would you counter the claim that humanity is inherently destructive and immoral?\n- **Point 2**: What evidence would you present to support the idea that humans have contributed positively to the world?\n- **Point 3**: How would you address the ethical dilemma of whether the human race should continue to exist?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the rhetorical strategies and themes from the text, demonstrating an understanding of how the opening paragraphs set up the debate and challenge the reader''s assumptions.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**The Power of a Rhetorical Question**\n\nExplain how the use of rhetorical questions in Cousins'' opening paragraphs serves to engage the reader. In your answer, address the following:\n- **Part A**: Why is a rhetorical question effective in this context?\n- **Part B**: What elements of surprise and importance does the text highlight as contributing to the effectiveness of this opening?\n- **Part C**: How does the rhetorical question create a sense of urgency and responsibility in the reader?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must analyze the rhetorical strategies used and their purpose, demonstrating an understanding of classical rhetoric as outlined in the text.\n'

    The student must exercise good taste and judgment when he searches for
    the opening calculated to arrest attention. The overtly and excessively clever
    opening can repel readers rather than engage them. (The New Yorker, in
    one of its regular filler features, has a label for such brashly clever openings—
    Letters We Never Finished Reading.) As usual, the most reliable guide in
    regard to attractive openings is the nature and temper of the audience.

    The closing lines of the introduction should be so managed that they lead
    easily and naturally into the next division of the discourse. The problem of
    transition is basically one of coherence. We want the parts of our discourse
    to "hang together," and while we would like the sutures to be as unobtrusive
    as possible, we nevertheless want our readers to be aware that they are passing
    over into another division of the discourse. Aristotle himself, that great
    master of exposition, is not at all hesitant about marking his transitions
    explicitly. For instance, at the end of Chapter 1 in Book I of the Rhetoric
    he says, "Let us now try to give some account of the systematic principles of
    rhetoric itself—of the right method and means of succeeding in the object
    set before us. We must make as it were a fresh start, and before going
    further define what rhetoric is." Throughout the Rhetoric—in fact, through-
    out most of his treatises—Aristotle carefully plants these transitional markers
    —often at the end of a chapter, sometimes at the beginning of a new
    chapter, occasionally at divisions of an especially long and involved exposition.
    Sometimes, just the logical development of our thought allows us to
    glide into the next division without our having to use "pointers." No rule-
    of-thumb can be laid down to tell us when it is best to mark our transitions
    explicitly and when we can rely on the logic of our thought development
    to carry the reader over into the next division. In this respect—as we have
    seen so often in the discussion of rhetorical strategies—the particular situation
    will dictate its own exigencies.

    One final point about introductions. The things we strive to do in the introduction—to render the audience attentive, benevolent, and docile—have sometimes to be done at various points in the discourse, especially in long discourses. As some of the rhetoricians observed, it is sometimes more necessary to make a play for the attention of the audience at a later stage in the discourse than it is in the introduction. In fact, we can usually rely on a certain natural attentiveness in our audience at the beginning of our discourse, which may flag as we continue. In that case, we may have to pull our audience up again. Likewise, when we are about to launch forth into a particularly delicate argument, we may have to make another play for the good will of our audience.

    Statement of Fact

    We have used the term statement of fact to designate the second division of a discourse for want of a better term to translate the Latin narratio. Narration has taken on meanings for us that it did not have for the Romans. Statement of fact has its own ambiguities for us, but the term suggests more accurately than does narration what it is that we do in this part of expository and argumentative prose.

    Statement of fact figured principally in forensic oratory. In this division of a forensic speech, the advocate set forth the essential facts of the case under consideration. "On the night of March 15," we can imagine him saying, "Gaius Maximus was murdered in a back alley off the Forum. It has been alleged that my client, who was seen in the Forum that evening and who was known to be a political enemy of the deceased, was the murderer. Suspicion about my client has not been dispelled by the revelation that at the time of the murder my client was seen...." If the prosecuting lawyer had previously set forth these facts, the defending lawyer might use this part in his speech to add pertinent facts or to correct details in the prosecution's statement. In a court trial, what often initiates this part of the trial is the reading of the formal indictment against the defendant—in other words, the defining

    of the issue in the case. For example, here was the indictment read by Attorney General A. T. Stewart on the second day of the "Monkey Trial" in July
    1925—a trial that became a cause célébre partly because of the conflict that

    developed in the courtroom between William Jennings Bryan and Clarence
    Darrow:

    That John Thomas Scopes, heretofore on the 24th of April, 1925, in
    the county aforesaid, then and there, unlawfully did wilfully teach
    in the public schools of Rhea County, Tennessee, which said public
    schools are supported in part and in whole by the public school fund of
    the state, a certain theory and theories that deny the story of the divine
    creation of man as taught in the Bible, and did teach instead thereof that
    man has descended from a lower order of animals, he, the said John
    Thomas Scopes, being at the time, and prior thereto, a teacher in the
    public schools of Rhea County, Tennessee, aforesaid, against the peace
    and dignity of the State.

    Anyone familiar with the trial or with Inherit the Wind, the play based on
    the trial, knows that the argument frequently drifted far from the charge
    specified in that indictment. But despite all the pyrotechnic oratory about the
    larger issues involved in this case, the jury did eventually return a verdict of
    "guilty as charged."

    Since the province of forensic discourse is the past, there is usually a set of
    facts or details to be recited for the benefit of the judge and jury. Ordinarily
    these "facts" have to be stated before they can be proved or refuted, and so
    narratio became a regular part of the oratory of the courtroom. Deliberative
    oratory, on the other hand, deals with the future, and consequently there are,
    strictly speaking, no "facts" to be recited. Because deliberative oratory argues
    about things that must be done, rather than things that have been done, nar-
    ratio was regarded as an unnecessary, certainly as a dispensable, part of this
    kind of speech.

    But the deliberative orator—and the ceremonial orator too—often felt the
    need to recite past events as a basis for his recommendations about the future.
    As a result, narratio began to figure in deliberative and ceremonial oratory
    as well as in forensic. Whether or not statement of fact is a necessary part of
    deliberative or ceremonial discourse is debatable; but the fact of the matter
    is that most discourses, of whatever kind, do devote a section—the one im-
    mediately following the introduction—to a statement of fact. Recognizing
    that a statement of fact can often be dispensed with, let us go on to consider
    what is done and in what manner in this part of a discourse.

    The statement of fact is fundamentally expository. In this section we are
    informing our readers of the circumstances that need to be known about our
    subject. If the readers are sufficiently informed about the subject under con-
    sideration, we can dispense with this part altogether. But most of the time,
    even well-informed readers will appreciate, even if they do not require, some
    recital of the circumstances, the details, the state of the question.

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Rhetorical Functions\n\nIn the text, it is stated that narratio (the statement of fact) is a regular part of forensic oratory but considered unnecessary in deliberative oratory. However, both the deliberative and ceremonial orators often use past events to justify their recommendations for the future.\n- **Part A**: Explain why narratio is considered a necessary component of forensic discourse but not deliberative discourse, using the text''s distinction between past and future-based arguments.\n- **Part B**: Construct a hypothetical scenario where a deliberative orator would still need to use narratio, and justify why this is logically consistent with the text''s argument.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on narratio as a foundational element of discourse, even when not strictly necessary, contributes to the overall effectiveness of public speaking.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s definitions of forensic and deliberative oratory, demonstrate understanding of the role of narratio in different contexts, and provide a logically sound argument for your hypothetical scenario.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Critical Analysis of Rhetorical Structure\n\nThe text argues that the statement of fact (narratio) is fundamentally expository, but not always necessary. However, it acknowledges that most discourses do include this section as part of their structure.\n- **Part A**: Compare and contrast the role of narratio in forensic, deliberative, and ceremonial oratory as described in the text.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the implications of the statement: "Even well-informed readers will appreciate, even if they do not require, some recital of the circumstances". Use this to argue whether narratio is more about informing or persuading, and why.\n- **Part C**: Propose a revision to the text''s argument that would make narratio more optional in all forms of discourse. Explain your reasoning based on the text''s premises.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s arguments, provide a logical analysis of each part, and propose a revision that aligns with the text''s reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Application of Rhetorical Logic\n\nThe text suggests that narratio is often unnecessary but still commonly used in discourse. The author argues that this is because the statement of fact can be dispensed with, but in practice it is included.\n- **Part A**: Using the text''s reasoning, explain why a ceremonial orator might feel compelled to include narratio even if it is not strictly necessary.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument that shows how the inclusion of narratio, even when not required, can enhance the persuasiveness of a speech. Your argument must reference at least two elements of the text''s discussion on expository and persuasive functions.\n- **Part C**: Propose a counterargument to the author''s claim that narratio is often unnecessary. Your counterargument must be based on the text''s own reasoning and not external knowledge.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s definitions of narratio and its functions, provide a logical argument for your counterargument, and demonstrate an understanding of the author''s position on rhetorical structure.'

    It is customary for authors of scholarly articles to summarize briefly the history of the idea they are going to discuss in their article. Here is an example of that kind of statement of fact from an article entitled "Charles Lamb's Contribution to the Theory of Dramatic Illusion." The final sentence of the author's introduction provides a transition to the statement of fact: "Before discussing Lamb's view, which was the product of numerous visits to the playhouse, it would be well to keep in mind the broad outlines of the main theories advanced before the Romantic period." The article continues:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Historical Rhetorical Theories**\n\nExplain how the author''s introduction sets up the discussion of Charles Lamb''s contribution by referencing the historical context provided in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key historical theories mentioned in the introduction that preceded Lamb''s views.\n- **Step 2**: Justify why understanding these theories is essential for interpreting Lamb''s contributions.\n- **Step 3**: Connect the author''s statement to the broader purpose of the article, which is to explore Lamb''s role in dramatic illusion theory.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the historical theories and demonstrate an understanding of their relevance to Lamb''s work.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nUsing the principles of classical rhetoric outlined in the text, construct an argument that combines ethos, pathos, and logos to persuade a modern audience about the importance of dramatic illusion in theater.\n- **Step 1**: Define each rhetorical mode (ethos, pathos, logos) using the text''s definitions.\n- **Step 2**: Provide a logical argument (logos) that demonstrates the effectiveness of dramatic illusion in storytelling.\n- **Step 3**: Incorporate an emotional appeal (pathos) that highlights the audience''s connection to performances.\n- **Step 4**: Establish credibility (ethos) by referencing the historical significance of dramatic illusion in classical rhetoric.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be structured using the three rhetorical modes as defined in the text and show a clear application to modern theater.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Rhetorical Theories**\n\nEvaluate the author''s claim that Lamb''s views on dramatic illusion were shaped by his experiences in the playhouse.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the evidence in the text that supports this claim (e.g., references to Lamb''s visits to the playhouse).\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how these experiences influenced his theoretical perspective.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this to the broader historical context of dramatic illusion theories before the Romantic period.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your evaluation must demonstrate an understanding of both Lamb''s personal experiences and the historical development of dramatic illusion theory, as presented in the text.'

- prompt: "Neo-classical theory was committed, or thought it was committed, to advocating the dramatic unities of time, place, and action because it insisted upon the necessity of literal delusion. As might be expected, the late seventeenth century emphasized the rational aspect of the unities: it is unreasonable, the argument ran, to think that a spectator is able to pretend that the events of two days can be crowded into a few hours, or to demand that the audience, having transported itself to Asia, should be required to leap to Africa a few moments later. To make such demands is unfair, and to think that an audience can comply with them is, this view maintains, unreasonable. But in the eighteenth century a reply was evolved which gained increasing acceptance with audiences and with literary critics. Reasonable or not, this counterargument said, the mind can transport itself as easily to Africa from Asia as it can journey to Asia in the first place. The problem is not one of \"reason\" or \"reasonableness,\" but of what, in fact (not in theory), the imagination is capable of doing. Dr. Johnson is somewhat in this second tradition, but he goes further than merely saying that the mind can hop about from place to place and condense time and space at its will. He insists that the playwright should not encumber himself with the unities (which at best might prevent a man from being a bad playwright, but could never make him a good one), but he denied that the spectator is literally deluded (by imagination or by reason) into believing he is watching a reality and not a play. Such is Johnson's broad theoretical generalization.\nWe should perhaps keep in mind his practice—his reluctance, for example, to read King Lear, because Cordelia's death caused him such pain.\n\nFrom Sylvan Barnet, \"Charles Lamb's Contribution to the Theory of Dramatic Illusion,\" PMLA, LXIX (Dec. 1954), 1150-59.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Neo-Classical Theory and Imagination**\n\nUsing the text, explain how the neo-classical theory of dramatic unities (time, place, action) conflicts with the argument that imagination can transport audiences across space and time.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key claim of neo-classical theory about ''literal delusion'' and its requirement for audience compliance.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast this with the eighteenth-century counterargument that imagination is not bound by reason, but can ''hop'' between places and condense time.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the text suggests that the playwright''s responsibility is to ''not encumber himself with the unities,'' even though they might prevent a playwright from being ''a bad'' one.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of ''reasonableness'' and ''imagination,'' and demonstrate understanding of the theoretical shift from neo-classical to eighteenth-century views on dramatic illusion.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Literary Theory to Practice**\n\nDr. Johnson''s reluctance to read King Lear is mentioned in the text as a reflection of his theoretical stance on dramatic illusion. Using the text,\n- **Part A**: Explain how Johnson''s view that ''the spectator is not literally deluded'' relates to his refusal to read the play.\n- **Part B**: Construct a hypothetical scenario where a playwright, influenced by Johnson''s theory, might choose to ignore the unities. Describe how this choice would affect audience experience and compare it with a play that strictly follows the unities.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate whether Johnson''s position is more ''pragmatic'' or ''theoretical,'' and explain your reasoning based on the text''s discussion of ''reasonableness'' vs. ''imagination.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference Dr. Johnson''s theory and the text''s argument about the limitations of ''reason'' in defining dramatic illusion.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Dramatic Illusion**\n\nThe text presents a debate between the neo-classical view of ''literal delusion'' and the eighteenth-century argument that imagination transcends reason.\n- **Part A**: Determine whether the text supports the idea that ''dramatic illusion'' is a matter of ''reason'' or ''imagination,'' and justify your conclusion using the text''s discussion of Dr. Johnson and the counterargument.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument that demonstrates why the eighteenth-century view is more aligned with ''what the imagination can do'' rather than ''what reason says is reasonable.'' Use the text''s examples of time and place to support your reasoning.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the text''s statement that ''the playwright should not encumber himself with the unities.'' Explain why this advice might be seen as a shift from classical to modern views of dramatic form and performance.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s philosophical debate on dramatic illusion and demonstrate an understanding of the shift from neo-classical to modern theories.'

    Because of the audience for which this article was written—mainly teachers of English on the university level—this summary of previous doctrines can be more abbreviated than it could be if the article were directed to a lay audience. This summary does not so much inform the audience as remind it.

    As in this example from a scholarly article, we often will have occasion to present a summary of what others have thought or said on the theme we are going to develop in our composition. Closely allied to this kind of summary of relevant views advanced by others is the summary of views that we are going to support or refute in our essay. In the following example, Norman Podhoretz summarizes the main theses from Hannah Arendt's book Eichmann in Jerusalem that he is going to take issue with in his article. The final sentence of Mr. Podhoretz's introduction, which provides a transition to this statement of fact, read, "The point to begin with, then, is Miss Arendt's thesis, and the problem to settle is whether it justifies the distortions of perspective it creates and the cavalier treatment of evidence it impels." Then—

    According to Miss Arendt, the Nazis, in order to carry out their genocidal plan against the Jews, needed Jewish cooperation and in fact received it "to a truly extraordinary degree." This cooperation took the form of "administrative and police work," and it was extended by "the highly assimilated Jewish communities of Central and Western Europe" no less abundantly than by "the Yiddish-speaking masses of the East."
    In Amsterdam as in Warsaw, in Berlin as in Budapest, Miss Arendt writes,

    penses of their deportation and extermination, to keep track of vacated
    apartments, to supply police forces to help seize Jews and get them on
    trains, until, as a last gesture, they handed over the assets of the Jewish
    community in good order for final confiscation.
    All this has long been known. What is new is Miss Arendt's assertion
    that if the Jews (or rather, their leaders) had not cooperated in this
    fashion, "there would have been chaos and plenty of misery but the total
    number of victims would hardly have been between four and a half to
    six million people."

    So much for the Jews. As for the Nazis, carrying out the policy of
    genocide required neither that they be monsters nor pathological Jew-
    haters. On the contrary: since the murder of Jews was dictated by the
    law of the state, and since selfless loyalty to the law was regarded by the
    Germans under Hitler as the highest of virtues, it even called for a cer-
    tain idealism to do what Eichmann and his cohorts did. Miss Arendt in
    this connection quotes the famous remark attributed to Himmler: "To
    have stuck it out and, apart from exceptions caused by human weakness,
    to have remained decent, that is what has made us hard." Eichmann,

    then, was telling the truth when he denied having been an anti-Semite:
    he did his duty to the best of his ability, and he would have performed
    with equal zeal even if he had loved the Jews. Thus, also, the Israeli
    prosecutor Gideon Hausner was absurdly off the point in portraying
    Eichmann as a brute and a sadist and a fiend: Eichmann was in actual
    fact a banal personality, a nonentity whose evil deeds flowed not from
    anything in his own character, but rather from his position in the Nazi
    system.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Historical and Ethical Analysis**\n\nBased on the text, explain how Eichmann''s actions can be understood within both a legal and moral framework.\n- **Step 1**: Reference the text''s assertion that Nazi policy was ''dictated by the law of the state.'' Explain how this legal framework influenced Eichmann''s behavior.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast this with Miss Arendt''s argument that non-cooperation would have resulted in ''chaos and plenty of misery.'' Use this to analyze the ethical implications of following state law versus individual conscience.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a reasoned evaluation of whether Eichmann''s actions can be considered ''evil'' or merely the result of systemic complicity.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s themes of law, duty, and morality to provide a comprehensive analysis.'

    This system is, of course, known as totalitarianism, and it is totalitarianism that brings the two halves of Miss Arendt's thesis together. Long ago, David Rousset, Bruno Bettelheim, and Miss Arendt herself taught us that securing the complicity of the victim is one of the distinguishing ambitions of totalitarian states, and her tale of Jewish complicity here is offered (at least on the surface) as yet another illustration of this point. Long ago, too, she and her colleagues taught us that totalitarian states aim at the destruction of common-sense reality and the creation of a new reality moulded to the lineaments of the official ideology, and her conception of Eichmann as an ordinary man whose conscience was made to function "the other way around" is similarly set forth in illustration of the more general point. Obviously, though, this ordinary man could not have been turned into so great and devoted a perpetrator of evil if the system had not been so tightly closed—if, that is to say, there had been voices to protest or gestures of resistance. Such voices as existed, however, were in Miss Arendt's judgment pathetically small and thin, and such gestures of resistance as were displayed she finds relatively insignificant. Not only did "good society everywhere" accept the Final Solution with "zeal and eagerness," but the Jews themselves acquiesced and even cooperated—as we have seen—"to a truly extraordinary degree." Here, then, is the finishing touch to Miss Arendt's reading of the Final Solution, and the explanation she gives for dwelling on Jewish complicity: this chapter of the story, she says, "offers the most striking insight into the totality of the moral collapse the Nazis caused in respect to respectable European society—not only in Germany but in almost all countries, not only among the persecutors but also among the victims."

    The passage just quoted may strike the student as being an inordinately long statement of fact. But it is not really long when viewed in relation to the entire article, which covers eight double-column pages in the magazine. We quoted a fairly long passage to show what proportion a statement of fact might take in an extended discourse. In a shorter article, of course, the statement of fact, if one was needed, would have to be considerably condensed. As always, the importance and complexity of the subject matter and the depth of treatment we choose to give it will also dictate the proper length of the statement of fact. If Mr. Podhoretz had been writing a mere review of Miss Arendt's book he could not have given as much space as he does here to the narrative.

    Quintilian advises that the instruction of the audience in the statement of fact be lucid, brief, and plausible. These three qualities are, of course, relative to the speech situation. An exposition that is lucid and plausible for one audience might not be either for another. Therefore, as in our discussion of the strategies of the introduction, we can lay down no hard-and-fast rules about the management of the statement of fact. We must adapt our means to the ad hoc situation. All we can do here is point to some of the ways that might be used to achieve the qualities that Quintilian mentions, and trust to the student to choose those ways which will best fit the situation in which he finds himself.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Strategies in Statement of Fact**\n\nIn a speech about the importance of education, you are tasked with stating a fact that is both lucid and plausible for your audience.\n- **Step 1**: Choose a fact related to education that is relevant to your audience''s interests.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how you would ensure the fact is lucid (clear and easy to understand) by using simple language and avoiding jargon.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how the fact is plausible (believable and relevant) to your audience''s perspective.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how the qualities of lucidity and plausibility can be adapted to different speech situations, as discussed in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Quintilian''s Principles to Rhetorical Statements**\n\nUsing the principles from the text, evaluate the following statement as a statement of fact: \"The average student in the United States spends 3 hours per day on homework.\"\n- **Part A**: Determine whether this statement is lucid, brief, and plausible based on the text''s description of these qualities.\n- **Part B**: Propose one modification to make the statement more effective for a different audience (e.g., parents, educators).\n- **Part C**: Explain how the text''s emphasis on adapting to the ''ad hoc situation'' applies to your modification.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate Quintilian''s advice with the concept of adapting statements to different audiences.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Rhetorical Structure**\n\nThe text discusses the flexibility of a statement of fact in rhetorical contexts. Consider the following scenario: You are preparing a speech for a group of high school students about the importance of reading.\n- **Part A**: Identify two different ways to present a fact about reading that could be lucid and plausible for this audience.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the text''s discussion of ad hoc adaptation would influence your choice of which fact to present.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterargument against the claim that all statements of fact must be brief and concise. Use examples from the text to support your argument.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of rhetorical adaptability and the nuances of statement of fact in different contexts.'

    Lucidity is largely a matter of style, a matter of so selecting and arranging
    words that we easily communicate our meaning to our audience. We will
    delay our discussion of this means of securing lucidity until the next chapter,
    on style. Lucidity, of course, should characterize all parts of the discourse.
    Here we will mention only those means of securing lucidity peculiar to the
    statement of fact. We will be clear if, first of all, we develop our exposition
    sufficiently to set forth all the facts that need to be known. A severe abridge-
    ment of the exposition could result in obscurity. On the other hand, an ex-
    cessive elaboration could so clutter up the exposition that the main points
    are obscured. An orderly presentation of the facts will also aid lucidity.
    Sometimes chronological order will be the organizing principle of our expo-
    sition—first this happened, then this, then this, etc. At other times we will
    employ an order that moves from the general to the particular or from the
    more familiar to the less familiar.

    Another aid to lucidity is the device that the Greeks called enargeia and
    that we may translate as palpability or vividness. Enargeia will be especially
    useful when our statement of fact lends itself more to a narrative treatment
    than to an expository treatment—as, for instance, in a recital of past events.
    Here if we can paint a word-picture of the scene instead of merely telling
    what happened we can produce that vividness—not to mention the emotional
    impact—which will etch the "facts" in the imaginations of our readers. One
    can imagine a prosecuting lawyer describing Raskolnikov's crime in words
    like these:

    He pulled the axe quite out, swung it with both arms, scarcely conscious
    of himself, and almost without effort, almost mechanically, brought the
    blunt side down on her head....The old woman was as always bare-
    headed. Her thin, light hair, streaked with grey, thickly smeared with
    grease, was plaited in a rat's tail and fastened by a broken horn comb

    which stood out on the nape of her neck. As she was so short, the blow
    fell on the very top of her skull. She cried out, but very faintly, and sud-
    denly sank all of a heap on the floor, raising her hands to her head.

    From Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment, Part I, Chapter 7, trans-
    lated by Constance Garnett.

    In Dostoyevsky's novel, this vivid narrative is not part of a prosecuting law-
    yer's representation in a courtroom, but such a description could be, and often
    has been, the manner in which a lawyer manages the statement of fact in a
    case. There is no doubt about the clarity and effectiveness of such a presenta-
    tion. And while exargeia can be employed in other parts of a discourse, it
    most often finds its opportunity in the statement of fact.

    Before we leave the subject of lucidity, we should make the point that
    clarity of statement does not always serve our purpose. There may be occa-
    sions when it is expedient for us deliberately to obfuscate the exposition. If
    the facts tell against us, it might be best at this point to omit the statement
    of fact altogether or to render our exposition ambiguous. It might be that a
    frank, lucid recital of the facts would so alienate our audience that they
    would become indisposed to listen to our proofs later on. The particular situ-
    ation will dictate when it is prudent to adopt the strategy of omission or
    obfuscation.

    Brevity of statement, as we remarked in our comments on the passage quoted from Norman Podhoretz's article, will also be determined by the particular situation. Aristotle scoffed at the prescription that the statement of fact be brief. He asked why the statement of fact had to be short or long. Why couldn't it be just right? In this characteristic insistence on the via media, Aristotle is calling for the length that is appropriate to the needs of the moment. The principle of "just enough" is the only general prescript that has validity here. We will achieve this due brevity if (1) we start our recital at a point where it begins to concern our readers (comparable to Horace's precept that we begin a story im medias res instead of ab ovo); (2) we exclude all irrelevancies; (3) we excise anything, however relevant, which contributes little or nothing to our readers' understanding of our case or to their friendly disposition toward our cause.

    The plausibility of the statement of fact will result partly from the ethical tone of the discourse itself or from the ethical image of the writer. Readers will believe that the situation is as it has been described if they trust the authority or the character of the writer. The ethical appeal, of course, is important in all parts of the discourse, but we must not minimize its importance in this part of the discourse, which is concerned with a bare recital of the facts.

    Confirmation 205

    We can further enhance the credibility of our statement of fact by being careful not to say anything contrary to nature or to historical fact, by assigning believable causes or reasons for events, by trusting more to understatement than to hyperbole. An audience is amazingly quick to detect that a writer "doth protest too much." If we alienate the credence of our readers at this stage of the discourse, we jeopardize our chances of holding them when we come to the all-important stage of proof.

- prompt: "The use of the term confirmation to label this part may suggest that this  \ndivision figures only in persuasive discourse. But if we regard confirmation  \nor proof as the designation of that part where we get down to the main busi-  \nness of our discourse, this term can be extended to cover expository as well  \nas argumentative prose. The previously discussed parts, the introduction and  \nthe statement of fact, certainly figure in both expository and argumentative  \ndiscourse. If these two parts are regarded as the preliminaries, confirmation  \nthen may be regarded as the core, the central part, the main body, of our  \ndiscourse—the part in which we do what we set out to do, whether that be  \nto explain or to persuade. A good deal of what we say about confirmation is,  \nof course, applicable only to argumentative discourse, but many of the pre-  \ncepts concerning this part of the discourse are equally applicable to expository  \nprose. When we are talking about confirmation in the narrow sense of dem-  \nonstrating or refuting an argument, this will be readily apparent to the  \nstudent.\n\nBecause of the difficulty of illustrating the disposition of arguments by  \nquoting short passages, such as we used in illustrating the previous two parts,  \nwe shall postpone exemplifying the points made until we come to consider  \nwhole essays in the readings at the end of this chapter.\n\nIt is in this part of the discourse principally that we use the material we  \nhave gathered in the process of invention. We must select and dispose this  \nmaterial for maximum effectiveness. The processes of invention and disposi-  \ntion are not really as independent of one another as we may have suggested  \nby giving them separate treatments. In reading, the activity of evaluation  \ncan take place almost simultaneously with the activity of comprehension.  \nLikewise, in composing, we are often engaged with the problems of select-  \ning and arranging our material even while we are engaged in discovering  \nour material. We have discussed invention and disposition separately partly  \nbecause there is a sense in which we must discover before we can arrange\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

    One of the main problems we face in this part of the discourse is the problem of sequence. What point do we take up first? Once we have dealt with that point, then what point do we take up? In expository discourse, we can sometimes organize our material according to a chronological scheme—as, for instance, in an explanation of a relatively simple process, like changing a tire. In the exposition of a more complicated subject, we may have to move from the general to the particular or from the familiar to the unknown. Usually the nature of the thing to be explained will suggest the appropriate procedure.

    In argumentative discourse, however, these organizing principles cannot always be relied on, for we are faced with questions like these: should I begin with my weakest arguments and build up to my strongest arguments? Should I refute the opposing arguments first and then present my arguments, or should I establish my case first and then refute the opposition? As usual, the particular situation will dictate the appropriate strategy, and perhaps all that can be done here is to lay down some guidelines for the student.

    As a general rule, in presenting our own arguments we should not descend from our strongest arguments to our weakest. More often than not, such an anticlimactic order will considerably weaken the effectiveness of our persuasive efforts. We want to leave our strongest argument ringing in the memory of our audience; hence we usually place it in the emphatic final position. If we present our strongest arguments first and then add a series of weaker arguments, we will diminish the effectiveness of the strong ones. The audience may get the impression that our case, solid at first sight, is beginning to unravel. The weaker arguments will strike the audience as being so many "after-thoughts." This suggests that the writer does not really have confidence in the cogency of his strong arguments, that he feels the need for adding some props. If he thus betrays a lack of confidence, he will dispel the confidence of his readers.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Expository Organization Principles**\n\nIn the text, it is suggested that expository discourse can be organized chronologically or from general to particular. Consider the process of ''how to bake a cake'' as an example of chronological organization.\n- **Step 1**: Explain why a chronological structure is appropriate for this task, referencing the text''s discussion of simple processes.\n- **Step 2**: Compare and contrast this with a ''from general to particular'' approach, using the example of explaining the theory of gravity. Justify which method is more suitable and why, based on the text''s suggestion that complexity requires moving from familiar to unknown.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a hybrid approach for explaining a complex process, such as ''how to build a computer'', and explain how it integrates both methods.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate specific examples from the text and demonstrate an understanding of when each organizational principle is most effective.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Argumentative Structure and Persuasion**\n\nThe text argues that in persuasive writing, the strongest arguments should be placed at the end to maximize impact. Consider an argumentative essay on ''The importance of education.''\n- **Part A**: Outline a possible structure for the essay, placing your strongest argument (e.g., ''Education fosters critical thinking'') at the conclusion.\n- **Part B**: Explain why this structure is more effective than starting with your weakest arguments, using the text''s reasoning about ''anticlimactic order'' weakening persuasion.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterargument to the text''s claim, suggesting an alternative structure (e.g., starting with a surprising fact) and justify why it might be effective in certain contexts.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must critically engage with the text''s recommendations while demonstrating an understanding of persuasive strategies.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning in Discourse Organization**\n\nThe text discusses the challenge of sequence in discourse and suggests that the nature of the subject determines the appropriate organizational strategy. Consider the task of explaining ''the history of a scientific discovery.''\n- **Part A**: Identify two possible organizational approaches (e.g., chronological, cause-effect) and explain why each might be appropriate for different aspects of the history.\n- **Part B**: Using the text''s discussion about ''from familiar to unknown,'' create a scenario where a complex topic is presented in a way that builds from the audience''s existing knowledge.\n- **Part C**: Propose a scenario where the text''s advice about ''anticlimactic order'' would be counterproductive, and explain why the structure you propose is more effective.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate specific examples from the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of how discourse organization impacts persuasion and clarity.'

Nevertheless, there usually is implicit in the issue  \nwe are discussing an opposing view that we must meet and dispose of. In  \nsuch cases, it is not enough to establish our own case.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Strategic Sequence of Arguments in Refutation**\n\nIn a public debate, you must present arguments that confirm your case while also refuting opposing views. Based on the text''s advice, design a logical sequence for an argumentative speech:\n- **Part A**: Start with a strong, familiar argument to condition the audience.\n- **Part B**: Introduce one or more weaker arguments that may seem to challenge your position.\n- **Part C**: Conclude with the strongest argument, which surprises the audience and reinforces your main point.\n\n**Task**: Explain why this sequence is effective, referencing the text''s principles of argumentation and refutation.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly apply the text''s advice on strategic sequencing and establish why this structure enhances说服力 (persuasiveness).'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Refutation in Writing: Anticipating Objections**\n\nYou are writing an argumentative essay on a controversial topic. According to the text, you must anticipate and address opposing views even if there is no direct opponent.\n- **Part A**: Identify three potential objections to your thesis that could reasonably arise from readers.\n- **Part B**: For each objection, construct a rebuttal using logical reasoning, referencing the text''s advice on refuting arguments.\n- **Part C**: Explain how this preemptive refutation strengthens your argument, citing the text''s statement about "doubts will remain in the minds of our readers."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s emphasis on anticipating and addressing opposing views in writing. '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Structure of Argumentation**\n\nThe text discusses the importance of arranging arguments in a way that builds credibility and persuasiveness. Using the principles from the text, analyze the following scenario:\n- **Scenario**: A speaker must defend a policy that is unpopular among some segments of the audience.\n- **Part A**: Outline a strategic sequence that begins with strong, familiar arguments and ends with a surprising, strongest argument.\n- **Part B**: Explain how this sequence would counteract the audience''s potential skepticism.\n- **Part C**: Compare this strategy to a direct approach (presenting arguments without refuting opposing views).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s principles of argumentation and demonstrate how strategic sequencing enhances persuasiveness in debate and writing.'

    If the opposing views have been well received by the audience, it is usually
    advisable that we refute those views before we attempt to present our own
    arguments. People who are favorably disposed to the opposite point of view
    will not readily open their minds to our arguments, however valid and cogent
    they may be. The ground must be cleared, as it were, before we can parade
    our support.

    It can never be an inflexible rule, however, that we must first refute the
    Opposing arguments before we present our own. Where the opposing argu-
    ments are relatively weak, we can afford to delay answering them until after
    we have established our own case. In such instances, the cogency of our argu-
    ments will further dispose the audience to recognize the weakness of the
    opposing arguments. And even when the opposing arguments are strong and
    are favorably received by the audience, it will sometimes be expedient to delay
    refuting them. When an audience, for instance, is inordinately hostile to our
    view, the wisest strategy may be to keep the opposing arguments out of sight
    as long as possible. By reminding a hostile audience of opposing arguments
    at the outset, we could so confirm the audience in their prejudices that they
    would not lend an ear to our refutation of those arguments. Under those
    circumstances, presenting our own arguments first might dispose an audi-
    ence at least to listen to our refutation.

    As has been constantly emphasized so far in this chapter, no inflexible rules
    can be laid down dictating what must be done and in what sequence. The
    writer must be prepared to adapt his means to his end and to adjust his
    strategies to fit the particular situation. He must "feel" his way through any
    given situation. Because some writers have a natural sense, or develop a
    sense, for what are the "right" means in any given situation, they often suc-
    ceed where others fail. Unfortunately, rhetoric cannot give rules-of-thumb
    that will cover every situation, but we can briefly review some of the avail-
    able means of refuting opposing views.

    REFUTATION BY APPEAL TO REASON

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Strategic Refutation in Rhetorical Contexts**\n\nConsider a scenario where you are presenting an argument to a group of students who have previously been influenced by opposing views.\n- **Part A**: Explain the reasoning behind delaying refutation of opposing arguments when they are perceived as weak.\n- **Part B**: Justify why, in the case of a hostile audience, it may be more effective to present your own arguments first before addressing opposing ones.\n- **Part C**: Using the text''s emphasis on adaptability, discuss how a writer might adjust their strategy based on audience receptiveness.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion on flexibility and strategic adaptation, with specific references to the conditions under which refutation is delayed or prioritized.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Refutational Strategies**\n\nCompare and contrast two methods of refuting opposing views as described in the text.\n- **Method 1**: Refutation by appeal to reason (as discussed in the text)\n- **Method 2**: Delaying refutation until after presenting your own arguments\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain the core principles of each method.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how these methods might be applied in different rhetorical scenarios (e.g., a hostile audience vs. an audience already sympathetic to the opposing view).\n- **Part C**: Evaluate which method is more effective in a situation where the opposing arguments are strong but the audience is evenly divided.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s discussion on adaptability and strategic flexibility in refutational tactics.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Rhetorical Strategies**\n\nThe text emphasizes that no inflexible rules dictate the sequence of refutation and argumentation. Consider a situation where you are addressing an audience that is initially neutral but has been exposed to both your arguments and opposing views.\n- **Part A**: Propose a sequence of argumentation that would most effectively persuade this audience.\n- **Part B**: Justify why this sequence is more effective than a direct refutation approach.\n- **Part C**: Using the text''s discussion on adapting strategies, explain how a writer might adjust their approach based on feedback during the presentation.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s emphasis on flexibility and the strategic use of refutation in different situations.'

- prompt: "There are two general ways in which we can refute a proposition: we can  \nprove the contradictory of that proposition; we can demolish the arguments  \nby which the proposition is supported. As we saw in the previous chapter, if  \nwe prove that one of a pair of contradictory propositions is true, we automati-  \ncally prove that the other proposition is false. Proving a contradictory propo-  \nsition can be the most compelling kind of refutation, since all men, because  \nof their rational nature, readily recognize the principle that a thing cannot  \nat the same time be and not be.\n\nWe are not always presented, however, with the convenience of contra-  \ndictorily opposed arguments. More often we are faced with the challenge of  \nrefuting contrary propositions. One side maintains that a certain course of  \naction is wise, and the other side maintains that it is foolish. In that case, we  \nmust knock out the props supporting the contrary assertion. We can do this  \n(1) by denying the truth of one of the premises on which the argument rests  \nand proving, perhaps through evidence or testimony, that the premise is  \nfalse, or (2) by objecting to the inferences drawn from the premises. In re-  \njecting the inferences, we say such things as, \"I admit the principle, but |  \ndeny that it leads to such a consequence\" or \"I admit the principle but I deny  \nthat it applies in this case\" or \"Your assertion is true, but it has no force as  \nan argument to support your conclusion.\"\n\nThese are ways of refuting arguments logically, but sometimes we have  \nto deal with probabilities, which cannot be demolished by means of strict  \nlogic. In that case, we must draw on those enthymemes and examples which,  \nif they do not refute the opposition conclusively, do have persuasive valuc.  \nThe emotional and ethical appeals, which we discussed in the previous chap)  \nter, will play their part in refutation too.\n\nREFUTATION 299\n\nREFUTATION BY EMOTIONAL APPEALS\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

    Knowledge of one's audience is perhaps nowhere more important than when
    one is using emotional appeals. A miscalculation about the temper of one's
    audience could destroy or reverse the intended effect. The wrong emotional
    appeal or an emotional appeal applied at an inappropriate place in the dis-
    course or a disproportionate emotional appeal could not only render our
    refutation ineffectual but also diminish confidence in our previously estab-
    lished proof.

    It should be obvious that emotional appeals will succeed better with some
    audiences than with others. One's problems with emotional appeals will in-
    crease in proportion to the heterogeneity of the audience. One can appreciate
    Senator Richard Nixon's dilemma in 1952 when he had to make decisions
    about the kind and degree of emotional appeal to employ in his address to a
    nationwide television audience in defense of his handling of campaign funds.
    Judging from the response to his speech, one would have to conclude that
    Mr. Nixon calculated wisely. His references to "the cloth coat" and to the
    "little dog Checkers" totally alienated one segment of the television audience.
    But for the majority of the audience, those references were the emotional
    touches which capped his apologia.

    It would seem that when addressing a large, heterogeneous audience, one
    must estimate which emotional appeals are likely to succeed with the major
    portion of the audience. In other words, we may have to sacrifice the con-
    currence of one part of our audience in order to gain the assent of the major
    portion. The author who writes a piece for the New Republic or Common-
    weal or The National Review has, in many ways, an easier task than the
    author who writes an argumentative piece for Life or the Saturday Evening
    Post, because the writer for magazines of limited circulation can presume
    more political, philosophical, or religious homogeneity in his audience than
    can the writer for the mass-circulation magazines.

    REFUTATION BY ETHICAL APPEAL

    The ethical appeal must pervade all parts of the discourse, but it is nowhere more important than in this part where we are seeking to prove our case or refute the opposition. So important is the ethical appeal in effecting persuasion that Aristotle said "it is more fitting for a good man to display himself as an honest fellow than as a subtle reasoner" (Rhetoric, III, 17). Sometimes when our case is weak, the ethical appeal, exerted either by the image of the writer or by the tone of the discourse, will carry the day. The effectiveness of the ethical appeal where one's case is weak was particularly evident in the speech that General Douglas MacArthur delivered before Congress in 1951 when he returned to this country after being relieved of his command in Korea. Old soldiers do die, but they sometimes achieve a kind of immortality in the minds of the people they have served.

    REFUTATION BY WIT

    The Earl of Shaftesbury once claimed that "ridicule is the test of truth." Shaftesbury was suggesting that if what was alleged to be the truth could survive the onslaught of ridicule it must really be the truth. If Shaftesbury's claim can be accepted at all it must be accepted with reservations. A genuine truth might very well be reduced to absurdity by a witty rhetorician, but it would remain the truth despite its having been discredited in the minds of the audience.

    Jests, sarcasm, and irony can be effective tools for refutation, but they must
    be used with the utmost discretion. The Greek rhetorician Gorgias advised
    that we should "kill our opponent's seriousness with our ridicule and his
    ridicule with our seriousness." Gorgias was shrewd enough to see that many
    times we cannot counteract the opposition by employing similar tactics. And
    since it is often difficult to "top" a display of wit, we might do well to avoid
    matching humorous sallies with our opponent and to adopt a becoming
    seriousness. On the other hand, we can sometimes destroy the effectiveness
    of a soberly presented argument by wittily reducing the argument to ab-
    surdity. The student must be cautioned however; he risks the dissipation of
    his ethical appeal if his wit is merely a cloak for weak or specious arguments.
    Witty but empty retorts can fool some of the people some of the time, but
    the man who is scrupulous about his tactics will not sacrifice integrity for
    success. The student should pay particular attention to the use that Donald
    L. Lloyd and Jacques Barzun make of wit against each other in the readings
    at the end of this chapter.

    A joke can be used simply to disarm an audience or to dispose an audience
    favorably. When a joke is employed for these purposes, it is most often found
    in the introduction, the most obvious place for those devices which are cal-
    culated to ingratiate the speaker or writer with his audience. But the disarm-
    ing kind of joke can sometimes be used in the confirmation also—as, for in-
    stance, when we are about to launch into an argument that we suspect will
    not readily gain acceptance.

    But the joke can also be used for purposes of refutation if it provides some
    kind of analogy to the point we are seeking to discredit. The analogous joke
    can induce an audience to take an objective view of the point being discussed.
    If we can get an audience laughing at a situation somewhat removed from
    REFUTATION 301

    the point being attacked, we will find it easier to make the audience perceive
    the absurdity when we make an application of the analogy.

    With certain audiences, the more sophisticated varieties of humor will succeed best. One of the most effective kinds of sophisticated humor, especially for the purpose of disarming an audience, is the good-humored bantering in which the speaker or writer makes depreciatory remarks about himself. Almost everyone responds favorably to the man who takes himself down a peg or two, mainly because everyone likes to feel that a man, however exalted, is human after all and that he does not exaggerate his own importance or achievements. Although depreciation of others may sometimes backfire on us, belittling of ourselves will never arouse anyone's resentment and rarely undercut anyone's confidence in us.

    The light touch resulting from an urbane finesse with words is another brand of humor that wears well with certain audiences, especially with the educated. As will be seen in the next chapter on style, many of the figures of speech can be used for this kind of beguiling verbal humor. Puns, for instance, have come to be regarded as a low form of humor, but most of the great writers, from Shakespeare to James Thurber, indulged in plays on words (the rhetoricians called it paronomasia) and felt no need to apologize for their verbal acrobatics. Irony is a subtle form of verbal ingenuity, and while irony comes naturally to most people ("My dear, it's a beautiful hat!"), we must exercise great care in using this trope. Because of its subtlety, irony can easily be misunderstood. There are college students even today who misread Swift's ironical Modest Proposal.

    Sarcasm is another mode of humor that requires a master hand, for it can easily go wrong. Sarcasm seems to succeed best when it is directed at an individual; it is risky when it is directed at nationalities, classes, ranks, or vocations. That this should be so is rather curious, for of all modes of satirical wit, sarcasm is the one that most closely borders on uncharitableness. One might think that since the caustic gibe at an individual comes closer to violating the virtue of charity than the gibe at a group of people, personal sarcasm would be most likely to elicit unfavorable reactions in the audience. But human nature is so constituted that it will tolerate, even enjoy, the vituperation of an individual. The same London society that chuckled over Alexander Pope's vitriolic portrait of Lord John Hervey under the guise of "Sporus" would have been angered if his portrait had been directed at the class of aristocratic courtiers that Lord Hervey represented. The psychology behind this perverse pleasure is pointed up by La Rochefoucauld's famous maxim, "In the misfortune of our best friends, we often find something that pleases."

    The rhetoricians are unanimous in their condemnation of ribald jests in formal discourse. The "dirty story" may provoke laughter when told in small, intimate groups, but in a public discourse, it almost invariably offends and alienates a larger audience. Likewise, we usually react unfavorably to a ribald joke when we see it in print. It is difficult to imagine any situation when a ribald jest will serve our purpose. For rhetorical reasons, as well as for moral reasons, we should avoid the use of obscenity and a double entendre in our discourses.

    The type of literature that makes most use, for rhetorical purposes, of the varieties of humor that we have discussed—and of some that we have not discussed, like parody and burlesque—is satire. And it is notable that some of the greatest English satirists, like Ben Jonson, John Dryden, Alexander Pope, and Jonathan Swift, were thoroughly schooled in classical rhetoric. The student will learn his best lessons about the skillful uses of humor for rhetorical purposes from reading the great satirists. And the student will acquire another method of reading and analyzing satiric literature if he will approach such literature as a manifestation of the kind of rhetoric we have been studying in this book.

    Quintilian once said (Instit. Orat., VI, ii, 26) that "there are no jests so insipid as those which parade the fact that they are intended to be witty." We might very well take these words as a general caution about the use of humor for rhetorical purposes. Humor that merely calls attention to our desire to be "funny" or to be "one of the boys" will alienate more people than it will win. Humor is an extremely difficult art, and if the student does not have a natural gift or an acquired skill for humor, he would do best to avoid the use of this available means of persuasion. And he must also remember that there are many occasions when humor of any kind is wholly inappropriate. We round back finally to that cardinal principle of rhetoric: the subject, the occasion, the audience, and the personality of the speaker or writer will dictate the means we should employ to effect our purpose.

    Conclusion

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Satire and Rhetorical Humor**\n\nThe text argues that satire is the most significant use of humor in rhetorical purposes. Given this, analyze how Ben Jonson and Alexander Pope would approach the use of humor in their satirical works.\n- **Step 1**: Reference the text''s statement that "satire makes the most use of various types of humor."\n- **Step 2**: Discuss how Jonson and Pope, as classical rhetoricians, might apply the principles of classical rhetoric to their satire.\n- **Step 3**: Explain why the text emphasizes that humor in rhetoric should be "skillful" and not merely "insipid."\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate specific examples from the text and demonstrate understanding of how satire functions within classical rhetoric.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Principles to Satire**\n\nUsing the text''s caution about insipid humor, create a satirical piece that demonstrates appropriate use of humor for rhetorical purposes.\n- **Part A**: Write a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) that uses humor to critique a modern social issue.\n- **Part B**: Justify how your piece avoids the pitfalls of insipid humor by applying the text''s principles (e.g., skillful use, audience consideration).\n- **Part C**: Draw a parallel between your satirical piece and the works of Jonathan Swift or Alexander Pope, explaining how they similarly use humor to achieve rhetorical effect.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s warnings and examples, with a well-reasoned connection to classical rhetoric.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Rhetorical Humor and Appropriateness**\n\nThe text states that humor in rhetoric must be appropriate to the subject, occasion, audience, and speaker. Consider a situation where a teacher uses humor in a classroom setting.\n- **Part A**: Identify which of the four factors (subject, occasion, audience, speaker) would most influence the appropriateness of the humor.\n- **Part B**: Create a hypothetical scenario where a teacher''s use of humor could be considered inappropriate, and explain why using the text''s principles.\n- **Part C**: Propose a strategy for a student to use humor effectively in an academic setting, referencing the text''s emphasis on skill and purpose.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate all four factors and demonstrate an understanding of how humor functions within classical rhetoric for a modern audience.'

    A look at the terms that the classical rhetoricians used to designate the con-
    clusion will give us a hint of what the rhetoricians conceived the function
    of this part of a discourse to be. The most common Greek term was epilogos,
    from the verb epilegein, meaning "to say in addition." An even more instruc-
    tive Greek term for this part was anakephalaiosis, which is the equivalent
    of the Latin recapitulatio, from which we have the English "recapitulation."
    The common Latin term for this part was peroratio, a word which in the
    prefix per- suggested "a finishing off" of one's plea. What the Latins meant
    by "finishing off" is suggested by the two heads under which Quintilian
    treated of the peroration—enumeratio (by enumeration or summing-up) and
    affectus (producing the appropriate emotion in the audience).

    While it is obvious that some discourses, because of the nature of the sub-
    ject or situation or because of the limitations of time or allotted wordage,
    can dispense with an elaborate conclusion, the natural tendency for us, when
    we speak or write formally, is to "round off" what we have been molding in
    the earlier parts of the discourse. Without a conclusion, the discourse strikes
    us as merely stopping rather than ending. We are conscious too that because
    the conclusion stands in the final position in the discourse it is the part that
    is "left with" the audience, the part that lingers longest in the memory.
    Accordingly, this is the part where we feel the urge to pull out all the stops,
    where we tend to display the most conspicuous stylistic eloquence and
    emotional intensity. Because of this natural urge to sound the full diapason
    of our stylistic and emotional resources, we sometimes overdo these effects
    and thereby detract from the solid achievements of the earlier parts of the
    discourse. Discretion must be as alive here as it was in the earlier parts.

    Aristotle taught that generally we strive to do four things in the conclusion:

    I. to inspire the audience with a favorable opinion of ourselves and
    an unfavorable opinion of our opponents;

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Conclusion Functions**\n\nBased on the text, explain how the conclusion in a discourse serves both a functional and an emotional purpose. Use examples from the text to illustrate how the conclusion''s role in "rounding off" the discourse relates to its function in leaving a lasting impression on the audience.\n- **Key Points to Address**:\n  1. The functional purpose of the conclusion (e.g., "rounding off", "finishing off") as described by Latin terms like peroratio and recapitulatio.\n  2. The emotional purpose of the conclusion (e.g., "producing the appropriate emotion", "pulling out all the stops") as described by terms like affectus and epilogos.\n  3. The tension between the need for eloquence in the conclusion and the risk of overdoing it, as discussed by Quintilian.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the definitions of peroratio, recapitulatio, and affectus from the text to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the conclusion''s dual role.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Rhetorical Structure and Purpose**\n\nThe text mentions that the conclusion is "the part that is ''left with'' the audience, the part that lingers longest in the memory." Explain how this statement reflects the broader rhetorical principle of "closure" and compare it to the function of an introduction in a discourse. Use specific terms from the text (e.g., "finishing off", "rounding off", "recapitulation") to support your analysis.\n- **Key Points to Address**:\n  1. The concept of closure in rhetoric as defined by the text (e.g., "the part that is left with the audience").\n  2. The role of the introduction in setting up the discourse, and how its function contrasts with that of the conclusion.\n  3. The relationship between closure and the overall structure of a discourse, as described by Quintilian''s treatment of peroration.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reference the text''s discussion of peroratio and its two subparts (enumeratio and affectus) to show a deep understanding of the rhetorical structure.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Rhetorical Conclusions**\n\nThe text warns that overdoing the emotional effects in a conclusion can "detract from the solid achievements of the earlier parts of the discourse." Using examples from the text, explain why this is a rhetorical risk and how a balanced conclusion should reflect both the functional and emotional aspects of the discourse.\n- **Key Points to Address**:\n  1. The risk of overemphasizing affectus (emotion) at the expense of the structural closure provided by enumeratio.\n  2. The importance of discretion in balancing stylistic eloquence with the integrity of the discourse''s earlier parts.\n  3. The relationship between Aristotle''s four purposes in the conclusion and the need for a balanced approach.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the definitions of peroratio, affectus, and enumeratio from the text to demonstrate a comprehensive analysis of the rhetorical risks associated with overdoing the conclusion.'

The student  \nwill note, for instance, how short the conclusion is to Macaulay's speech  \nreproduced among the readings at the end of this chapter. The advice here,  \nis in other parts of the discourse, is that we should do what needs to be  \ndone, not what convention says must be done.\n\nOf the four things that Aristotle designates, recapitulation is the one that  \nwill most often figure in the conclusion. Normally when we come to the  \nend of a discourse, we all feel the need to restate in general terms the points  \nwe have set forth in detail in the body of the discourse. This inclination is  \nprompted perhaps by our feeling that we must refresh the memory of our  \naudience. Then too there is the awareness that facts and arguments the force  \nof which was blunted by details will gain in effect when set forth in capsule  \nform at the end of the discourse.\n\nSometimes an author will explicitly signal that he is about to recapitulate  \nthe points he has made in the body of the essay. Here is an example of a  \nformally announced recapitulation, together with the author's declaration  \nof his reasons for the recapitulation, from the concluding paragraphs of an  \narticle, the thesis of which was set forth in the first sentence of the article:  \n\"T maintain that democratic manners—typified by the practice of calling the  \nboss by his first name—have reached the point in our country where they  \nconduce not to the preservation of personal dignity but to the abject sub-  \nmission of one man to another.\"\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

    I have nearly finished. But I know that some fool—most likely, one
    with a Ph.D.—will read this article and forever after assert as a well-
    known fact that I yearn for a restoration of Tsardom, for a reinvigora-
    tion of the Hindu caste system and for a truly Chinese subjugation of
    women and children. So let me recapitulate, in the course of which I
    shall add one or two points that I forgot to mention earlier.

    A sensible system of manners, sensibly formal, performs various serv-
    ices. Besides acting as a constant reminder of some important facts of
    life, it affords human beings the distinctly human satisfaction of symbolic
    expression. Besides making collective living possible, it provides a person,
    thanks to its formalities, with protective armor against collective pres-
    sures. For these formalities allow the individual to acquiesce in the social
    order while reserving his final judgment of it. They enable him to pledge
    his loyalty to men in authority without making those fine adjustments
    whose long-term results are the same as those of brainwashing.

    Democratic manners in America are eating the heart out of American
    democracy. With no impressive way of saluting the system, and the posi-
    tion which a given official occupies in it, one must prostrate himself
    before the man. There is a country where such prostration is even more
    prostrate than in America. There the humblest citizen calls his mighty
    ruler comrade.

    I suggest a prudent reform in American manners, not a revolution. If
    the only alternative to egalitarian manners is a nerveless society exhausted
    by protocol and ceremony, then this discussion is futile. But that is not
    the only alternative, except in the minds of latter-day Jacobins for whom
    the stratifications of the ancien régime are more real than the proletar-
    ianizations of their own time. There are in-between solutions, attuned to
    reality, however they resist simple and consistent formulation, as the Eng-
    lish know, and as America, in her own fashion, can discover. Pedantic
    democrats presume to speak for wisdom, creative ability and service, as
    against mere money in the bank. But without a rectification of manners
    most men would rather achieve a Cadillac than such virtues, for these

    To realize the value of such a recapitulation, the student would have to study
    this passage in conjunction with the body of the article, where the author
    developed his points at some length. And whereas the author here explicitly
    informs his readers that he is going to recapitulate the points he has made in
    the article and tells them why he feels the need to do so, most of the time,
    writers slip into recapitulation without explicitly alerting the reader. Most
    of the time it is fairly obvious that the author is summarizing his points.

    How important recapitulation can be is nowhere more dramatically dem-
    onstrated than in a court trial. The jury has spent days, sometimes weeks,
    listening to highly detailed testimony and cross-examination. Surely at the
    end of this period, the jury has all the material it needs to render a verdict.
    But, as anyone knows who has witnessed a real or a fictional trial, both
    the prosecuting and defending attorneys present a summary of their cases
    before the jury is sent out to deliberate its verdict. The prosecutor and de-
    fender spend most of their time in this summary reminding the jury of the
    main points established during the course of the trial. Not only are the
    issues and arguments sharpened by these summaries, but coming one upon
    the other in rapid succession, they gain a cumulative force.

    Let us view a fictional example of such a summary. Because this summary
    is tightly controlled by the novelist, it is probably less rambling than the
    summaries lawyers present in actual trials. In this scene from the novel
    To Kill a Mockingbird, Atticus, the lawyer defending a Negro falsely accused
    of raping a white girl, is making his final plea to the jury:

    "Gentlemen," he was saying, "I shall be brief, but I would like to use
    my remaining time with you to remind you that this case is not a difficult one, it requires no minute sifting of complicated facts, but it does
    require you to be sure beyond all reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the
    defendant. To begin with, this case should never have come to trial. This
    case is as simple as black and white.

    "The state has not produced one iota of medical evidence to the effect
    that the crime Tom Robinson is charged with ever took place. It has
    relied instead upon the testimony of two witnesses whose evidence has
    not only been called into serious question on cross-examination, but has
    been flatly contradicted by the defendant. The defendant is not guilty,

    "I have nothing but pity in my heart for the chief witness for the state,
    but my pity does not extend so far as to her putting a man's life at stake,
    which she has done in an effort to get rid of her own guilt.

    "I say guilt, gentlemen, because it was guilt that motivated her. She
    has committed no crime, she has merely broken a rigid and time-honored
    code of our society, a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded
    from our midst as unfit to live with. She is the victim of cruel poverty
    and ignorance, but I cannot pity her: she is white. She knew full well
    the enormity of her offense, but because her desires were stronger than
    the code she was breaking, she persisted in breaking it. She persisted,
    and her subsequent reaction is something that all of us have known at
    one time or another. She did something every child has done—she tried
    to put the evidence of her offense away from her. But in this case she was
    no child hiding stolen contraband: she struck out at her victim—of necessity she must put him away from her—he must be removed from her
    presence, from this world. She must destroy the evidence of her offense."

    "What was the evidence of her offense? Tom Robinson, a human being. She must put Tom Robinson away from her. Tom Robinson was her daily reminder of what she did. What did she do? She tempted a Negro.

    "She was white, and she tempted a Negro. She did something that in our society is unspeakable: she kissed a black man. Not an old Uncle, but a strong young Negro man. No code mattered to her before she broke it, but it came crashing down on her afterwards.

    "Her father saw it, and the defendant has testified as to his remarks. What did her father do? We don't know, but there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that Mayella Ewell was beaten savagely by someone who led almost exclusively with his left. We do know in part what Mr. Ewell did: he did what any God-fearing, persevering, respectable white man would do under the circumstances—he swore out a warrant, no doubt signing it with his left hand, and Tom Robinson now sits before you, having taken the oath with the only good hand he possesses—his right hand.

    "And so a quiet, respectable, humble Negro who had the unmitigated temerity to ‘feel sorry' for a white woman has had to put his worth against two white people's. I need not remind you of their appearance and conduct on the stand—you saw them for yourselves. The witnesses for the state, with the exception of the sheriff of Maycomb County, have presented themselves to you gentlemen, to this court, in the cynical confidence that their testimony would not be doubted, confident that you gentlemen would go along with them on the assumption—the evil assumption—that all Negroes lie, that all Negroes are basically immoral beings, that all Negro men are not to be trusted around our women, an assumption one associates with minds of their caliber.

    Atticus goes on for three more paragraphs, appealing to the theme of equal
    justice for all in the courts. Anyone who has read To Kill a Mockingbird or
    has seen the movie based on the novel remembers how skillfully Atticus
    Finch had argued the points he is summarizing here and how necessary it
    was for him, considering the kind of jurymen he had to deal with, to remind
    the jury of the arguments in the case and to put the trial in its proper per-
    spective. A summation like this does more, however, than merely remind
    the
    audience of the salient points; it continues and reinforces the persuasion
    which is the main object of the speech. So while Atticus's recapitulation is
    largely expository, it is argumentative, right down to the final period.

    Closely allied to the kind of conclusion that recapitulates or summarizes,
    is the one that generalizes. This is the kind of conclusion that broadens and
    extends the view of the problem or issue that we have been considering in
    the body of the discourse, that considers the ultimate consequences of the
    views we have been arguing or refuting, that recommends an attitude to
    adopt or a course of action to follow. To put it another way, this is the kind
    of conclusion that presents the general conclusions we have arrived at as a
    result of considering our subject.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Atticus''s Argument and Rhetorical Conclusions**\n\nAtticus Finch''s summation in *To Kill a Mockingbird* is both expository and argumentative. In the text, it is stated that a conclusion can be either a recapitulation or a generalization.\n- **Part A**: Explain how Atticus''s conclusion in the trial serves as a recapitulation. Use specific details from the text to justify your answer.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the two types of conclusions (recapitulation vs. generalization) as described in the text. How does Atticus''s approach reflect these two types of reasoning?\n- **Part C**: Based on the text, describe how a conclusion that generalizes differs from one that recapitulates. Provide an example of a real-world scenario where the latter might be more appropriate than the former.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both the text''s analysis of rhetorical conclusions and Atticus''s specific argument in *To Kill a Mockingbird*.'

"Equal justice for all is a fundamental principle of democracy."\n- **Part A**: Identify which type of conclusion each statement represents (recapitulation or generalization). Justify your answer using the text''s definitions.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument that combines both types of conclusions. Start with a specific instance (like the trial), then move to a broader generalization, and conclude with a recapitulation that reinforces the initial point.\n- **Part C**: Explain why the ability to distinguish between recapitulation and generalization is crucial in persuasive writing, using examples from both the text and your own reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the two types of conclusions and their roles in persuasive discourse, as outlined in the text.'

    It is in the summarizing kind of conclusion that we have the best opportunity to engage in what the rhetoricians called amplification and extenuation.
    Amplification is the process by which we highlight, by which we make as
    "big as possible," the points we have made; amplification is a way of remind-
    ing audiences of the importance or cogency or superiority of our points.
    Extenuation does just the opposite: it insists that the points made by the
    opposition are insignificant, weak, or inferior. The common topics that we
    most resort to when we are seeking to amplify our own points or to mini-
    mize our opponent's points are the topic of size and the topic of degree. In
    other words, we try to emphasize or de-emphasize either the absolute or the
    relative magnitude of the points we have made. Of course we try to do this
    when we are presenting our arguments, but it can be helpful to our cause
    to engage in some amplifying and extenuating in a summary way in the
    conclusion.

    One final caution about the recapitulation; let it be as brief as possible.
    Otherwise the conclusion will take on the proportions of a second discourse,
    and it will serve only to weary and alienate the audience. Nothing so
    exasperates an audience as the speaker or writer who goes "on and on" after
    he has announced that he is about to conclude. A disproportionate conclusion
    is usually more damaging to the effect of an essay than a disproportionate
    introduction. A fresh audience may be disposed to forgive a treadmill intro-
    duction, but a weary audience will invariably resent the interminable con-
    clusion.

    Emotional appeals, as we have seen, are appropriate in any part of the
    discourse. Traditionally, however, the conclusion has been the part in which
    emotional appeals have figured most prominently. Present-day students have

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Amplification and Extenuation in Rhetoric**\n\nIn the context of a conclusion, how can amplification and extenuation be effectively used to reinforce an argument without overstating the case? Use examples from the text to illustrate how emphasizing the ''size'' or ''degree'' of a point can serve both to highlight its importance and to de-emphasize the opposition''s arguments.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text''s discussion on amplification and extenuation, including the examples of ''size'' and ''degree,'' and demonstrate an understanding of how these rhetorical strategies can be applied in a balanced manner to strengthen the conclusion without alienating the audience.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Balancing Conclusion Length in Rhetorical Discourse**\n\nThe text warns against an overly long conclusion, stating that it can be more damaging than an overly long introduction. Using the text''s advice about the ''proportions'' of a conclusion, explain why a balanced approach is essential.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Compare the potential impact of a disproportionate conclusion (e.g., one that is too lengthy) on an eager versus a weary audience.\n- **Part B**: Propose a strategy for structuring the conclusion so that it is as brief as possible while still achieving its purpose of reinforcing the main argument.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reflect an understanding of the text''s cautionary advice and provide a practical strategy rooted in the principles of classical rhetoric.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Strategic Use of Emotional Appeals in Conclusions**\n\nThe text emphasizes that emotional appeals are especially prominent in the conclusion. Using examples from the text, explain how an effective conclusion can utilize emotional appeal to strengthen the argument without overshadowing logical reasoning.\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Describe a scenario where emotional appeal in the conclusion could be both persuasive and logical.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the potential risks of over-reliance on emotional appeal in a conclusion and how to mitigate those risks based on the text''s guidance.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of emotional appeals and demonstrate an understanding of how to balance them with logical arguments in a conclusion.'

    A flamboyant orator like William Jennings Bryan would show them how speakers once indulged the natural urge to pull out all the emotional stops in the peroration. Probably more familiar to modern students, Sir Winston Churchill was an orator in the grand old tradition. An example of the rousing kind of emotional appeal is found in the peroration of Sir Winston Churchill's famous speech to the House of Commons on May 13, 1940:

    I say to the House as I said to Ministers who have joined this government, I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat. We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many months of struggle and suffering.

    You ask, what is our policy? I say it is to wage war by land, sea, and air. War with all our might and with all the strength God has given us, and to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy.

    You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs—victory in spite of all terrors—victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival.

    Let that be realized. No survival for the British Empire, no survival for all that the British Empire has stood for, no survival for the urge, the impulse of the ages, that mankind shall move forward toward his goal.

    I take up my task in buoyancy and hope. I feel sure that our cause will not be suffered to fail among men.

    I feel entitled at this juncture, at this time, to clair the aid of all and to say, "Come then, let us go forward together with our united strength."

    Even today most of us have a nostalgic fondness for this kind of oratory, and occasionally, such as at a nominating convention, we are treated to a display of this rousing brand of oratory. Generally, however, we profess to be suspicious of grandiloquent exploitations of our emotions. And while we have probably misjudged our susceptibility to emotional appeals, it is true that bombastic displays of emotion have largely passed out of fashion.

    Today we are more likely to regard as fitting the temperate kind of emotional appeal that Abraham Lincoln exerted in his "Second Inaugural Address." In this example, a good deal of the emotional appeal is produced by the choice of diction and by the rhythm and structure of the sentences:

    The Almighty has His own purposes. "Woe unto the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh." If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offense came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers
    in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with a sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, "The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."

    With malice towards none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in—to bind up the nation's wounds—to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.

    To note the passing of the bombastic style is not to admit that we have
    ceased to be responsive to emotional appeals or that we have ceased to employ
    emotional appeals. What has happened is that emotional appeals, especially
    as they appear in conclusions, tend to be more subtle and more restrained
    than they were in this country even fifty years ago. We seem to be relying
    less on direct emotional appeals and more on such indirect means as the
    graces of style. The rhythms of our sentences, for instance, exert an influence
    on the emotions that is no less real for being all but unnoticeable. We shall
    consider these emotional effects at greater length in the chapter on style.

    Whether we need to resort to emotional appeals in the conclusion and
    how hard we should come down on the emotional appeals will depend
    largely on the nature of our audience. It is extremely important that the
    speaker or writer gauge, as accurately as possible, the temper of the known
    or probable audience for his discourse. Some audiences will be less susceptible
    to emotional appeals than others. A professional group, for instance, inclined
    by temperament or training to accept or reject a proposal on its proven
    merits, may be impervious, even hostile, to any appeal to their emotions on
    matters of professional interest. An audience's susceptibility to emotional
    appeals could vary, of course, with the subject being discussed. A group of
    doctors, for instance, could be offended by any emotional appeal when they
    were being urged to adopt some new drug or technique; but on a subject
    like government sponsorship of medical insurance, this same group could
    be wide open to emotional appeals. Then too when the available means of
    logical persuasion on a given subject are weak—or at least weaker than those
    of the opposition—we may find it expedient to resort to emotional persuasion.
    Quintilian saw the effectiveness of emotional appeal in such a situation:
    "Proofs, it is true, may induce the judges to regard our case as superior to
    that of our opponent, but the appeal to the emotions will do more, for it will

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Emotional Appeal in Rhetoric**\n\nIn the context of classical rhetoric, evaluate the effectiveness of emotional appeals in a persuasive argument. Consider the following scenarios:\n1. A medical professional arguing for a new treatment protocol to a group of peers\n2. A public speaker advocating for environmental conservation to a broad audience\n\n- **Part A**: Analyze which scenario is more likely to rely on emotional appeals and explain why, based on the text''s discussion of audience susceptibility.\n- **Part B**: Propose a strategy for balancing logical and emotional appeals in each scenario, using the principles from the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s argument about audience receptivity and the strategic use of emotional appeals in different contexts.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Emotional Appeal Strategies**\n\nBased on the text''s discussion of when emotional appeals are most effective, create a hypothetical argument for a policy change.\n- **Part A**: Choose a specific policy (e.g., education reform, healthcare access) and describe the context where emotional appeals would be more effective than logical arguments.\n- **Part B**: Design an argument that combines both logical and emotional appeals, ensuring that the emotional aspect is subtle and restrained as described in the text.\n- **Part C**: Justify why this combination is more persuasive than relying solely on one type of appeal.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must demonstrate a clear understanding of when and how to use emotional appeals effectively, as outlined in the text.'

    make them wish our case to be better. And what they wish, they will also
    believe.'—Instit. Orat. VI, ii, 5. Quintilian went so far as to claim that "it is
    in its power over the emotions that the life and soul of oratory is to be
    found" (VI, ii, 7). The great Latin rhetorician may seem to be encouraging
    the use of any kind of unethical means to accomplish our purpose. But any-
    one who recalls Quintilian's view that the ideal orator is "the good man
    speaking" must reject this imputation. Quintilian is merely giving frank
    recognition to the fact that, men being what they are, emotional appeal
    will in some circumstances be the most effective of the available means of
    persuasion. This recognition is not the same as sanctioning any and all
    exploitations of emotion, for the classical rhetoricians did not regard emo-
    tional appeals as illegitirnate per se. Men sometimes abused this means of
    persuasion, but the fact that some men abused this power did not invalidate
    all uses of this resource.

    The fourth thing we may do, and sometimes feel compelled to do, in the
    conclusion is to dispose the audience favorably toward ourselves. If we have
    not exerted an ethical appeal in the earlier parts of our discourse, it is prob-
    ably too late to try to exert it in the conclusion. We have seen that as early
    as the introduction, we may have to ingratiate ourselves with a hostile audi-
    ence or post our credentials with a skeptical audience, and in later parts of
    the discourse, we may frequently have to bolster the credit we have estab-
    lished with our audience. To delay establishing a favorable image of ourselves
    until the conclusion would usually jeopardize our chances of persuading an
    audience. So when we make an effort in the conclusion to dispose an audi-
    ence favorably toward ourselves, we should be merely renewing and rein-
    forcing the ethical appeal that has been working in earlier parts of the dis-
    course.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Ethical Appeal in Rhetoric**\n\nExplain the distinction between ethical appeal (ethos) and emotional appeal (pathos) as outlined in the text. How does Quintilian''s assertion that ''the ideal orator is "the good man speaking"'' support the importance of ethical appeal in persuasion?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference Quintilian''s quote and demonstrate an understanding of how ethical appeal aligns with the concept of a ''good man speaking'' in rhetorical practice.\n\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Strategic Use of Ethos in Discourse**\n\nDescribe the strategic timing of ethical appeals (ethos) within a rhetorical discourse, as discussed in the text. Why is it important to establish a favorable image of oneself early in the discourse, and what happens if this is delayed until the conclusion?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the concepts of ''ingratiating oneself with a hostile audience'' and ''post[ing] our credentials with a skeptical audience'' from the text.\n\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Ethical vs. Emotional Persuasion**\n\nCompare and contrast the classical rhetoricians'' view of emotional appeals (pathos) with their stance on ethical appeals (ethos). How does the text justify the claim that ''emotional appeals are not illegitimate per se'' but can be abused?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly address the distinction between ''illegitimate per se'' and ''abused'' in relation to emotional appeals, as discussed in the text.'

    The kinds of ethical appeal that seem to be most appropriate in the conclusion are the frank confession of our shortcomings, honest acknowledgment of the strength of the opposing case, and magnanimous gestures toward vindictive opponents. It is well to leave our audience with the impression that we have no illusions about ourselves or our position, that we have a respect for truth wherever we find it, and that we are capable of returning charity for malice. The audience gets the impression that the man capable of making frank confessions and generous concessions is not only a good man but a man so confident of the strength of his position that he can afford to concede points to the opposition.

    We observed in the section on the introduction that if we feel it necessary to arouse hostility against our opponent, it is usually better to do this in the conclusion rather than in the introduction. It is easier, for one thing, to arouse hostility against an opponent after we have demolished his arguments. Circumstances, however, might dictate that it would be better to arouse this hostility early in the discourse. In the reading from the Apology in the previous chapter, we saw that Socrates deemed it necessary to stir up animosity against Meletus quite early in his speech of defense.

    Concluding Remarks on Arrangement

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Ethical Appeal in Conclusion: Confession and Concessions**\n\nThe text emphasizes the importance of ethical appeal in concluding arguments, particularly through frank confession of shortcomings and generous concessions.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the author suggests that a conclusion is a more appropriate place to arouse hostility against an opponent than the introduction. Support your answer with examples from the text (e.g., Socrates'' defense speech).\n- **Part B**: Discuss the ethical implications of a speaker who is "capable of making frank confessions and generous concessions." How does this reflect on the speaker''s character?\n- **Part C**: Imagine a scenario where an argument is presented with both strong points and notable weaknesses. Using the text''s advice, construct a conclusion that balances admission of shortcomings with a firm defense of one''s position.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the text''s emphasis on ethical appeal and demonstrate an understanding of how to structure a conclusion that is both principled and persuasive.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Strategic Use of Hostility in Argumentation**\n\nThe text suggests that while it is generally better to convey hostility in the conclusion, there are circumstances where early hostility might be more effective.\n- **Part A**: Compare and contrast the two approaches (early hostility vs. late hostility) as outlined in the text. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy?\n- **Part B**: Using the example of Socrates'' speech from the Apology, analyze why he chose to introduce hostility early. What does this reveal about his rhetorical strategy?\n- **Part C**: Create a hypothetical argument where early hostility would be appropriate, and explain why this approach is justified based on the text''s reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reflect an understanding of the strategic use of hostility and demonstrate the ability to apply this concept to different argumentative contexts.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Character and Integrity in Rhetoric**\n\nThe text concludes with the idea that a speaker who is able to make frank confessions and generous concessions is not only a good man but one who is confident in his position.\n- **Part A**: Define what it means to be "capable of making frank confessions and generous concessions" according to the text. How does this relate to ethical rhetoric?\n- **Part B**: Argue that a speaker who lacks this quality is not only intellectually dishonest but also ethically compromised. Use examples from the text to support your claim.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s advice influences the way we view the integrity of a speaker in a debate or public argument. How does this contribute to the credibility of the argument?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a deep understanding of the ethical dimensions of rhetoric and show how integrity in speech affects the perception of an argument.'

    In this chapter, we have been reviewing the usual parts of an extensive discourse, noting what is normally done in each of these parts and remarking the adjustments that frequently have to be made to fit the particular situation. Almost no rule about arrangement is inflexible. Anything "bends" to the exigencies of the moment—to the demands, in other words, of the subject, or the kind of discourse, or the personality or ability of the writer, or the temper of the audience. Where so many adjustments may have to be made to the ad hoc situation, very few hard-and-fast precepts can be laid down. Some students succeed better than others in making these strategic adjustments because they have been endowed with sound instincts for what is effective in any given situation. But other students, not so gifted, can through experience and practice and guidance acquire a measure of this skill. Experience and practice the student must gain on his own; this text attempts to supply the general guidance that a student may need.

    All that rhetoric can do is point out that given this subject or this purpose or this audience, this is what the student may have to do in some part of the discourse, and this is how he might do what he has to do. Disposition then becomes something more than the conventional system for organizing a discourse, something more than just a system of outlining the composition; it becomes a discipline that trains the student in the judicious selection and use of available means to the desired end.

    Since so many decisions about arrangement depend upon the given situation, it would be well for the student now to study some readings in order to see how some authors have managed arrangement in their given situation.

    THOMAS BABINGTON MACAULAY: EDUCATION

    The advantage in starting our study of arrangement with a fairly long piece of connected discourse, is that the long piece has more parts, and it is easier to discern how important it is to arrange these many parts in such a way as to achieve maximum unity, coherence, and effectiveness. For our first example, then, we have chosen Thomas Babington Macaulay's speech on the advantages of a state-supported educational system, delivered in the House of Commons on April 19, 1847.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Discourse Arrangement in Rhetoric**\n\nGiven the text''s emphasis on the adaptability of rhetorical arrangement to the ''exigencies of the moment,'' evaluate the discourse structure of Macaulay''s speech on education.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the main purpose of Macaulay''s speech (e.g., to advocate for state-supported education).\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how the structure of the speech accommodates its purpose, considering factors like audience, subject matter, and rhetorical strategy.\n- **Step 3**: Compare the arrangement to the text''s assertion that ''very few hard-and-fast precepts can be laid down.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how Macaulay''s arrangement reflects the flexibility and situational adaptability emphasized in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Disposition**\n\nThe text describes disposition as ''a discipline that trains the student in the judicious selection and use of available means to the desired end.'' Apply this concept to analyze how Macaulay''s speech uses rhetorical strategies to achieve its purpose.\n- **Step 1**: Determine the key rhetorical strategies employed (e.g., appeals to reason, emotion, or credibility).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how these strategies are selected and arranged to align with the speech''s purpose.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how this reflects the text''s view of disposition as a disciplined approach to rhetorical composition.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must explicitly connect the rhetorical techniques used in Macaulay''s speech to the principles of disposition outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Discourse Adaptability**\n\nThe text argues that ''anything bends to the exigencies of the moment.'' Evaluate how Macaulay''s speech demonstrates this adaptability.\n- **Step 1**: Identify specific instances where the structure or content of the speech adapts to its context (e.g., audience, purpose, or situation).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how these adaptations contribute to the speech''s effectiveness.\n- **Step 3**: Reflect on how this aligns with the text''s claim that ''some students succeed better than others in making these strategic adjustments.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your evaluation must demonstrate an understanding of how the speech''s adaptability reflects the broader principles of rhetorical arrangement discussed in the text.'

    A bill was up before the House of Commons in the spring of 1847, asking
    for an appropriation of one hundred thousand pounds to help finance a school
    system for those people who could not afford to send their children to private
    schools. When Lord John Russell moved that the bill be put to a vote of the
    House, Thomas Duncombe, the Member for Finsbury, proposed the follow-
    ing amendment:

    That previous to any grant of public money being assented to by this
    House for the purpose of carrying out the scheme of national education,
    as developed in the Minutes of the Committee of Council on Education
    in August and December last, which minutes have been presented to
    both Houses of Parliament by command of Her Majesty, a select Com-
    mittee be appointed to inquire into the justice and expediency of such a
    scheme and its probable annual cost; also to inquire whether the regula-
    tions attached thereto do not unduly increase the influence of the crown,
    invade the constitutional functions of Parliament, and interfere with the
    religious convictions and civil rights of Her Majesty's subjects.

    As a result of Macaulay's speech in opposition to that proposed amendment
    and of the subsequent debate in the House, the amendment was soundly
    defeated. Somewhat ironically, however, Macaulay was defeated the follow-
    ing July when he stood for re-election for Edinburgh.

    Americans, with their flourishing network of public schools, may find it
    difficult to sympathize with the opposition offered by the Member for Fins-
    bury to a system of subsidized schools, but there are a number of issues raised
    in Macaulay's speech which are still being vigorously debated in America to-
    day—principally the issue of federal vs. state support and control.

Identify at least two specific techniques from the text and explain their effectiveness.\n- **Part B**: How does the text''s description of Macaulay''s speech relate to contemporary debates on federal vs. state control in education?\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the irony noted in the text regarding Macaulay''s defeat. How might this irony be interpreted in modern political contexts?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of rhetorical analysis and its relevance to current political issues.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Historical and Political Concepts**\n\nSynthesize the themes of public education, constitutional authority, and political power as presented in the text.\n- **Part A**: How does the amendment reflect the tension between constitutional functions of Parliament and the proposed national education scheme?\n- **Part B**: What parallels can be drawn between the 1847 debate and modern issues in education funding and policy?\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument for or against the implementation of a national education system, citing at least two points from the text and applying them to a modern context.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate historical analysis with contemporary political reasoning, using the text as a foundation for your argument.'

     defence of myself or of my colleagues. I am surprised, I own, that a man of
    his acuteness and ability should, on such an occasion, have made such a
    speech. The country is excited from one end to the other by a great question
    of principle. On that question the Government has taken one side. The
    honourable Member stands forth as the chosen and trusted champion of a
    great party which takes the other side. We expected to hear from him a full
    exposition of the views of those in whose name he speaks. But, to our
    astonishment, he has scarcely even alluded to the controversy which has
    divided the whole nation. He has entertained us with sarcasms and personal
    anecdotes: he has talked much about matters of mere detail: but I must say
    that, after listening with close attention to all that he has said, I am quite
    unable to discover whether, on the only important point which is in issue,
    he agrees with us or with that large and active body of Nonconformists
    which is diametrically opposed to us. He has sat down without dropping
    one word from which it is possible to discover whether he thinks that educa-
    tion is or that it is not a matter with which the State ought to interfere.
    Yet that is the question about which the whole nation has, during several
    weeks, been writing, reading, speaking, hearing, thinking, petitioning, and
    on which it is now the duty of Parliament to pronounce a decision. That
    question once settled, there will be, I believe, very little room for dispute. If
    it be not competent to the State to interfere with the education of the people,
    the mode of interference recommended by the Committee of Council must
    of course be condemned. If it be the right and the duty of the State to make
    provision for the education of the people, the objections made to our plan
    will, in a very few words, be shown to be frivolous.

    3 I shall take a course very different from that which has been taken by
    the honourable gentleman. I shall in the clearest manner profess my opinion
    on that great question of principle which he has studiously evaded; and for
    my opinion I shall give what seem to me to be unanswerable reasons.

    4 I believe, Sir, that it is the right and the duty of the State to provide
    means of education for the common people. This proposition seems to me to
    be implied in every definition that has ever yet been given of the functions
    of a government. About the extent of those functions there has been much
    difference of opinion among ingenious men. There are some who hold that
    it is the business of a government to meddle with every part of the system
    of human life, to regulate trade by bounties and prohibitions, to regulate
    expenditure by sumptuary laws, to regulate literature by a censorship, to
    regulate religion by an inquisition. Others go to the opposite extreme, and
    assign to Government a very narrow sphere of action. But the very narrow-
    est sphere that ever was assigned to governments by any school of political
    philosophy is quite wide enough for my purpose. On one point all the dis-
    putants are agreed. They unanimously acknowledge that it is the duty of
    every government to take order for giving security to the persons and
    property of the members of the community.

- prompt: "5 This being admitted, can it be denied that the education of the common  \npeople is a most effectual means of securing our persons and our property?  \nLet Adam Smith answer that question for me. His authority, always high,  \nis, on this subject, entitled to peculiar respect, because he extremely disliked  \nbusy, prying, interfering governments. He was for leaving literature, arts,  \nsciences, to take care of themselves. He was of opinion that the State ought  \nnot to meddle with the education of the rich. But he has expressly told us  \nthat a distinction is to be made, particularly in a commercial and highly  \ncivilised society, between the education of the rich and the education of the  \npoor. The education of the poor, he says, is a matter which deeply concerns  \nthe commonwealth. Just as the magistrate ought to interfere for the purpose  \nof preventing the leprosy from spreading among the people, he ought to  \ninterfere for the purpose of stopping the progress of the moral distempers  \nwhich are inseparable from ignorance. Nor can this duty be neglected with-  \nout danger to the public peace. If you leave the multitude uninstructed, there  \nis serious risk that religious animosities may produce the most dreadful dis-  \norders. The most dreadful disorders! Those are Adam Smith's own words;  \nand prophetic words they were. Scarcely had he given this warning to our  \nrulers when his prediction was fulfilled in a manner never to be forgotten.  \nI speak of the No Popery riots of 1780. I do not know that I could find in all  \nhistory a stronger proof of the proposition that the ignorance of the common  \npeople makes the property, the limbs, the lives of all classes insecure. Without  \nthe shadow of a grievance, at the summons of a madman, a hundred thousand  \npeople rise in insurrection. During a whole week, there is anarchy in the  \ngreatest and wealthiest of European cities. The parliament is besieged. Your  \npredecessor sits trembling in his chair and expects every moment to see the  \ndoor beaten in by the ruffians whose roar he hears all round the house. The  \npeers are pulled out of their coaches. The bishops in their lawn are forced to fly over the tiles. The chapels of foreign ambassadors, buildings made\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Smith''s Educational Philosophy**\n\nSmith argues that while the state should not meddle with the education of the rich, it must intervene in the education of the poor. Using the text provided, explain why Smith believes this distinction is crucial for societal stability.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key difference between the education of the rich and the poor as per Smith.\n- **Step 2**: Reference his analogy with leprosy prevention to justify the necessity of state involvement.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how neglecting this duty risks public peace, using the example of the No Popery riots.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate Smith''s reasoning and demonstrate an understanding of the societal implications of his argument.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Interpretation of Smith''s Predictive Insight**\n\nSmith prophesies that the ignorance of the common people will lead to ''the most dreadful disorders,'' which were realized in the No Popery riots of 1780. Using the text, explain how Smith''s warning was fulfilled in this event.\n- **Step 1**: Describe the context of the No Popery riots.\n- **Step 2**: Link the lack of education among the populace to the outbreak of violence.\n- **Step 3**: Analyze how Smith''s prediction reflects a broader concern about the dangers of ignorance in society.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must connect Smith''s argument to the historical event with clear logical reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Educational and Political Implications**\n\nConsider the role of education in maintaining societal order, as discussed by Smith. Construct an argument that combines his views on the state''s responsibility in education with the broader implications of political and social stability.\n- **Step 1**: Summarize Smith''s stance on the state''s role in education.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how ignorance leads to social unrest, using the No Popery riots as an example.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a solution that aligns with Smith''s philosophy, ensuring that both the wealthy and the poor receive appropriate educational treatment.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must integrate Smith''s ideas and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the political and social consequences of education policies.'

    sacred by the law of nations, are destroyed. The house of the Chief Justice
    is demolished. The little children of the Prime Minister are taken out of
    their beds and laid in their night clothes on the table of the Horse Guards,
    the only safe asylum from the fury of the rabble. The prisons are opened.
    [1ighwaymen, housebreakers, murderers, come forth to swell the mob by
    which they have been set free. Thirty-six fires are blazing at once in London.
    Then comes the retribution. Count up all the wretches who were shot, who
    were hanged, who were crushed, who drank themselves to death at the
    rivers of gin which ran down Holborn Hill; and you will find that battles
    have been lost and won with a smaller sacrifice of life. And what was the
    cause of this calamity, a calamity which, in the history of London ranks
    316 ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL

    with the great plague and the great fire? The cause was the ignorance of a
    population which had been suffered, in the neighbourhood of palaces, theatres,
    temples, to grow up as rude and stupid as any tribe of tattooed cannibals in
    New Zealand, I might say as any drove of beasts in Smithfield Market.

    6 The instance is striking; but it is not solitary. To the same cause are to
    be ascribed the riots of Nottingham, the sack of Bristol, all the outrages of
    Ludd, and Swing, and Rebecca, beautiful and costly machinery broken to
    pieces in Yorkshire, barns and haystacks blazing in Kent, fences and build-
    ings pulled down in Wales. Could such things have been done in a country
    in which the mind of the labourer had been opened by education, in which
    he had been taught to find pleasure in the exercise of his intellect, taught to
    revere his Maker, taught to respect legitimate authority, and taught at the
    same time to seek the redress of real wrongs by peaceful and constitutional
    means?

    7 This then is my argument. It is the duty of Government to protect our
    persons and property from danger. The gross ignorance of the common
    people is a principal cause of danger to our persons and property. Therefore,
    it is the duty of the Government to take care that the common people shall
    not be grossly ignorant.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Argument and Historical Context**\n\nUsing the passage provided, analyze the author''s argument in two parts: \n- **Part A**: Identify the central claim and the supporting premises. Explain how these elements are structured to build a logical case for the author''s position. \n- **Part B**: Evaluate the rhetorical strategy used to emphasize the consequences of ignorance, such as the reference to ''the great plague and the great fire.'' How does this comparison enhance the author''s argument? \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference specific examples from the text and demonstrate an understanding of the author''s logical structure and rhetorical devices.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Social and Political Implications**\n\nThe author contrasts the chaos caused by ignorance with the potential benefits of education. \n- **Part A**: Compare and contrast the scenarios described in the text (e.g., the riots, destruction of property, violence) with the hypothetical situation where education is widespread. How does this contrast serve the author''s purpose? \n- **Part B**: Discuss the moral implications of the author''s argument. Does the author imply that ignorance is inherently immoral? Support your answer with evidence from the text. \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate a clear comparison of scenarios and demonstrate an understanding of the moral dimensions of the author''s argument.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning and Historical Context**\n\nThe author states that ''it is the duty of Government to protect our persons and property from danger.'' \n- **Part A**: Explain how the author logically connects the ''gross ignorance of the common people'' to the danger to persons and property. \n- **Part B**: Consider the historical context of the text (e.g., the ''great plague and the great fire'' mentioned in the passage). How does this context reinforce or challenge the author''s argument? \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the historical context and demonstrate a logical understanding of the author''s argument.'

- prompt: "8 And what is the alternative? It is universally allowed that, by some  \nmeans, Government must protect our persons and property. If you take away  \neducation, what means do you leave? You leave means such as only necessity  \ncan justify, means which inflict a fearful amount of pain, not only on the  \nguilty, but on the innocent who are connected with the guilty. You leave  \nguns and bayonets, stocks and whipping-posts, treadmills, solitary cells, penal  \ncolonies, gibbets. See then how the case stands. Here is an end which, as we  \nall agree, governments are bound to attain. There are only two ways of  \nattaining it. One of those ways is by making men better, and wiser, and  \nhappier. The other way is by making them infamous and miserable. Can  \nit be doubted which way we ought to prefer? Is it not strange, is it not  \nalmost incredible, that pious and benevolent men should gravely propound  \nthe doctrine that the magistrate is bound to punish and at the same time  \nbound not to teach? To me it seems quite clear that whoever has a right to  \nhang has a right to educate.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Government and Education**\n\nUsing the text, argue whether a government''s responsibility to educate is as fundamental as its responsibility to protect persons and property.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the author''s claim that ''the magistrate is bound to punish and at the same time bound not to teach''.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast the two methods of achieving government''s end: ''making men better, wiser, and happier'' versus ''making them infamous and miserable''.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the author concludes that ''whoever has a right to hang has a right to educate'' by referencing the text''s examples of prisons and penal colonies.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must directly address the text''s central claim and use specific examples from the passage to support your reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Governmental Means**\n\nThe text presents a moral dilemma: if governments must protect property and persons, what is the ethical justification for using harsh means like stocks, whippings, and prisons?\n- **Part A**: Explain the author''s argument that ''making men better'' is the preferable method over ''making them infamous and miserable''.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the text''s reference to ''Newgate'' and ''Norfolk Island'' as evidence that educational reform could prevent such institutions.\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument that if governments failed to educate, they would be ''hunting and torturing rogues'' rather than ''training honest men''.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s examples and use logical reasoning to support your conclusion.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Ethical Philosophy**\n\nThe author argues that education is a moral obligation for the government. Create a hypothetical scenario where a government chooses to prioritize punishment over education, and analyze the ethical implications of this decision.\n- **Part A**: Describe a fictional society where punishment is the primary method of governance.\n- **Part B**: Use the text''s examples (e.g., ''treadmills'', ''solitary cells'') to explain the consequences of such a policy.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate whether this approach aligns with the author''s assertion that ''the magistrate is bound to teach'' by referencing the text''s discussion on the purpose of government.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your scenario must directly address the text''s central argument and demonstrate an understanding of its ethical implications.'

    Committee of Council. I speak of the report made by Mr. Seymour Tremenheare
    on the state of that part of Monmouthshire which is inhabited by a population chiefly employed in mining. He found that, in this district, towards the
    close of 1839, out of eleven thousand children who were of an age to attend
    school, eight thousand never went to any school at all, and that most of the
    remaining three thousand might almost as well have gone to no school as to
    the squalid hovels in which men who ought themselves to have been learn-
    ers pretended to teach. In general these men had only one qualification
    for their employment; and that was their utter unfitness for every other
    employment. They were disabled miners or broken hucksters. In their schools
    all was stench and noise and confusion. Now and then the clamour of the
    boys was silenced for two minutes by the furious menaces of the master; but
    it soon broke out again. The instruction given was of the lowest kind. Not
    one school in ten was provided with a single map. This is the way in which
    you suffered the minds of a great population to be formed. And now for the
    effects of your negligence. The barbarian inhabitants of this region rise in
    an insane rebellion against the Government. They come pouring down their
    valleys to Newport. They fire on the Queen's troops. They wound a magis-
    trate. The soldiers fire in return; and too many of these wretched men pay
    with their lives the penalty of their crime. But is the crime theirs alone? Is
    it strange that they should listen to the only teaching that they had? How
    can you, who took no pains to instruct them, blame them for giving ear to
    the demagogue who took pains to delude them? We put them down, of
    course. We punished them. We had no choice. Order must be maintained;
    property must be protected; and, since we had omitted to take the best way
    of keeping these people quiet, we were under the necessity of keeping them
    quiet by the dread of the sword and the halter. But could any necessity be
    more cruel? And which of us would run the risk of being placed under
    such necessity a second time?

    Take us as a pattern. Go back to the days when the little society which has expanded into the opulent and enlightened commonwealth of Massachusetts began to exist. Our modern Dissenters will scarcely, I think, venture to speak contumeliously of those Puritans whose spirit Laud and his High Commission Court could not subdue, of those Puritans who were willing to leave home and kindred, and all the comforts and refinements of civilised life, to cross the ocean, to fix their abode in forests among wild beasts and wild men, rather than commit the sin of performing, in the House of God, one gesture which they believed to be displeasing to Him. Did those brave exiles think it inconsistent with civil or religious freedom that the State should take charge of the education of the people? No, sir; one of the earliest laws enacted by the Puritan colonists was that every township, as soon as the Lord had increased it to the number of fifty houses, should appoint one to teach all children to write and read, and that every township of a hundred houses should set up a grammar school. Nor have the descendants of those who made this law ever ceased to hold that the public authorities were bound to provide the means of public instruction. Nor is this doctrine confined to New England. "Educate the people" was the first admonition addressed by Penn to the colony which he founded. "Educate the people" was the legacy of Washington to the nation which he had saved. "Educate the people" was the unceasing exhortation of Jefferson; and I quote Jefferson with peculiar pleasure, because, of all the eminent men that have ever lived, Adam Smith himself not excepted, Jefferson was the one who most abhorred everything like meddling on the part of governments. Yet the chief business of his later years was to establish a good system of State education in Virginia.

    It is odious tyranny in a government to attempt to prevent crime by informing the understanding and elevating the moral feeling of a people. A statesman may see hamlets turned, in the course of one generation, into great seaport towns and manufacturing towns. He may know that on the character of the vast population which is collected in those wonderful towns depends the prosperity, the peace, the very existence of society. But he must not think of forming that character. He is an enemy of public liberty if he attempts to prevent those hundreds of thousands of his countrymen from becoming mere Yahoos. He may, indeed, build barrack after barrack to overawe them. If they break out into insurrection, he may send cavalry to sabre them; he may mow them down with grape shot; he may hang them, draw them, quarter them, anything but teach them. He may see, and may shudder as he sees, throughout large rural districts, millions of infants growing up from infancy to manhood as ignorant, as mere slaves of sensual appetite, as the beasts that perish. No matter. He is a traitor to the cause of civil and religious freedom if he does not look on with folded arms, while absurd hopes and evil passions ripen in that rank soil. He must wait for the day of his harvest. He must wait till the Jaquerie comes, till farm houses are burning, till threshing machines are broken in pieces; and then begins his business, which is simply to send one poor ignorant savage to the county gaol, and another to the antipodes, and a third to the gallows.

    a4 Such, Sir, is the new theory of government which was first propounded
    in the year 1846, by some men of high note among the Nonconformists of
    England. It is difficult to understand how men of excellent abilities and
    excellent intentions—and there are, I readily admit, such men among those
    who hold this theory—can have fallen into so absurd and pernicious an
    error. One explanation only occurs to me. This is, I am inclined to believe,
    an instance of the operation of the great law of reaction. We have just come
    victorious out of a long and fierce contest for the liberty of trade. While
    that contest was undecided, much was said and written about the advantages
    of free competition and about the danger of suffering the State to regulate
    matters which should be left to individuals. There has consequently arisen
    in the minds of persons who are led by words and who are little in the habit
    of making distinctions a disposition to apply to political questions and moral
    questions principles which are sound only when applied to commercial
    questions. These people, not content with having forced the Government
    to surrender a province wrongfully usurped, now wish to wrest from the
    Government a domain held by a right which was never before questioned
    and which cannot be questioned with the smallest show of reason. "If," they
    say, "free competition is a good thing in trade, it must surely be a good
    thing in education. The supply of other commodities, of sugar, for example,
    is left to adjust itself to the demand; and the consequence is that we are
    320 ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL

    better supplied with sugar than if the Government undertook to supply us.
    Why then should we doubt that the supply of instruction will, without the
    intervention of the Government, be found equal to the demand?"

    15 Never was there a more false analogy. Whether a man is well supplied with sugar is a matter which concerns himself alone. But whether he is well supplied with instruction is a matter which concerns his neighbours and the State. If he cannot afford to pay for sugar, he must go without sugar. But it is by no means fit that, because he cannot afford to pay for education, he should go without education. Between the rich and their instructors there may, as Adam Smith says, be free trade. The supply of music masters and Italian masters may be left to adjust itself to the demand. But what is to become of the millions who are too poor to procure without assistance the services of a decent schoolmaster? We have indeed heard it said that even these millions will be supplied with teachers by the free competition of benevolent individuals who will vie with each other in rendering this service to mankind. No doubt there are many benevolent individuals who spend their time and money most laudably in setting up and supporting schools; and you may say, if you please, that there is, among these respectable persons, a competition to do good. But do not be imposed upon by words. Do not believe that this competition resembles the competition which is produced by the desire of wealth and by the fear of ruin. There is a great difference, be assured, between the rivalry of philanthropists and the rivalry of grocers. The grocer knows that if his wares are worse than those of other grocers, he shall soon go before the Bankrupt Court, and his wife and children will have no refuge but the workhouse; he knows that if his shop obtains an honourable celebrity, he shall be able to set up a carriage and buy a villa; and this knowledge impels him to exertions compared with which the exertions of even very charitable people to serve the poor are but languid. It would be strange infatuation indeed to legislate on the supposition that a man cares for his fellow creatures as much as he cares for himself.

    16 Unless, Sir, I greatly deceive myself, those arguments, which show that
    the Government ought not to leave to private people the task of providing
    for the national defence, will equally show that the Government ought not
    to leave to private people the task of providing for national education. On
    this subject, Mr. Hume has laid down the general law with admirable good
    sense and perspicuity. I mean David Hume, not the Member for Montrose,
    though that honourable gentleman will, I am confident, assent to the doctrine
    propounded by his illustrious namesake. David Hume, Sir, justly says that
    most of the arts and trades which exist in the world produce so much
    advantage and pleasure to individuals that the magistrate may safely leave
    it to individuals to encourage those arts and trades. But he adds that there
    are callings which, though they are highly useful, nay, absolutely necessary
    to society, yet do not administer to the peculiar pleasure or profit of any
    individual. The military calling is an instance. Here, says Hume, the gov-
    ernment must interfere. It must take on itself to regulate these callings and
    to stimulate the industry of the persons who follow these callings by pecuniary
    and honourary rewards.

    17 Now, Sir, it seems to me that, on the same principle on which Government ought to superintend and to reward the soldier, Government ought to superintend and to reward the schoolmaster. I mean, of course, the schoolmaster of the common people. That his calling is useful, that his calling is necessary, will hardly be denied. Yet it is clear that his services will not be adequately remunerated if he is left to be remunerated by those whom he teaches or by the voluntary contributions of the charitable. Is this disputed? Look at the facts. You tell us that schools will multiply and flourish exceedingly, if the Government will only abstain from interfering with them. Has not the Government long abstained from interfering with them? Has not everything been left, through many years, to individual exertion? If it were true that education, like trade, thrives most where the magistrate meddles least, the common people of England would now be the best educated in the world. Our schools would be model schools. Everyone would have a well chosen little library, excellent maps, a small but neat apparatus for experiments in natural philosophy. A grown person unable to read and write would be pointed at like Giant O'Brien or the Polish Count. Our schoolmasters would be as eminently expert in all that relates to teaching as our cutlers, our cottonspinners, our engineers are allowed to be in their respective callings. They would, as a class, be held in high consideration; and their gains would be such that it would be easy to find men of respectable character and attainments to fill up vacancies.

    18 Now, is this the case? Look at the charges of the judges, at the resolutions of the grand juries, at the reports of public officers, at the reports of voluntary associations. All tell the same sad and ignominious story. Take the reports of the Inspectors of Prisons. In the House of Correction at Hertford, of seven hundred prisoners one half could not read at all; only eight could read and write well. Of eight thousand prisoners who had passed through Maidstone Prison, the proportion that could read and write well seems to have been still smaller. Turn from the registers of prisoners to the registers of marriages. You will find that about a hundred and thirty thousand couples were married in the year 1844. More than forty thousand of the bridegrooms and more than sixty thousand of the brides did not sign their names, but made their marks.

Tens of thousands who were able to write their names had in all probability received only the wretched education of a common day school. We know what such a school too often is: a room crusted with filth, without light, without air, with a heap of fuel in one corner and a brood of chickens in another; the only machinery of instruction a dog-eared spelling-book and a broken slate; the masters the refuse of all other callings, discarded footmen, ruined pedlars, men who cannot work a sum in the rule of three, men who cannot write a common letter without blunders, men who do not know whether the earth is a sphere or a cube, men who do not know whether Jerusalem is in Asia or America.

    It would be shocked to see so much barbarism in the close neighbourhood of so much wealth and civilisation. But is it not strange that the very gentlemen who tell us in such emphatic language that the people are shamefully ill-educated should yet persist in telling us that under a system of free competition the people are certain to be excellently educated? Only this morning the opponents of our plan circulated a paper in which they confidently predict that free competition will do all that is necessary, if we will only wait with patience. Wait with patience! Why, we have been waiting ever since the Heptarchy. How much longer are we to wait! Till the year 2847? Or till the year 3847? That the experiment has as yet failed you do not deny. And why should it have failed? Has it been tried in unfavourable circumstances? Not so; it has been tried in the richest, and in the freest, and in the most charitable country in all Europe. Has it been tried on too small a scale? Not so; millions have been subjected to it. Has it been tried during too short a time? Not so; it has been going on during ages. The cause of the failure then is plain. Our whole system has been unsound. We have applied the principle of free competition to a case to which that principle is not applicable.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning in Argumentation**\n\nEvaluate the author''s claim that "the experiment has as yet failed" based on the evidence provided in the passage.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the conditions under which the experiment was conducted (richest, freest, most charitable country).\n- **Step 2**: Assess the scale of the experiment (millions subjected to it, ages of implementation).\n- **Step 3**: Determine the author''s reasoning for concluding failure despite these factors.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s evidence with logical reasoning to defend or challenge the author''s conclusion about the experiment''s failure.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Rhetorical Analysis**\n\nConstruct a counter-argument to the author''s position that free competition is inherently flawed. Use at least two rhetorical strategies from the passage (e.g., repetition, rhetorical questions) and incorporate a logical rebuttal to the author''s claim about systemic unsoundness.\n- **Strategy 1**: Employ a rhetorical question similar to the author''s, but frame it to question the validity of their premises.\n- **Strategy 2**: Use repetition of a key term (e.g., "Has it been tried...?" but in your argument, rephrase it to challenge the author''s conclusion).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your counter-argument must be coherent, use the specified rhetorical strategies, and logically address the author''s central claim about the failure of free competition.'

    20 But, Sir, if the state of the southern part of our island has furnished me
    with one strong argument, the state of the northern part furnishes me with
    another argument, which is, if possible, still more decisive. A hundred and
    fifty years ago England was one of the best governed and most prosperous
    countries in the world; Scotland was perhaps the rudest and poorest country
    that could lay any claim to civilisation. The name of Scotchman was then
    uttered in this part of the island with contempt. The ablest Scotch statesmen
    contemplated the degraded state of their poorer countrymen with a feeling
    approaching to despair. It is well known that Fletcher of Saltoun, a brave
    and accomplished man, a man who had drawn his sword for liberty, who
    had suffered proscription and exile for liberty, was so much disgusted and
    dismayed by the misery, the ignorance, the idleness, the lawlessness of the
    common people, that he proposed to make many thousands of them slaves.
    Nothing, he thought, but the discipline which kept order and enforced
    exertion among the negroes of a sugar colony, nothing but the lash and the
    stocks, could reclaim the vagabonds who infested every part of Scotland from
    their indolent and predatory habits, and compel them to support themselves
    by steady labour. He therefore, soon after the Revolution, published a pam-
    phlet, in which he earnestly and, as I believe, from the mere impulse of
    humanity and patriotism, recommended to the Estates of the Realm this
    sharp remedy, which alone, as he conceived, could remove the evil. Within
    a few months after the publication of that pamphlet a very different remedy
    was applied. The Parliament which sat at Edinburgh passed an act for the
    establishment of parochial schools. What followed? An improvement such

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Argument Structure**\n\nAnalyze the rhetorical structure of Corbett''s argument in the provided passage. Identify and explain at least three distinct components of his argumentative strategy, including:\n- The use of historical comparison to contrast the state of Scotland before and after specific events\n- The inclusion of a notable historical figure (Fletcher of Saltoun) to support his claim\n- The contrast between two proposed solutions (slavery and education) and their potential consequences\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of rhetorical strategies and their application in historical argumentation, without reference to external sources.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Devices**\n\nIdentify and explain the rhetorical devices used in the passage to persuade the reader. Specifically, address:\n- The use of anaphora (repetition of a phrase or structure)\n- The use of ethos, pathos, and logos in the argumentation\n- The use of historical examples to build credibility (the reference to Fletcher of Saltoun)\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must connect the rhetorical devices to their function in persuasion, using explicit examples from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Historical Context**\n\nEvaluate the logical coherence of Corbett''s argument. Consider the following:\n- The assumption that the condition of Scotland in 1715 was representative of its broader societal issues\n- The implication that the proposed solutions (slavery and education) would lead to specific outcomes\n- The connection between Fletcher of Saltoun''s personal experiences and his proposed reforms\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must critically assess the argument''s logic, identify any potential weaknesses or assumptions, and explain how historical context influences the validity of the argument.'

    As the world had never seen, took place in the moral and intellectual character
    of the people. Soon, in spite of the rigour of the climate, in spite of the
    sterility of the earth, Scotland became a country which had no reason to
    envy the fairest portions of the globe. Wherever the Scotchman went—and
    there were few parts of the world to which he did not go—he carried his
    superiority with him. If he was admitted into a public office, he worked his
    way up to the highest post. If he got employment in a brewery or a factory,
    he was soon the foreman. If he took a shop, his trade was the best in the
    street. If he enlisted in the army, he became a colour-serjeant. If he went to
    a colony, he was the most thriving planter there. The Scotchman of the
    seventeenth century had been spoken of in London as we speak of the
    Esquimaux. The Scotchman of the eighteenth century was an object, not of
    scorn, but of envy. The cry was that, wherever he came, he got more than
    his share; that, mixed with Englishmen or mixed with Irishmen, he rose
    to the top as surely as oil rises to the top of water. And what had produced
    this great revolution? The Scotch air was still as cold, the Scotch rocks were
    still as bare as ever. All the natural qualities of the Scotchman were still
    what they had been when learned and benevolent men advised that he
    should be flogged, like a beast of burden, to his daily task. But the State had
    given him an education. That education was not, it is true, in all respects
    what it should have been. But, such as it was, it had done more for the
    bleak and dreary shores of the Forth and the Clyde than the richest of soils
    and the most genial of climates had done for Capua and Tarentum. Is there
    one member of this House, however strongly he may hold the doctrine that
    the Government ought not to interfere with the education of the people,
    who will stand up and say that, in his opinion, the Scotch would now have
    been a happier and a more enlightened people if they had been left, during
    the last five generations, to find instruction for themselves?

    21 I say then, Sir, that if the science of Government be an experimental
    science this question is decided. We are in a condition to perform the
    inductive process according to the rules laid down in the Novum Organum.
    We have two nations closely connected, inhabiting the same island, sprung
    from the same blood, speaking the same language, governed by the same
    Sovereign and the same Legislature, holding essentially the same religious
    faith, having the same allies and the same enemies. Of these two nations
    one was, a hundred and fifty years ago, as respects opulence and civilisation,
    in the highest rank among European communities; the other in the lowest
    rank. The opulent and highly civilised nation leaves the education of the
    people to free competition. In the poor and half barbarous nation the educa-
    tion of the people is undertaken by the State. The result is that the first
    are last and the last first. The common people of Scotland—it is vain to
    disguise the truth—have passed the common people of England. Free com-
    petition, tried with every advantage, has produced effects of which, as the
    Congregational Union tell us, we ought to be ashamed and which must
    lower us in the opinion of every intelligent foreigner. State education, tried
    under every disadvantage, has produced an improvement to which it would
    be difficult to find a parallel in any age or country. Such an experiment as
    this would be regarded as conclusive in surgery or chemistry, and ought, I
    think, to be regarded as equally conclusive in politics.

    22 These, Sir, are the reasons which have satisfied me that it is the duty
    of the State to educate the people. Being firmly convinced of that truth, I
    shall not shrink from proclaiming it here and elsewhere, in defiance of the
    loudest clamour that agitators can raise. The remainder of my task is easy.
    For if the great principle for which I have been contending is admitted,
    the objections which have been made to the details of our plan will vanish
    fast. I will deal with those objections in the order in which they stand in
    the amendment moved by the honourable Member for Finsbury.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing the Role of Experimentation in Political Theory**\n\nThe author argues that the state should educate the people based on an experiment comparing two nations. Using the text, explain why this experiment is analogous to a scientific method in fields like surgery or chemistry.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key elements of the scientific method as described in the text (hypothesis, variables, control group, etc.).\n- **Step 2**: Apply these elements to the comparison between the two nations.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the author believes this experiment provides conclusive evidence for the state''s role in education.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly link the political experiment to scientific methodology and demonstrate understanding of the author''s reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluating the Logical Consistency of Political Arguments**\n\nThe author claims that state education has produced ''an improvement to which it would be difficult to find a parallel in any age or country.'' Critically evaluate this claim using the structure of the argument presented.\n- **Step 1**: Outline the premises supporting this conclusion (opulence, civilization, education systems).\n- **Step 2**: Identify any assumptions that underlie this conclusion.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a counterargument based on different criteria for measuring educational success.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an ability to analyze the argument''s structure and challenge its conclusion logically.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesizing Political Principles with Rhetorical Strategies**\n\nThe author uses rhetorical strategies to persuade the reader of the necessity of state education. Identify and explain three such strategies, providing textual evidence for each.\n- **Part A**: Use of analogies (e.g., comparing the experiment to surgery or chemistry).\n- **Part B**: Use of contrast (e.g., comparing the two nations'' educational systems).\n- **Part C**: Use of emotional appeal (e.g., the ''vain to disguise the truth'' statement).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate rhetorical analysis with political theory and demonstrate a deep understanding of the author''s persuasive techniques.'

    23 First among his objections he places the cost. Surely, Sir, no person who
    admits that it is our duty to train the minds of the rising generation can
    think a hundred thousand pounds too large a sum for that purpose. If we
    look at the matter in the lowest point of view, if we consider human beings
    merely as producers of wealth, the difference between an intelligent and a
    stupid population, estimated in pounds, shillings, and pence, exceeds a hun-
    dredfold the proposed outlay. Nor is this all. For every pound that you have
    saved in education, you will spend five in prosecution, in prisons, in penal
    settlements. I cannot believe that the House, having never grudged anything
    that was asked for the purpose of maintaining order and protecting property
    by means of pain and fear, will begin to be niggardly as soon as it is proposed
    to effect the same objects by making the people wiser and better.

    24 The next objection made by the honourable Member to our plan is that
    it will increase the influence of the Crown. This sum of a hundred thou-
    sand pounds may, he apprehends, be employed in corruption and jobbing.
    Those schoolmasters who vote for ministerial candidates will obtain a share
    of the grant; those schoolmasters who vote for opponents of the ministry
    will apply for assistance in vain. Sir, the honourable Member never would
    have made this objection if he had taken the trouble to understand the
    minutes which he has condemned. We propose to place this part of the
    public expenditure under checks which must make such abuses as the hon-
    ourable Member anticipates morally impossible. Not only will there be those
    ordinary checks which are thought sufficient to prevent the misapplication
    of the many millions annually granted for the army, the navy, the ord-
    nance, the civil government; not only must the Ministers of the Crown
    come every year to this House for a vote and be prepared to render an
    account of the manner in which they have laid out what had been voted in

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Ethical Argumentation\n\nThe speaker argues that investing in education is not only a moral duty but also economically prudent. Using the reasoning presented, construct a counterargument that challenges the claim that "education is more cost-effective than punitive measures." Your argument must incorporate at least two of the speaker''s key points: the comparison between intelligent and stupid populations in terms of productivity, and the cost-effectiveness of education versus incarceration.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must logically refute the original claim using premises from the text and demonstrate an understanding of the ethical implications of education versus punishment.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Analysis of Political Rhetoric\n\nThe speaker addresses the objection that the education plan will increase the Crown''s influence. Using the text, explain why this objection is logically flawed. Your response must include:\n- A direct quote from the text that supports your argument\n- An analysis of how the proposed system "places public expenditure under checks" to prevent abuse\n- A comparison between the current system of military spending and the proposed education funding model\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the political and administrative mechanisms described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Logical Reasoning on Public Policy\n\nThe speaker asserts that "the difference between an intelligent and a stupid population, estimated in pounds, shillings, and pence, exceeds a hundredfold the proposed outlay." Using this statement, create a hypothetical scenario that illustrates the economic impact of education on society. Your scenario must:\n- Include at least two specific economic outcomes derived from the speaker''s reasoning\n- Reference the "five pounds in prosecution" argument as a comparative cost\n- Demonstrate how education reduces long-term societal costs through logical reasoning\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must be a coherent, self-contained scenario that directly applies the speaker''s economic arguments to real-world consequences.'

    the preceding year; but when they have satisfied the House, when they pave
    got their vote, they will still be unable to distribute the money at their
    discretion. Whatever they may do for any schoolmaster must be done in
    concert with those persons who, in the district where the schoolmaster lives,
    take an interest in education and contribute out of their private means to
    the expense of education. When the honourable gentleman is afraid‘ that we
    shall corrupt the schoolmasters, he forgets, first, that we do not appoint the
    schoolmasters; secondly, that we cannot dismiss the schoolmasters; thirdly,
    that managers who are altogether independent of us can, without our con-
    sent, dismiss the schoolmasters; and fourthly, that without the recommenda-
    tion of those managers we can give nothing to the schoolmasters. Observe,
    too, that such a recommendation will not be one of those recommendations
    which goodnatured easy people are too apt to give to everybody who asks;
    nor will it at all resemble those recommendations which the Secretary of the
    Treasury is in the habit of receiving. For every pound which we pay on the
    recommendation of the managers, the managers themselves must pay two
    pounds. They must also provide the schoolmaster with a house out of their
    own funds before they can obtain for him a grant from the public funds.
    What chance of jobbing is there here? It is common enough, no doubt, for
    a Member of Parliament who votes with Government to ask that one of
    those who zealously supported him at the last election may have a place
    in the Excise or the Customs. But such a member would soon cease to
    solicit if the answer were, "Your friend shall have a place of fifty pounds
    a year, if you will give him a house and settle on him an income of a
    hundred a year." What chance then, I again ask, is there of jobbing? What,
    say some of the dissenters of Leeds, is to prevent a Tory Government, a
    High Church Government, from using this parliamentary grant to corrupt
    the schoolmasters of our borough and to induce them to use all their in-
    fluence in favour of a Tory and High Church candidate? Why, Sir, the
    dissenters of Leeds themselves have the power to prevent it. Let them sub-

    I submit to the schools; let them take a share in the management of the schools; let them refuse to recommend to the Committee of Council any school-master whom they suspect of having voted at any election from corrupt motives; and the thing is done. Our plan, in truth, is made up of checks. My only doubt is whether the checks may not be found too numerous and too stringent. On our general conduct there is the ordinary check, the parliamentary check. And, as respects those minute details which it is impossible that this House can investigate, we shall be checked, in every town and in every rural district, by boards consisting of independent men zealous in the cause of education.

    25 The truth is, Sir, that those who clamour most loudly against our plan have never thought of ascertaining what it is. I see that a gentleman, who ought to have known better, has not been ashamed publicly to tell the world that our plan will cost the nation two millions a year and will paralyse all the exertions of individuals to educate the people. These two assertions are uttered in one breath. And yet, if he who made them had read our minutes before he railed at them, he would have seen that his predictions are contradictory; that they cannot both be fulfilled; that, if individuals do not exert themselves, the country will have to pay nothing; and that, if the country has to pay two millions, it will be because individuals have exerted themselves with such wonderful, such incredible, vigour as to raise four millions by voluntary contributions.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Educational Governance Philosophy**\n\nSummarize the author''s argument regarding the role of local boards in educational management. Use at least two examples from the text to support your analysis.\n- **Example 1**: The author mentions that local boards consist of "independent men zealous in the cause of education." Explain how this reflects a decentralized approach to education.\n- **Example 2**: The author states that these boards will "check" the actions of school-masters. Describe how this checks mechanism functions within the proposed system.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your summary must explicitly reference at least two examples and demonstrate an understanding of the author''s vision for educational governance.'

Construct a logical argument that refutes the gentleman''s claim that the plan will "cost the nation two millions a year". Use the following structure:\n- **Premise 1**: If individuals exert themselves, the country will pay nothing.\n- **Premise 2**: If the country pays two millions, it is because individuals have exerted themselves.\n- **Conclusion**: Therefore, the plan''s cost is contingent on individual effort, and the gentleman''s claim is contradictory.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must logically follow from the premises provided and explicitly reference the author''s reasoning about individual responsibility in education.'

    26 The next objection made by the honourable Member for Finsbury is that we have acted unconstitutionally and have encroached on the functions of Parliament. The Committee of Council he seems to consider as an unlawful assembly. He calls it sometimes a self-elected body and sometimes a self- appointed body. Sir, these are words without meaning. The Committee is no more a self-elected body than the Board of Trade. It is a body appointed by the Queen; and in appointing it, Her Majesty has exercised, under the advice of her responsible Ministers, a prerogative as old as the monarchy. But, says the honourable Member, the constitutional course would have been to apply for an Act of Parliament. On what ground? Nothing but an Act of Parliament can legalise that which is illegal. But whoever heard of an Act of Parliament to legalise what was already beyond all dispute legal? Of course, if we wished to send aliens out of the country or to detail disaffected persons in custody without bringing them to trial, we must obtain an Act of Parliament empowering us to do so. But why should we ask for an Act of Parliament to empower us to do what anybody may do, what the honourable Member for Finsbury may do? Is there any doubt that he or anybody else may subscribe to a school, give a stipend to a monitor, or settle a retiring pension on a preceptor who has done good service? What any of the Queen's subjects may do the Queen may do. Suppose that her privy purse were so large that she could afford to employ a hundred thousand pounds in this beneficent manner; would an Act of Parliament be necessary to enable her to do so? Every part of our plan may lawfully be carried into execution by any person, Sovereign or subject, who has the inclination and the money. We have not the money; and for the money we come, in a strictly constitutional manner, to the House of Commons. The course which we have taken is in conformity with all precedent, as well as with all principle. There are military schools. No Act of Parliament was necessary to authorise the establishing of such schools. All that was necessary was a grant of money.

    against them had done the same. I say that I have carefully read and consid-
    ered them and that they seem to me to have been drawn up with exemplary
    impartiality. The benefits which we offer we offer to people of all religious
    persuasions alike. The dissenting managers of schools will have equal author-
    ity with the managers who belong to the Church. A boy who goes to meeting
    will be just as eligible to be a monitor and will receive just as large a stipend,
    as if he went to the cathedral. The schoolmaster who is a nonconformist
    and the schoolmaster who is a conformist will enjoy the same emoluments
    and will, after the same term of service, obtain, on the same conditions, the
    same retiring pension. I wish that some gentleman would, instead of using
    vague phrases about religious liberty and the rights of conscience, answer
    this plain question. Suppose that in one of our large towns there are four
    schools, a school connected with the Church, a school connected with the
    Independents, a Baptist school, and a Wesleyan school; what encouragement,
    pecuniary or honorary, will, by our plan, be given to the school connected
    with the Church, and withheld from any of the other three schools? Is it
    not indeed plain that, if by neglect or maladministration the Church school
    should get into a bad state, while the dissenting schools flourish, the dis-
    senting schools will receive public money and the Church school will receive
    none?

    28 It is true, I admit, that in rural districts which are too poor to support
    more than one school the religious community to which the majority belongs
    will have an advantage over other religious communities. But this is not our
    fault. If we are as impartial as it is possible to be, you surely do not expect
    more. If there should be a parish containing nine hundred churchmen and
    a hundred dissenters, if there should, in that parish, be a school connected
    with the Church, if the dissenters in that parish should be too poor to set up
    another school, undoubtedly the school connected with the Church will, in
    that parish, get all that we give; and the dissenters will get nothing. But
    observe that there is no partiality to the Church, as the Church, in this
    arrangement. The churchmen get public money, not because they are church-
    men, but because they are the majority. The dissenters get nothing, not be-
    cause they are dissenters but because they are a small minority. There are
    districts where the case will be reversed, where there will be dissenting schools,
    and no Church schools. In such cases, the dissenters will get what we have
    to give, and the churchmen will get nothing.

    30 I now come to the last words of the amendment. The honourable Member for Finsbury is apprehensive that our plan may interfere with the civil rights of Her Majesty's subjects. How a man's civil rights can be prejudiced by his learning to read and write, to multiply and divide, or even by his obtaining some knowledge of history and geography, I do not very well apprehend. One thing is clear, that persons sunk in that ignorance in which, as we are assured by the Congregational Union, great numbers of our countrymen are sunk, can be free only in name. It is hardly necessary for us to appoint a Select Committee for the purpose of inquiring whether knowledge be the ally or the enemy of liberty. He is, I must say, but a shortsighted friend of the common people who is eager to bestow on them a franchise which would make them all-powerful, and yet would withhold from them that instruction without which their power must be a curse to themselves and to the State.

    31 This, Sir, is my defence. From the clamour of our accusers I appeal with confidence to the country to which we must, in no long time, render an account of our stewardship. I appeal with still more confidence to future generations, which while enjoying all the blessings of an impartial and efficient system of public instruction, will find it difficult to believe that the authors of that system should have had to struggle with a vehement and pertinacious opposition, and still more difficult to believe that such an opposition was offered in the name of civil and religious freedom.

    ANALYSIS OF MACAULAY'S SPEECH
    WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON ITS ARRANGEMENT

    Macaulay's speech is a fruitful document for the study of the topics of argument, and students might well spend time analyzing the operation of the topics in this piece of deliberative discourse. But although we will frequently refer to the arguments in the speech, the chief emphasis in this analysis will be upon the arrangement and function of the various parts.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Argumentative Structure in Macaulay''s Speech**\n\nExplain the logical progression of Macaulay''s argument in his speech, and how the structure of the text reflects his purpose.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the main thesis or central claim of the speech.\n- **Step 2**: Trace the development of the argument from the opening to the conclusion, referencing key points such as the mention of ''civil rights,'' ''education,'' and ''future generations.''\n- **Step 3**: Analyze how the structure supports his purpose of defending his educational reform plan.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the speech''s organization and its relationship to Macaulay''s argumentative purpose.'

    Several contemporaries have testified that Macaulay's delivery was quite unprepossessing. He spoke rapidly, with very little modulation and inflection of the voice and with few gestures. But for all that, he was a remarkably effective parliamentary orator. His speeches on the First Reform Bill, on Copyright, and on the Ten Hours Bill are regarded as classics of English oratory. It was the substance and style of his speeches which proved so effective with his audiences. As Lord Lytton, one of his political opponents, said of him: "It was certainly, however, the brilliant art with which his speeches were composed upon oratorical principles, both as to arrangement of argument and liveliness of phraseology, that gave them that prodigious effect which they (at least the earlier ones) produced upon a mixed audience, and entitles this eminent personage to the fame of a very considerable orator." Let us analyze Macaulay's strategy in selecting and disposing his arguments in order to win over the opponents of the proposed bill.

    Throughout this chapter on arrangement we have repeatedly observed that it is impossible, in the abstract, to lay down any hard and fast precepts about the proper disposition of the material one has gathered in the process of invention. Considerations of the occasion, the subject matter, the personality of the speaker or writer, the temper of the audience will dictate what the speaker or writer will have to do. Now we have a specific instance, and we can at least speculate about the decisions this particular orator made on this particular occasion.

    First of all, let us look at the over-all organization of the speech:

    Introduction (paragraphs 1-3).
    Proof (paragraphs 4-30)
    A. Confirmation of his own views (paragraphs 4-22)
    B. Refutation of objections (paragraphs 23-30)
    Conclusion (paragraph 30)

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Macaulay''s Speech Structure**\n\nExplain how the structure of Macaulay''s speech on the First Reform Bill reflects the principles of classical rhetoric discussed in this chapter.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the purpose of each section (introduction, proof, conclusion) and how they align with the ''arrangement'' principles mentioned in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Discuss how the organization of arguments (confirmation of his own views first, then refutation of objections) supports his goal of persuading the audience.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this structure to the ''rules of arrangement'' mentioned in the text, and explain how Macaulay''s choices demonstrate mastery of these principles.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s discussion on arrangement and demonstrate an understanding of how Macaulay''s strategy aligns with classical rhetorical principles.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Rhetorical Strategy in Persuasion**\n\nUsing the text''s discussion on arrangement and persuasion, analyze how Macaulay''s strategy of first confirming his own views before refuting objections is a logical and effective approach.\n- **Step 1**: Explain the purpose of presenting confirmation first in the context of persuasion.\n- **Step 2**: Justify why this order is more effective than addressing objections first.\n- **Step 3**: Reference the ''rules of arrangement'' from the text to support your reasoning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a deep understanding of rhetorical strategies and their application in persuasive speech.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning in Rhetorical Structure**\n\nExplain the logical reasoning behind Macaulay''s decision to structure his speech as follows: introduction, proof (with confirmation of views and refutation of objections), and conclusion.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the logical sequence that supports this structure in terms of persuasion.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the ''arrangement'' principles from the text guide this sequence.\n- **Step 3**: Reflect on how Macaulay''s choices reflect the ''rules of arrangement'' mentioned in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an ability to synthesize the text''s discussion on arrangement with Macaulay''s specific rhetorical choices.'

    A number of things are immediately apparent from this overview of the speech. First of all, it is notable how small a proportion of this long speech (about 9500 words) is devoted to the introduction and the conclusion. Secondly, one notes that there is no statement of fact. (We shall try to account for this proportion and this omission when we study the parts in detail.) Thirdly, one observes that Macaulay devotes the major portion of his speech (eighteen paragraphs) to the positive arguments in support of his stand.

    Now let us study the strategy of the several parts. As we observed earlier in this chapter, the introduction does one or both of two things—it informs and/or disposes an audience. In the first paragraph of this introduction, Macaulay explains why he feels obliged to challenge the Member for Finsbury: he must vindicate himself from the implied charge that he has promoted this education bill out of base motives. He is hinting here that if he can prove his case, he will, indirectly, remove the taint on his ethos. This is primarily a deliberative discourse, but because of the subsidiary purpose—exonering himself—it has overtones of judicial discourse. So the first paragraph was intended principally to dispose the audience favorably by exerting an ethical appeal.

    In the second paragraph of the introduction, Macaulay is doing two things: he explains why he cannot follow the order of his opponent's speech, and he is prejudicing the audience against his opponent. It would be a strategic mistake, Macaulay explains, to follow the order of his opponent's speech, because his opponent has avoided any discussion of the central issue in this matter: whether the State has any right or duty to interfere in the education of its citizens. If he were to avoid discussing this issue he could not exonerate himself or help the cause of his colleagues. By pointing out his opponent's avoidance of this central issue, Macaulay raises grave doubts in the minds of his hearers about the good sense and good will of his opponent. How could a man, seriously bent on forestalling the passage of the bill now before the House, avoid discussing the principle that is at the heart of the matter?

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Strategic Rhetorical Device Analysis\n\nIn the introduction of Macaulay''s speech, he uses a dual purpose: to inform and dispose of the audience. Analyze how Macaulay''s second paragraph employs a rhetorical strategy to both criticize his opponent and establish his own credibility.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the rhetorical strategy used in the second paragraph (e.g., ethos, pathos, logos).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how this strategy serves to prejudice the audience against his opponent.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how this strategy contributes to Macaulay''s overall goal of exonerating himself from the charge of base motives.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must be based solely on the text and demonstrate an understanding of classical rhetorical principles.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Logical Structure of a Deliberative Discourse\n\nMacaulay''s speech is primarily a deliberative discourse, but it contains elements of judicial reasoning. Explain how the first paragraph''s ethical appeal (ethos) supports his broader argumentative strategy.\n- **Step 1**: Define what a deliberative discourse is and how it differs from judicial reasoning.\n- **Step 2**: Identify specific elements in the first paragraph that serve as ethical appeals (ethos).\n- **Step 3**: Explain how these appeals contribute to the overall goal of vindicating Macaulay''s motives.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate an understanding of classical rhetoric and demonstrate how ethos functions within a deliberative context.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Rhetorical Strategy and Logical Reasoning\n\nMacaulay argues that his opponent''s avoidance of the central issue is a sign of bad sense and bad will. Construct a logical argument that supports this claim using the text''s description of Macaulay''s strategy.\n- **Step 1**: Restate the claim that avoiding the central issue indicates bad sense and bad will.\n- **Step 2**: Use the text''s description of Macaulay''s strategy to support this claim logically.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this reasoning aligns with classical rhetorical principles.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be structured to demonstrate logical coherence and an understanding of rhetorical strategy as outlined in the text.'

- prompt: |-
    The third paragraph of the introduction is a transitional paragraph in which Macaulay informs his audience of how he will proceed in the argumentative part of his discourse. He will set forth, unequivocally, how he himself stands on the basic issue and then give the reasons for the stand he takes. In other words, Macaulay has decided that the better strategy in this case is to present his case first and then proceed to refute the objections. As was observed earlier in this chapter, when one has confidence in the strength of one's case, it is usually better to present that case first. Once the audience has been exposed to the cogency of one's case, the audience will be inclined to recognize more readily the weakness of the opposing case when one proceeds to the refutation.

    Paragraph 4 marks Macaulay's entry into the argumentative part of the discourse. As we observed, this speech lacks the statement of fact, because in this instance there is no need to rehearse the state of the case. The members of the House know the facts; they have been discussing the matter for several days already. Macaulay is not going to risk boring his audience by laboring the obvious. He realizes that he must spend most of his time on the podium trying to sway any doubtful colleagues to his point of view.

    The first sentence of paragraph 4—"it is the right and the duty of the State to provide means of education for the common people"—is the conclusion that Macaulay hopes to establish in his speech. The major premise upon which this conclusion is based is stated at the end of this paragraph—"it is the duty of every government to take order for giving security to the persons and property of the members of the community." Since there is universal agreement about this function of government, Macaulay does not have to spend time proving the truth of this proposition. What he has to prove is the truth of his minor premise.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Argumentative Structure**\n\nBased on the text provided, explain how Macaulay''s argumentative strategy differs from a traditional Aristotelian approach to persuasion.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key components of Aristotle''s tripartite model (ethos, pathos, logos).\n- **Step 2**: Compare and contrast Macaulay''s approach to these elements with the description in the text.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why Macaulay''s method is more effective in the context of a parliamentary debate.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s description of Macaulay''s strategy and demonstrate an understanding of classical rhetorical theory.'

    This minor premise is presented in the first sentence of the next paragraph—‘"the education of the common people is a most effectual means of securing our persons and our property."' The rest of the confirmation portion of the speech is devoted to a series of arguments—arguments from example, from testimony, from analogy—to prove that educating the common people is the best means of "securing our persons and our property."

    We see then what great care Macaulay has taken to orient his audience at the outset of his speech. He exposes his ground-plan and makes it very clear what he is seeking to do. The human mind naturally delights in the perception of order of any kind, and when it is alerted at the outset to a plan, it is prepared to follow the working out of that plan. There will be times—especially when our case is weak or when an audience is unusually hostile—when it is better to conceal our plan until we are well launched into our argument. But since Macaulay has confidence in the strength of his case and since he knows that most of the members of the House concur with him, he decides to take advantage of what can be gained by "ordering" his discourse at the outset and thereby revealing his strategy.

    The first argument that Macaulay presents in paragraph 5 is an argument from testimony. And it is notable that the first authority he cites in support of his minor premise is Adam Smith. Adam Smith was a judicious choice, because after the publication of his Wealth of Nations (1776) he was generally regarded as the foremost champion of the free-enterprise system in political economy. Macaulay realizes that the people he has to convince are those who are fearful of government interference in the political, economic, and social affairs of men. What an advantage it will be to him if he can enlist in support of his contention the man who represents, for the unconvinced, the chief spokesman of the laissez-faire philosophy. Fortunately for his cause, Macaulay finds Adam Smith to be "an available means of persuasion" in this case, for Adam Smith had once contended that the education of the poor was the proper business of the Commonwealth.

- prompt: |-
    To demonstrate how wise Adam Smith's contention was, Macaulay cites examples, in the rest of paragraph 5 and in paragraph 6, of what happens when the Commonwealth does not take care for the education of the poor. There were No Popery riots led by Lord George Gordon in 1780, four years after Adam Smith made his unheeded recommendation, and there were subsequent riots in the industrial counties of the North.

    In paragraphs 4-7 Macaulay has set forth, briefly and cogently, his main argument, summarizing it in the form of a syllogism in paragraph 7. And as we have seen, it is strategically advisable to advance positive arguments and a strong argument first, when our case is strong. But if Macaulay now leaves unanswered the major objection to his main argument, there will linger in the minds of the opposing faction the suspicion that he has avoided the opposing argument because it is stronger than his own argument. So he must meet this opposing argument head on, and this he does in paragraphs 8-10.

    "And what is the alternative?" Macaulay asks at the beginning of paragraph 8. In meeting the opposing argument, he sets up an either-or situation. A government, he says, can protect persons and property either by educating the people or by putting people in prison. We can ignore the question of whether these are the only alternatives. Macaulay is merely taking advantage of the fact that the opposition has proposed punitive measures as the alternative to educating the people. In other words, since the opposition has not suggested other ways in which the government can fulfill its acknowledged duty to protect the lives and property of its citizens, Macaulay can deal exclusively with the alternative that the opposition has proposed.

    In paragraph 9, Macaulay cites the example of what happened in Monmouthshire to show that punitive measures are ineffectual in protecting the lives and property of the people. In the short paragraph 10, Macaulay generalizes from this single example: education of the people is not only a means but the best means of attaining the chief end of a government.

    In paragraph 11, Macaulay attempts to reinforce his generalization by presenting another example—the example of the Protestant Dissenters in Massachusetts. By citing this example, Macaulay again displays his great rhetorical skill. Most of the opposition to state-supported schools in England was coming from Dissenting groups—sects like the Puritans, Baptists, Independents, and Methodists. Macaulay realizes how impressive it will be if he cites the example of what the Puritans who emigrated to the New World did when they established their commonwealths. They immediately made provisions for the establishment of public schools in every township. Macaulay then cites the testimony of men like William Penn, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson—men who were wary of government interference—in support of his contention that it is prudent to educate the common people.

    In paragraphs 12-15, Macaulay returns to the opposing argument in a further attempt to refute it. His main efforts here are devoted to a highly emotional appeal, in paragraph 13, calculated to reduce to absurdity the view that "Government is simply a great hangman," and to his refutation, in paragraphs 14 and 15, of the analogical argument that if free competition is a good thing in business affairs, it must be a good thing in education.

    In paragraphs 16-19, Macaulay counters the argument he has just refuted, with an analogical argument of his own: just as government ought to provide for the national defense, so it ought to provide for the education of the people. He supports his own argument with an argument of David Hume—another Dissenter—who maintained that some vocations are necessary for the well-being of society but will not be undertaken unless there is adequate compensation offered. Since teaching is one of those vital vocations that private enterprise is not likely to compensate adequately, the government should assume the responsibility of rewarding the schoolmaster. Up to this point, however, the government has not supported public education, and the result has been mass illiteracy, a condition that is confirmed by statistics from various sources, which, Macaulay shrewdly reminds his audience, is the Congregational Union, a Nonconformist agency.

    Macaulay saves his most impressive example until last—the example of
    what state-supported education has accomplished in Scotland (paragraphs
    20-21). The reminder about the educational system in Scotland must have
    been particularly impressive to the Dissenters in Macaulay's audience, be-
    cause Scotland, with its national religion of Presbyterianism, was a strong-
    hold of the Nonconformist spirit. The example of Scotland was impressive
    for another reason too. By showing how Scotland, with far fewer physical
    and economic advantages, had outstripped England in the matter of ele-
    mentary education, Macaulay must have piqued the patriotic pride of Eng-
    lishmen.

    Paragraph 22 is a transitional paragraph, signaling the end of his argument
    for the principle enunciated at the beginning of paragraph 4 and preparing
    the audience for the next section of the speech—the refutation of the specific
    objections made by the Member for Finsbury. If there was any doubt about
    Macaulay's choosing to delay answering the objections until this point in
    the speech, the doubt would be cleared up by Macaulay's own statement in
    this paragraph. "For if the great principle for which I have been contending
    is admitted," Macaulay says here, "the objections which have been made to
    the details of our plan will vanish fast." Macaulay also reveals something
    about the arrangement of the following section: he will deal with the objec-
    tions in the order in which they were proposed in the amendment of the
    Member for Finsbury. Also, the audience can more easily check that he has
    answered all of the objections. He might have adopted another order—for
    instance, dealing with the most serious objection first, then going on to the
    next most serious—but by choosing to follow his opponent's order, he subtly
    discloses his confidence that he can easily demolish the objections—in what-
    ever order they come.

    In paragraphs 23-30, Macaulay states and refutes in turn each of the five
    objections leveled against the proposed bill:

    Objection to the interference with the religious convictions of the people
    (paragraphs 27-29)

    5. Objection to the interference with the civil rights of the people (paragraph 30)

    By the time Macaulay comes to his conclusion in paragraph 30, he has
    been haranguing his colleagues for at least an hour. He could now launch
    into a peroration that would briefly recapitulate his arguments, reinforce
    his ethical appeal, and rouse his audience to the proper emotional pitch.
    Instead, he concludes his speech with three sentences (gg words) of succes-
    sively greater length.

    Macaulay must have sensed that nothing more was to be gained, with this
    particular audience, by prolonging his speech. By this time, the audience has
    been subjected to so much debate on this matter that they will be grateful
    to the orator who sits down when he has made his point. These members
    of the House of Commons, who are being asked to appropriate a large sum
    of money, are hardheaded, practical men answerable to their constituents.

    appeal. They are going to be impressed by arguments which prove, or at
    least persuade them, that this measure is worthy, advantageous, or feasible.
    So Macaulay contents himself in the conclusion with a brief appeal: a re-
    minder that the members of the House are accountable (1) to all the citizens
    of the country, and (2) to future generations. That reminder will prompt
    his audience to weigh the moral importance of their forthcoming vote.

    This is an essay by a well-known educator and professional writer on another
    problem connected with education. Robert M. Hutchins, former Chancellor
    of the University of Chicago and now President of the Fund for the Republic
    (a Ford Foundation agency ), originally delivered this discourse as the Bedell
    Lecture at Kenyon College in October 1948, but later adapted the speech for
    inclusion in a collection of his essays entitled Freedom, Education, and the
    Fund: Essays and Addresses, 1946-1956 (New York: Meridian Books, 1956),
    pp. 81-100. Reprinted by permission of the author.

    1 This essay is an inquiry into problems that are among the hardest in
    education. I cannot pretend that I have solved any of them. The inquiry
    will take us through some of the solutions that have been offered. If in the
    process it appears that these solutions are inadequate, I beg the reader not
    to despair; for it may be possible to discover solutions that may be workable
    and sound. I believe that higher education can make a unique contribution
    to morals and religion. I do not believe that it can make some of the contri-
    butions expected of it, and I think that these expectations obscure the real
    purposes and achievements of higher education. The object of this essay
    must therefore be rather more to clear the ground than to erect a building.
    I can regard the building attempted here as at best a very modest structure,
    which will accomplish more than I am entitled to hope for it if it serves as
    temporary shelter to those who may design the ultimate edifice.

    2 The essay uses the words "morals," "religion," and "higher education"
    in a definite sense. The sense may be wrong, but it is consistently employed.
    By morals I mean good habits. Good habits are those which are good for
    the organism in question. To know what is good for an organism, you have
    to know the nature of that organism. If man is an animal like any other,
    then there is no reason why we should expect him to have habits any differ-
    ent from the other animals. For by good habits we do not mean obedience
    to conventions. That lies in the sphere of etiquette, rather than morals, and
    we are concerned here with morals.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nExplain how the concept of ''good habits'' as defined in the text relates to the purpose of education. Use examples from the essay to support your argument, and consider how this definition contrasts with common notions of morals.\n- **Step 1**: Define ''good habits'' based on the text''s explanation.\n- **Step 2**: Cite a specific example from the essay (e.g., the Kinsey Report) that illustrates the lack of moral significance in this context.\n- **Step 3**: Contrast the text''s definition with traditional views of morals, and explain how education can cultivate good habits through its structure and content.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly define the term ''good habits'' and demonstrate an understanding of how education serves as a medium for habit formation.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Analysis of Educational Expectations**\n\nThe essay argues that higher education''s role in morals and religion is overstated. Use the text to explain why these expectations might be misplaced, and propose an alternative function for higher education.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the main argument against higher education''s contribution to morals and religion.\n- **Step 2**: Reference the text''s discussion on the ''object of this essay'' to justify the need for clarification rather than direct solutions.\n- **Step 3**: Suggest an alternative purpose for higher education, ensuring it aligns with the text''s emphasis on ''temporary shelter'' for future developments.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reflect the text''s critique of educational expectations and propose a coherent alternative function for higher education.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Rhetorical Principles**\n\nUsing the text''s definition of ''good habits,'' construct a hypothetical scenario where education is designed to instill specific good habits.\n- **Step 1**: Choose a set of good habits that align with the text''s definition (e.g., discipline, responsibility).\n- **Step 2**: Describe the educational structure and content that would foster these habits.\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate how this approach fulfills the text''s assertion that ''higher education can make a unique contribution to morals.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your scenario must be logically consistent with the text''s principles and demonstrate a clear connection between education, habit formation, and moral development.'

    It seems to proceed on the assumption that, since man is an animal like any other, and since morals are purely conventional, a moral revolution may be effected by showing that we do not live according to the conventions we profess. To show that men do not live according to the conventions they profess merely shows that they do not live according to the conventions they profess. It shows nothing at all about what is good for man or what is bad for him. The fact that a great many men may be doing what is bad for them is neither new nor relevant. A man may change a convention by getting the leaders of society to join him in breaking it. A man cannot change bad to good even if he gets all his fellow-men to conspire with him.

    4 By religion I mean belief in and obedience to God. This may not require adherence to a church or creed; but it demands religious faith. Faith is not reason, but it is something more than a vague, sentimental desire to do good and be good. The problem of faith and reason has agitated mankind for centuries, and I could not deal with it here, even if I knew how. But the kind of religion I am talking about is one that is sustained by both reason and faith. We see in St. Augustine's Confessions the way in which a man may come to the sort of religious conviction that has meaning. St. Augustine's conversion followed after tremendous wrestling with the intellectual difficulties of Christianity and was prepared by the conquest of those difficulties.

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Analyzing the Concept of Morality and Convention\n\nThe text suggests that a moral revolution can be achieved by showing that people do not live according to the conventions they profess. However, it also states that this does not necessarily show what is good or bad for man.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the text argues that demonstrating a lack of conformity to moral conventions does not determine what is morally good or bad. Use the text''s reasoning about the nature of morals and conventions.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument that supports the text''s claim that changing moral conventions through societal pressure is not sufficient to improve human well-being. Reference the text''s statement about the irrelevance of ''a great many men may be doing what is bad for them.''\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the text''s assertion that ''a man cannot change bad to good even if he gets all his fellow-men to conspire with him.'' Use the text''s distinction between moral conventions and what is good for man.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must draw directly from the text''s reasoning about morality, conventions, and human well-being without referencing external sources.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Exploring the Nature of Religion and Faith\n\nThe text defines religion as belief in and obedience to God, emphasizing the role of both reason and faith. It references St. Augustine''s experience as an example of how religious conviction can be formed through intellectual struggle and faith.\n- **Part A**: Explain the text''s definition of religion and its distinction from mere belief in a church or creed. Use the quote: ''Faith is not reason, but it is something more than a vague, sentimental desire to do good and be good.''\n- **Part B**: Analyze St. Augustine''s conversion as an example of how faith and reason interact in the formation of religious conviction. Reference the text''s mention of ''tremendous wrestling with the intellectual difficulties of Christianity.''\n- **Part C**: Argue whether the text supports the idea that religion must be ''sustained by both reason and faith.'' Use the text''s claim that ''the kind of religion I am talking about is one that is sustained by both reason and faith.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of religion, faith, and reason without external references.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Synthesizing Moral and Religious Reasoning\n\nThe text presents a contrast between moral conventions and religious faith, suggesting that morality is conventional while religion involves both reason and faith.\n- **Part A**: Compare the text''s view of morality as purely conventional with its portrayal of religion as requiring both reason and faith. Use the text''s statements about ''morals are purely conventional'' and ''religion is sustained by both reason and faith.''\n- **Part B**: Evaluate the text''s argument that ''a man cannot change bad to good even if he gets all his fellow-men to conspire with him.'' How does this relate to the text''s broader discussion of moral conventions and religious conviction?\n- **Part C**: Construct a logical argument that ties the text''s ideas about moral conventions and religious faith together. Use the text''s distinction between what is good for man and what is bad for him, as well as its emphasis on faith being ''something more than a vague, sentimental desire to do good.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must synthesize the text''s moral and religious arguments without referencing external sources.'

    5 By higher education I mean that education which takes place in institutions beyond the secondary level as secondary education is usually defined.
    I mean the education that is given by the colleges and universities of this
    country. I do not believe that these institutions are properly organized. The
    college should occupy the area now uneasily filled by the last two years of
    high school and the first two years of college, and the university should begin
    its work at the beginning of the conventional junior year in college. But
    for the purposes of this essay I am willing to regard all the colleges of the
    United States as offering higher education. I am willing to include all
    universities, too, even though I believe that a university is a place where all
    professors and all students are engaged in independent study, and in this
    view a true university has not yet arisen in our country.

    6 We are concerned, then, with what goes on or with what should go on
    in certain institutions, in institutions of a certain kind. And it is important
    to notice that what goes on or should go on in these institutions is severely
    limited to what can go on in them. What can go on in them is in part
    determined by the age of the students with whom they have to deal and by
    the length of time that they spend in the institutions. At any university, if
    an alumnus "succeeds" in later life, it is customary for the university to take
    the credit for it; if he goes to the penitentiary, it is said that he was bad
    material and should never have been admitted. President Truman's Com-
    mission on Higher Education sees the student going to college in the moral
    and intellectual state of the newborn babe and graduating four, or even two,
    years later as a mature and autonomous member of society. The Commission,
    like most people who know far less about education, places on the educa-
    tional institution a responsibility for the total development of the individual
    by starting and ending with the wrong assumptions.

    7 The assumption that a college freshman has no habits is in obvious contradiction to the facts of life. The assumption that if he has no habits, or, if his habits are all bad, he can acquire in four years a set of good habits that will last all his life is certainly naive. My guess is that eighteen is a greater age than we who are past it are willing to admit. It is flattering to us, and it makes our work easier, to feel that our students are children who can do nothing and learn little without our help and supervision; but to suppose that a boy or girl of eighteen has been unaffected by his home and by society is not merely factually inaccurate; it gives higher education a false conception of its task and its possibilities; and it must contribute to that prolongation of adolescence which is so distressing a feature of American life.

    8. We are concerned here, then, with what certain institutions can do in a certain period of time with certain people of a certain age.' And in each institution there will be a certain number of these young people, and usually a number larger than one per instructor. Rousseau's Emile contains some interesting educational suggestions, but it can help us in the solution of few of the practical problems that affect an educational system: Emile had a tutor and never went to school." We are discussing what can be done in scholastic institutions at a certain level.

    9 John Stuart Mill faced this question in his inaugural address at St. Andrews. He said: "No one can dispense with an education directed expressly to the moral as well as the intellectual part of his being. Such education, so far as it is direct, is either moral or religious; and these may either be treated as distinct or as different aspects of the same thing. The subject we are now considering is not education as a whole, but scholastic education, and we must keep in view the inevitable limitations of what schools and universities can do. It is beyond their power to educate morally or religiously. Moral and religious education consist in training the feelings and the daily habits; and these are, in the main, beyond the sphere and inaccessible to the 1 "We must remember that the whole problem of intellectual education is controlled by

    The control of public education. It is the home, the family, which gives us the moral or religious education we really receive; and this is completed, and modified, sometimes for the better, often for the worse, by society and the opinions and feelings with which we are there surrounded."

    10 So Cardinal Newman insisted over and over again that the purpose of a university was intellectual and not moral. The utilitarian philosopher and the Catholic theologian came to the same conclusion, though perhaps for different reasons. To the role of the family Newman adds that of the church, which, characteristically, Mill does not mention in his discussion of moral and religious education. They both hold that it is beyond the power of higher education to educate morally and religiously. Both Newman and Mill view the world about them as containing various agencies and institutions, each with a purpose of its own. The sphere of the family or the church is not the sphere of educational institutions; the sphere of educational institutions is not that of the family or the church.

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Analyzing the Role of Education in Moral Development\n\nBased on the passage, compare and contrast Newman''s and Mill''s views on the role of higher education in moral and religious development.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key assertion made by each author regarding the limitations of higher education.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how their perspectives reflect broader philosophical differences (e.g., utilitarianism vs. Catholic theology).\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the passage concludes that educational institutions have a distinct sphere from family and religious institutions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the passage''s text and demonstrate an understanding of both authors'' positions without external knowledge.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Evaluating the Influence of Family and Society on Education\n\nThe passage emphasizes that moral and religious education is primarily the responsibility of the family and society. Construct an argument addressing the following:\n- **Part A**: Why does the passage argue that society''s influence on education is indirect and often unpredictable?\n- **Part B**: How does the author use the contrast between family and educational institutions to highlight the limitations of formal education?\n- **Part C**: Propose a solution that would complement formal education while respecting the passage''s emphasis on the autonomy of different societal institutions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the passage''s ideas about the roles of various institutions and demonstrate critical reasoning based on the text alone.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Interpreting the Concept of Educational Spheres\n\nThe passage defines distinct spheres for family, church, and educational institutions. Analyze the implications of this division:\n- **Part A**: Explain how the passage''s view of educational institutions as separate from family and church challenges the notion that education is a comprehensive moral and religious force.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the potential consequences of this division on the development of a well-rounded individual.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on whether this perspective supports or undermines the idea that education should have a broader societal role. Support your conclusion with reasoning based on the passage''s arguments.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly engage with the text''s central argument and demonstrate an ability to synthesize its key ideas without external references.'

    xz Mill and Newman were writing in the nineteenth century, when both
    church and family were more effective in their spheres than they are today.
    Would their conclusion be any different now, when, we are told, the family
    is disintegrating and the church is dying? I think not. Even if they assumed
    that the family was going to pieces and the church on the way to extinction,
    Newman and Mill would hardly suppose that the way to revive these insti-
    tutions was to turn over their functions to another agency. This could only
    guarantee the destruction of the family and the church. And, if the attempt
    were made to turn their functions over to the educational system, it would
    guarantee the increasing confusion of that agency. If we can find out what
    the proper function of the education system is, we shall discover at the
    same time, I am sure, that the performance of that function will require
    all the attention and intelligence that the educational system can command.
    12 Mill emphasizes another point: some phases of human development are
    determined by the impact of society in adult life. In our time the impact of
    society, particularly as it makes itself felt through what are called the media
    of mass communication, of which Mill and Newman were fortunately ig-
    norant, is, I think, the most important factor in moral and cultural develop-
    ment. I do not see how any educational system can be expected to cope with
    the comic book, the radio, the motion picture, the slick-paper magazine,
    television, and the sensational press. The tremendous skill and the enormous
    resources available to these moral and cultural agencies make them more
    influential in molding the lives of our people than the whole educational
    system. And even if the educational system had more money and more
    skill, as it certainly should have, there appears to be a kind of Gresham's
    law of culture, under which bad stuff drives out good. Probably because of
    original sin, human beings seem to prefer demoralization to improvement.

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Analysis of Mill and Newman''s Institutional Perspective\n\nGiven that Mill and Newman believed in the distinct roles of family, church, and education, evaluate how their views would apply to contemporary issues regarding the influence of mass media on moral development.\n- **Part A**: Explain why Mill and Newman would argue that educational systems cannot effectively counteract the influence of mass media. Use specific examples from the text (e.g., "the comic book, the radio,").\n- **Part B**: Justify why their conclusion about the "Gresham''s law of culture" remains relevant today, considering the prevalence of online content and social media.\n- **Part C**: Propose an alternative to the current reliance on educational systems for moral development, based on Mill and Newman''s understanding of societal impact.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the original text''s argument and its applicability to modern contexts without referencing external material.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Synthesis of Educational Function and Societal Influence\n\nIf Mill and Newman were to revisit their conclusions about the role of education in society, what changes would they likely advocate for?\n- **Part A**: Describe how their view of the educational system''s function would differ from modern interpretations. Use examples from the text, such as "the tremendous skill and resources available to moral and cultural agencies.").\n- **Part B**: Propose a strategy for education to maintain its influence in the face of mass media''s dominance, incorporating their idea of "Gresham''s law of culture."\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the feasibility of their proposed strategy in today''s digital landscape, considering factors like access to technology and the speed of information dissemination.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate Mill and Newman''s original argument with modern societal challenges, demonstrating critical reasoning about the role of education in a media-saturated world.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Critical Reasoning on Moral Development and Cultural Influence\n\nBased on the text''s discussion of original sin and the preference for demoralization, construct an argument about the role of institutions in shaping societal values.\n- **Part A**: Explain how Mill and Newman''s concept of "original sin" relates to the current crisis in moral development, particularly with the rise of digital media.\n- **Part B**: Argue why the educational system''s inability to compete with mass media is a fundamental flaw in their proposed model of societal influence.\n- **Part C**: Suggest a solution that addresses this flaw while maintaining the core principles of Mill and Newman''s institutional framework.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reflect a deep understanding of the text''s philosophical underpinnings and apply them to contemporary issues without external references.'

    13 The usual answer to this is that we shall educate human beings to be better and to prefer to be better than worse. This seems to me to overlook the limited time that the educational system has at its disposal and the limited influence that it can therefore have upon the lives of those who, even while they are temporarily committed to its care, are soaking up through every pore poisons transmitted by every device that the triumphs of science and technology now make it possible to subject them to.

    14 An officer of the General Electric Company has lately commented on cultural benefits conferred upon us by television. He said that the principal market for television sets was saloons and that therefore the contribution of this triumph of science and technology to the advance of civilization was more booze, less fresh air, and the same old ball game.

    15 In A Study of History Mr. Toynbee deals at length with the stumbling blocks that have prevented universal free education from ushering in a new era of happiness and well-being for Western society. The dangerous consequence of the introduction of universal free education in Great Britain in 1870, Toynbee argues, was the triumph of yellow journalism—and later the movies—which succeeded in creating an intellectual tyranny more deadening than the illiteracy from which free schooling had rescued the masses.° The only remedy to this situation, Toynbee continues, is to raise the level of mass cultivation.*

    16 We must heartily agree with Mr. Toynbee that it is desirable to raise the level of mass cultivation. From the point of view of Mr. Toynbee's aims, universal liberal education, rather than universal schooling, is indicated. But to hope that even the best training in criticism can cope with the constant storm of triviality and propaganda that now beats upon the citizen seems to me to expect too much of any educational system. Such training should certainly be given, and given to everybody. But an educational system cannot reform a society, and Mr. Toynbee is calling for nothing less.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Educational Philosophy**\n\nGiven the text''s discussion on universal free education and its consequences, synthesize a philosophical argument for or against the effectiveness of educational systems in cultivating critical thinking.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key philosophical claims from Toynbee''s perspective (e.g., the triumph of yellow journalism, the role of mass cultivation).\n- **Step 2**: Compare these claims to the officer''s argument about television and its cultural impact.\n- **Step 3**: Construct a conclusion that aligns with the text''s central thesis: can educational systems truly counteract the influence of mass media and propaganda?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must explicitly reference both Toynbee''s concerns and the officer''s analogy, and your conclusion must reflect the text''s suggestion that educational systems have limited influence over societal transformation.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Educational Systems**\n\nEvaluate the text''s argument that "an educational system cannot reform a society." Use specific examples from the passage to support your analysis.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two distinct instances where the text suggests that education has failed to transform society (e.g., yellow journalism, television''s role in saloons).\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how these examples illustrate the limited influence of education on societal change.\n- **Step 3**: Reflect on the implications of this argument for modern educational systems, considering both the text''s warnings and its call for "mass cultivation."\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate at least two textual examples and clearly link them to the central claim that education alone is insufficient for societal reform.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Educational Outcomes**\n\nThe text contrasts the goals of universal schooling with those of universal liberal education. Construct a logical argument that explains why, according to the text, liberal education is more effective in cultivating critical thinking than standardized schooling.\n- **Step 1**: Define the key difference between universal liberal education and standardized schooling as presented in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Use Toynbee''s argument about yellow journalism and the triumph of mass media to support your reasoning.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a comparison of the two educational approaches in terms of their capacity to foster critical thinking and societal improvement.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must explicitly reference Toynbee''s concerns and demonstrate how liberal education addresses the limitations of standardized schooling as outlined in the text.'

    17 I can pursue this subject no further, for that way madness lies. I can
    only assume that the educational system will continue to do its best in the
    hope that some day a sort of mass conversion will overtake our people, and
    they will want to be better. If they do not want to be better, the educational
    system cannot make them so. And the educational system cannot make them
    want to be so. All it can do is to offer an opportunity and, perhaps, an

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Analyzing the Role of Education in Society\n\nBased on the passage, explain how education serves as both an opportunity and a challenge in shaping societal values. Use specific references from the text to support your argument, including the idea that education "cannot make them want to be better" but can provide "an opportunity and perhaps an example."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the text''s central thesis about education''s limitations and its potential to influence societal change through opportunity.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Evaluating the Impact of Educational Reform\n\nThe passage mentions that the spread of free compulsory education has historically been followed by an increase in "the power of ruling oligarchies at the expense of the masses." How does this statement reflect a logical contradiction in the role of education?\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain the contradiction between education''s goal of empowerment and its potential to reinforce existing power structures.\n- **Part B**: Use the text''s reference to Huxley''s "cheapening and acceleration of the older methods of printing" to draw a parallel between educational reform and technological advancement.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s argument about education''s dual role in society.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Synthesizing Historical and Philosophical Perspectives\n\nThe passage references Aldous Huxley''s view that education can lead to the "cheapening and acceleration of the older methods of printing." How does this relate to the philosophical stance in the text that "the educational system cannot make them want to be better"?\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Compare and contrast the two perspectives on education''s impact.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument that synthesizes these ideas into a broader philosophical statement about the nature of education and societal change.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both references and present a cohesive argument based on the text''s themes.'

    18 Let us return to Newman and Mill. They do not say that moral and
    religious education is unimportant. On the contrary, they both feel that
    moral and religious education is more important than intellectual education.
    So do I. The question is not whether moral and religious education is impor-
    tant, but what colleges and universities can do about it. No one would favor a
    nation of highly intelligent and well-trained robbers, murderers, thieves,
    arsonists, and forgers. And no one would contend that knowledge of the
    arts and sciences automatically leads to the development of good moral habits.
    19 Aristotle said that it is impossible to be wise without being good, and
    impossible to be good without being wise. But this cannot be taken to mean
    that it is impossible to be good without qualifying for the Ph.D. degree. We
    all know good scholars who are bad men; and I have known some illiterates
    who seemed good to me. Aristotle meant that it is impossible to be good
    without being prudent, or practically wise, because the imprudent man does
    not know how to adjust means to ends; and it is impossible to be prudent,
    or practically wise, without being good, because the bad man is seeking the
    wrong ends. Though prudence is a habit of the mind, it seems to me that
    habit of the mind which higher education is least qualified and least likely
    to teach. The development of prudence requires long experience and reflec-
    tion. Aristotle said that young men should not listen to lectures on moral
    philosophy, because they have had no experience; they would have only the
    vaguest and most abstract notions of what was under discussion. As I indi-
    cated earlier, college and university students are likely to be more mature
    than we think they are. They are not blank tablets upon which the teacher
    can write anything he pleases. They have habits, and many, if not most,
    of them have learned something of religion. But by saying that they are
    more mature than we think they are I do not mean to say they are mature.
    They are not experienced adults. It is hard to disagree with Aristotle's prin-
    ciple that subjects that require experience do not convey their full meaning
    to the inexperienced.

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Moral and Intellectual Education\n\nGiven the text''s argument that moral education is more important than intellectual education, but that higher education must balance both, explain how colleges and universities can fulfill this dual responsibility.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key claims made by Newman and Mill regarding moral education''s priority.\n- **Step 2**: Reference Aristotle''s view on the relationship between wisdom and virtue.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a practical strategy for integrating moral education into university curricula while respecting the text''s emphasis on prudence as a habit requiring experience.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly address both the necessity of moral education and the limitations of higher education in fostering prudence, as outlined in the text.'

Evaluate this claim using the text''s definition of prudence as "a habit of the mind" that requires experience.\n- **Step 1**: Define prudence according to the text and explain its relationship to moral character.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze whether the text supports the idea that prudence is inherently tied to goodness.\n- **Step 3**: Consider the implications of Aristotle''s assertion that young men should not study moral philosophy without experience.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s philosophical arguments and their connection to the concept of prudence in education.'

Using this claim, construct a rhetorical argument for the importance of moral education in higher education.\n- **Step 1**: Reference the text''s discussion on prudence as a habit requiring experience.\n- **Step 2**: Use the example of students who have "learned something of religion" to support your argument.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a statement that aligns with the text''s emphasis on balancing intellectual and moral education.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be structured as a coherent rhetorical statement that reflects the text''s core thesis on education and maturity.'

    20 For this reason we may lament the low estate of the education of adults
    in this country. Moral and political philosophy, history, and literature yield
    up their full lessons only to those who have had the experience to compre-
    hend them. If they are taught to the inexperienced and never taught again,
    they are never comprehended. A boy will read a few plays of Shakespeare
    in high school and never look at them for the rest of his life. Shakespeare
    remains for him a quaint ancient writer who did not know how to spell
    very well, but who has managed to leave us a large number of quotations
    for funeral orations and Fourth of July addresses. This does not mean that
    342 ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL

    Shakespeare should not be taught in high school. It means that if he is read
    only in high school, we never get more than a fraction of what he has to
    give us. My favorite illustration is Macbeth. When I taught Macbeth to
    students in a preparatory school, it was a blood-and-thunder story. It was
    a good blood-and-thunder story, and one well worth teaching; but it was
    a blood-and-thunder story still. Macbeth can mean to us what it meant to
    Shakespeare only if we have had enough experience, vicarious or otherwise,
    of marriage and ambition to understand the issues and their implications.
    21 These considerations suggest that the curriculum in our schools and col-
    leges is upside down. It is assumed that children are primarily interested in
    the life about them and that subjects dealing with the life about them com-
    mand their attention and enlist their understanding; hence the increasing
    prominence of the social studies in the schools. Nothing in my experience
    suggests that children are more interested in American history than in
    arithmetic and the stories of ancient Greece. Those subjects which are com-
    monly supposed to be too abstract for the young, like mathematics, grammar,
    logic, astronomy, and music, are the best subjects for the young precisely
    because they are abstract. Their comprehension requires no experience or
    maturity. I see no escape from the proposition that subjects that require
    experience and maturity cannot be profitably taught to the inexperienced and
    immature.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Educational Philosophy**\n\nUsing the text''s argument about the role of experience in learning, construct a three-part response explaining why Shakespeare should be taught in high school.\n- **Part A**: Reference the author''s claim that ''if they are taught to the inexperienced and never taught again, they are never comprehended.''\n- **Part B**: Explain how teaching Shakespeare in high school, rather than college, aligns with the author''s view that ''subjects requiring experience and maturity cannot be profitably taught to the inexperienced and immature.''\n- **Part C**: Propose a pedagogical approach that integrates ''vicarious experience'' to help students comprehend complex texts like *Macbeth*, citing the author''s example of how ''vicarious experience'' is essential for understanding.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference at least three key ideas from the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of the author''s educational philosophy.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Curriculum Priorities**\n\nThe text argues that subjects like mathematics, grammar, and logic are best suited for young students because they do not require experience or maturity. In contrast, social studies and literature are deemed ''too abstract'' for the young but are now given more emphasis in schools.\n- **Part A**: Using the text, explain why the author believes that ''the curriculum in our schools and colleges is upside down.''\n- **Part B**: Compare the author''s view on the ''abstract'' nature of mathematics to their perspective on social studies.\n- **Part C**: Suggest a balanced curriculum that incorporates both ''abstract'' subjects and those requiring experience, citing the author''s assertion that ''subjects that require experience and maturity cannot be profitably taught to the inexperienced and immature.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate at least two key arguments from the text and provide a coherent analysis of curriculum design based on the author''s philosophy.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Educational Principles to Real-World Scenarios**\n\nThe author discusses the importance of ''vicarious experience'' in understanding complex texts like *Macbeth*. Apply this principle to a real-world scenario involving a different subject.\n- **Part A**: Choose a subject that requires ''experience'' (e.g., history, science) and explain how vicarious experience can aid learning.\n- **Part B**: Contrast this with a subject that is ''abstract'' (e.g., mathematics, logic) and explain why vicarious experience may not be as necessary.\n- **Part C**: Based on the author''s argument, design a learning activity that combines ''vicarious experience'' with direct instruction for an abstract subject.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the author''s concept of vicarious experience and apply it to two different subject areas, showing how the principles from the text can be used in educational practice.'

    22 At any rate it seems to me that higher education probably cannot teach
    prudence or practical wisdom, that habit of the mind by which we select
    the right means to the end. Nor can it, I believe, teach good habits of action.
    It cannot teach morals.

    23 The moral virtues are habits, and habits are formed by acts. We can
    have no assurance that courses in elementary, intermediate, and advanced
    goodness will be followed by good acts. In fact, such courses seem likely
    to induce precisely the opposite behavior. The boarding school in the country,
    and to some extent the college in a small town, may be able to prevent its
    students from the habitual performance of acts so bad that they violate the
    law or outrage the conventions. But even this opportunity is denied the
    metropolitan university, half the students of which live at home, far from
    the benevolent influence of the dean of men and the dean of women. In any
    event this kind of control must be of the most superficial and negative order.
    It will not do to say that higher education should try to prevent crime. What
    we are seeking to discover is the means by which higher education can pro:
    mote the formation of good habits; it can hardly hope to do so by courses
    in how to be good.

    24 Nor can it hope to do so by means of extra-curricular activities, at least
    on that industrial or "big-time" scale with which we in America are familiar.

    Go through the discipline and sometimes suffer the fate of the gladiators of old while the rest of the college observes their conduct on Saturday afternoons in the spirit of a Roman holiday. I confess I am unable to see what this has to do with morals, religion, or higher education, except as to the experts referred to. They indeed may develop some habits, and some of the habits may be good. The four cardinal virtues are traditionally supposed to be courage, temperance, justice, and prudence; and the athlete may be compelled, in so far as he is an athlete, to give some appearance of them all.

    25 The courage that is required to meet the shock of a 225-pound steel-worker imported from Gary, and the temperance required at the training table, and the justice required to obey the rules, and the prudence required to select the right means to the end of victory doubtless bear some relation to the courage, temperance, justice, and prudence that moralists had in mind when they isolated and described the cardinal virtues. But the effect of the activities of the experts on the moral character of the rest of the college must be slight at best. My class never saw Yale win a big game, and it was said of the coach of that time that he had conferred one inestimable moral benefit upon the student body: he had taught them not to bet—or at least not to bet on Yale. I do not depreciate this contribution; for temperance and prudence would seem to forbid gambling. But this contribution, important as it is, seems to me negligible in contrast to the enormous expenditure of time, money, effort, and interest that went into the acquisition of it.

    26 Even if extra-curricular activities had the decisively beneficial influence on character that their devotees claim for them, that would hardly help us to answer the question of the special role of higher education in the formation of character; for extra-curricular activities could be conducted more effectively if there were no curriculum at all. They could be and are conducted in YMCA's or Boy Scout encampments, at country clubs and among the Campfire Girls. Extra-curricular activities are not the peculiar property of educational institutions, nor do they serve to clarify the peculiar part that educational institutions can play in the formation of character.

    27 Higher education cannot hope to make students good by compulsory religious exercises. If a college or university has decided to be secular, in the sense that it requires no religious tests of its students or faculty, if it wants to appeal to those of no faith, of little faith, and many faiths, it cannot compel worship. It may compel attendance; my classmates came to morning chapel with overcoats over their pajamas and coughed the speaker down.

    * There is some reason to believe that this is the group Milton had in mind when he referred to

    "...Eli's sons, who fill'd
    With lust and violence the house of God."

    (Paradise Lost, Bk. I, line 495).

    344 ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL

    After five years of coughing, compulsory chapel was abolished. There was moaning among some of the trustees, alumni, and faculty; but a college cannot have it both ways. It cannot hold itself out as secular and then demand that its members go through religious ceremonies as a condition of being allowed to continue as members.

    28 The great majority of the endowed colleges and universities of this country have long since passed from under the control of the religious groups that founded them; and public institutions seem required by the Constitution to be secular. Yet it must be admitted that religion is of the greatest moral importance. If the whole world practiced Aristotle's Ethics, the whole world would be much better off than it is today. But I doubt if any single man, to say nothing of the whole world, can practice Aristotle's Ethics without the support and inspiration of religious faith. This Aristotle himself seemed to recognize; for the ideal man whom he holds up to our admiration is one who is almost divine. The modern critic is inclined to scoff at the Aristotelian dictum that men are rational animals. It is no longer fashionable to refer to the rationality of man. But Aristotle was saying not merely that men are rational but also that they are animal.® Because men are animal, because the flesh is weak and life is hard, the moral virtues cannot be consistently practiced without divine aid.

    29 Metaphysics and what is called natural theology deal with the ultimate questions. But intellectual history reveals nothing so clearly as their inadequacy for the task. The existence and nature of God, the character and destiny of the human soul, and the salvation of man are problems that remain obscure in the light of natural reason. Or consider human life without religion and history without providence. A perfect theory of democracy can be made out of the metaphysical and ethical writings of Aristotle. But as he himself did not have the fortitude to follow his premises to their conclusions and admit all men to participation in their own government, so it is improbable that the practice of democracy now or in the future can be achieved merely by the demonstration of its reasonableness. Men, simply because they are men, are unlikely to find within themselves the power that can bring the good life and the good state to pass. As Reinhold Niebuhr pointed out in his Gifford lectures, all anthropocentric ethical doctrines fail at this point: they overlook the fallen nature of man and assume that without grace he can reach a terrestrial end to which, almost by definition, no being with such a nature can ever attain.

    30 No one could have been more conscious of the dependence of morals upon religion than Cardinal Newman, and it was he who said that the purpose of a university was intellectual, not moral. Our question is not whether the educational system can give us everything that is indispensable to the good life. If a college cannot make its students religious, it cannot, to that extent, make them good.

    31 Why cannot higher education make its students religious? Why can it not exact a religious commitment from all entering students and apply religious tests determining or affecting their progress through, and graduation from, the institution? Why can it not insist that all members of the faculty shall be members in good standing of Christian churches and shall perform their religious duties with the same regularity and obligation as they now perform their teaching duties?

    32 Perhaps a college could do these things, but it would be unfortunate if it did. Faith is one of the theological virtues; it may be deserved, but it is not earned. It is a gift of God. Those who have been denied this gift should not be denied educational opportunities.

    33 As to the professors, let us imagine that the college or university has a choice between a man who is a third-rate historian or physicist but an ardent believer and one who is a first-rate historian or physicist and an atheist? Which should it choose? I approach this question with some diffidence, for I am not at all sure of the answer. John Stuart Mill had an answer. He said:
    "The moral or religious influence which a university can exercise consists less in any express teaching than in the pervading tone of the place. Whatever it teaches, it should teach as penetrated by a sense of duty; it should present all knowledge as chiefly a means to worthiness of life, given for the double purpose of making each of us practically useful to his fellow-creatures and of elevating the character of the species itself; exalting and dignifying our nature."

- prompt: "34 Mill says that the moral and religious influence of a university consists  \nin its pervading tone. If the pervading tone is moral and religious, moral  \nand religious influence will follow. But how is the pervading tone set? The  \npervading tone of higher education must be set by those who guide its  \ndestinies and teach its students. If they are moral and religious, the tone  \nmay be that which Mill would like to hear. If they are not, the tone may be  \nsomething else altogether.\n\n35 Since we are agreed that it is more important to be good than to be  \nintellectual and that it is hard, if not impossible, to be good without being  \nreligious, and since we want higher education to exert a moral and religious  \ninfluence through its pervading tone, it would seem to follow that men  \nshould not be appointed to the faculties of colleges and universities unless  \nthey are moral and religious men. Yet we know that every day men are  \nappointed to faculties after a most painstaking investigation of their intel-  \nlectual attainments but without any inquiry into their moral habits or their  \nreligious beliefs. I do it every day myself. We do not ask whether the pro-  \nspective appointee is afflicted with scientism, skepticism, or secularism. We  \ndo not request him to state whether he believes in God or whether or not  \nhe thinks morals are indistinguishable from the mores and are relative, like  \nthe mores, to time and place. We ask what his training has been, what his  \nrecord was, what his publications are, and what are the prospects of his  \npublishing any more. We ask, in short, whether he has discovered any truths  \nin his specialty and whether he can be expected to seek for and, perhaps,  \ndiscover additional truths. It would be regarded as an impertinence in a  \nsecular institution to ask a prospective faculty member about anything out-  \nside his specialty, unless, of course, rumors of flagrant immorality likely to  \nembarrass the college had reached the president's ears.

    36 It is perfectly fair for higher education to say that its aim is the pursuit and transmission of truth. For this purpose the institution is divided into departments, sub-departments, and sub-sections of sub-departments. The assumption is that nobody can discover the whole truth but that by a collective effort on the part of specialists in many fields the institution as such may get closer to the whole truth than any single individual.

    37. The reason it is perfectly fair for a college or university to say that its aim is the pursuit and transmission of truth is that in our society only these institutions have this aim. So Mill said of morals and religion: "What is special to an university on these subjects belongs chiefly, like the rest of its work, to the intellectual department. An university exists for the purpose of laying open to each succeeding generation, as far as the conditions of the case admit, the accumulated treasure of the thoughts of mankind."

    38 In this view a college or university is a place where people think. And the test of all its work, the test of the work of professors and students, the test of every course and every research project is: how much thought does it require? But can this be all? Does this mean that as long as there is thought it makes no difference what is thought about, or are some things more important to think about than others?

    39 The practices of higher education in America do not conform to the views of Mill, to say nothing of meeting the further question I have raised concerning the relative importance of things to be thought about. The three types of curriculum current in this country may be called the life-activities centered curriculum, the student-interest centered curriculum, and the professor-interest centered curriculum. The life-activities centered curriculum is exemplified by the course of study of a women's college, which is based on i job analysis of the diaries of several hundred mature women. The categories

    The activities of these women constitute the structure of the college curriculum, although women, perhaps, ought to do and may even be doing things that these mature women did not do. The student-interest centered curriculum, apparently on the theory that it is hopeless to try to understand education or to figure out what an education should be, simply takes the expression of interest on the part of the student as revealing what he should study, for who knows what he should study, anyway? The professor-interest centered curriculum is the more usual variety. Each professor and each department want the whole time of the student so that he can be thoroughly trained in the professor's or the department's specialty. Since it is obviously impossible for the student's whole time to be spent in this way, the curriculum is determined by a process of pulling, hauling, and log-rolling; and finally emerges as a sort of checkerboard across which the bewildered student moves, absorbing from each square, it is hoped, a little of something that each professor or each department has to offer him.

    40 None of these courses of study has any necessary connection with thinking. The activities of mature women may have had little to do with thinking. Some students may not be interested in thought. And I have heard of professors and departments who believed that their function was to cram their students with information. It is hard to contemplate such courses of study without agreeing with Henry Adams, who said, "The chief wonder of education is that it does not ruin everybody concerned in it, teachers and taught."

    44 As to religion, I need only refer again to St. Augustine to make the
    point that the resolution of intellectual difficulties seems to me, if not neces-
    sary, at least highly desirable as a prelude to or concomitant of religious
    faith. As to morals, habits are so much a function of the circumstances under
    which they were formed that we can have little assurance of their continu-
    ance in other circumstances unless the person who has the habits knows why
    he should retain them. As habits are formed by acts, they are broken by the
    cessation of these acts or by the continued performance of conflicting acts.
    The child carefully nurtured in good habits that he practices without com-
    prehending the reasons for doing so is likely to fall from grace when he
    casts off the parental apron strings. The serious consideration of the intel-
    lectual foundations of good habits should supply him with the conviction
    he needs in order to keep up in adult life the good work begun in childhood.
    45 The curriculum, then, should include the knowledge and understanding
    of the principles of morality. It should include both natural and sacred
    theology; for how can a man call himself educated who does not grasp the
    leading ideas that since the dawn of history have animated mankind? The
    institution must be committed to taking morality and religion seriously.
    This commitment involves a third: if the object of higher education is the
    truth, then, in order to take morality and religion seriously, the institution
    must believe that there is some truth and some discoverable truth about
    morality and religion. According to the dogmas of scientism, skepticism,
    and secularism there is no such truth. If there is truth at all, it is truth
    discoverable in the laboratory, by what is called the scientific method.
    Recently heard a minister of a Protestant church state at a public meeting
    that no man could tell whether a given act was right or wrong. I replied
    that he was a moral relativist, thinking that he would be so stung by this
    reproach that he might reconsider his position. Instead he proudly answered,
    "Of course I am a moral relativist," as though to say that anybody who is
    not a moral relativist is an unenlightened, unscientific, medieval reactionary.

    it may make are, perhaps, almost as important. These are the moral by-
    products of its intellectual work. The life of learning requires the support
    of the moral virtues; and an arduous academic career must tend to develop
    those virtues. Without courage or fortitude no one can long stick at the
    painful task of thinking and studying. Without temperance no one can
    resist the momentary pleasures and distractions that interfere with study.
    Without at least some rudimentary sort of prudence no one can allocate his
    time and plan his work so as to make the most of his academic opportuni-
    ties. Without justice, which involves a right relation to one's teachers and
    fellow-students, no one can conduct himself in the academic community in
    a way that respects the rights of the mind. I might add that as the student
    owes a debt of justice to his teachers, so his teachers owe a debt of justice
    to him, which they do not discharge by regaling him with last year's lecture
    notes.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Moral Philosophy and Education**\n\nThe text argues that higher education must reject dogmas of morality and religion in favor of philosophical inquiry and revelation. Using the text''s statements, explain why this rejection is necessary for higher education to take morality and religion seriously.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the text''s claim that truths of morality and religion cannot be discovered by scientific means.\n- **Step 2**: Justify why philosophical inquiry and revelation are alternatives to scientific methods for attaining truth.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a logical argument that higher education must embrace these alternatives to maintain its moral and religious integrity.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text''s definitions of morality and religion, and demonstrate a clear understanding of their relationship to higher education.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Character Development in Academia**\n\nThe text states that higher education can directly contribute to character formation through intellectual work. Using the four moral virtues mentioned (courage, temperance, prudence, justice), construct a logical argument explaining how each virtue is essential for an academic career.\n- **Step 1**: Define each virtue according to the text''s context (e.g., courage as the ability to persist through intellectual challenge).\n- **Step 2**: Provide a logical connection between each virtue and an academic responsibility (e.g., temperance as necessary to resist distractions).\n- **Step 3**: Synthesize these connections into a cohesive argument that demonstrates the role of virtue in academic life.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference each virtue and its corresponding academic role, as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Ethical Principles and Education**\n\nThe text presents a paradox: higher education must reject dogmas of morality and religion but also recognize the necessity of moral principles. Using this paradox, explain how higher education can maintain its commitment to morality without relying on religious or scientific dogmas.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the text''s assertion that morality and religion cannot be discovered by scientific means.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how philosophical inquiry and revelation can serve as ethical frameworks without being dogmatic.\n- **Step 3**: Construct a logical argument that shows how higher education can uphold moral principles through reason and intellectual discipline.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly address the paradox presented in the text and demonstrate an understanding of how ethics can be grounded in philosophy rather than dogma.'

    morals cannot be made if educational institutions confer academic recognition on those who have done little more for four years than sit out their time. Habits of industry, habits of initiative, habits of tolerance, and habits of independent judgment can all be promoted by the course of study itself and by the methods by which the educational process is carried on.

    49 If the bulk of the instruction is given by lectures, if the duty of the
    student is to take notes on lectures and to read textbooks, memorizing
    material to be regurgitated on the examinations given by the teacher who
    has taught the course, he may develop the habit of memory and the habit
    of studying the prejudices or curves of those whose favor he hopes to win.
    The first of these is a good and important habit, though perhaps not the
    best or most important of the intellectual virtues. The second is a habit
    valuable to salesmen, advertising men, college presidents, and others who
    spend their lives trying to get something from other people. But it is a habit
    into which most Americans seem to fall naturally; they do not need to go
    to college to get it. The value of the discussion method of instruction, of
    demanding a great deal of independent work from the student, and of a
    system of external examinations that requires study of the subject rather
    than the teacher, is that the habits of action, as well as the habits of thought
    and knowledge, formed by these means are closely analogous to, if they are
    not identical with, the four cardinal virtues.

    50 I should add that there is a certain moral failure on the part of an edu-
    cational institution that does not try to make its work something other than
    the accumulation of miscellaneous credits; for it seems unjust to expect the
    student to work hard on trivial, irrelevant, incoherent, and meaningless
    material. The vice of the adding-machine method of education is that it has
    a way of making even important subject matter seem trivial, irrelevant, in-
    coherent, and meaningless.

    51 There is a certain moral failure, too, on the part of an educational insti-
    tution that does not allow the student to make his own the treasure of the
    accumulated thoughts of the race. So the failure of the elective system was
    a moral failure. The official historian of Harvard said of President Eliot
    that he had defrauded the Harvard students of their cultural heritage. The
    failure of vocational education is of the same variety: in the name of a
    specious commercial or industrial dexterity it cheats the student out of his
    place in the stream of human history.

    Robert M. Hutchins's deliberative discourse runs to about the same length as Macaulay's deliberative speech on education. It should be instructive to compare the strategies of arrangement in these two discourses. What we soon discover when we look closely at the two discourses is that the differences in subject matter, purpose, and audience call for basically different strategies of organization. Both men are talking about problems of education; but Macaulay is concerned with the way to finance a system of universal education, while Hutchins is concerned with the content of the curriculum of the colleges. This difference of subject matter does not, of itself, call for a different arrangement of parts, but when this difference is combined with the difference in purpose and kind of audience, we begin to see why the two men developed their discourses in different ways. Macaulay's purpose is to persuade his audience of legislators to take some action—in this case, to vote in favor of a bill which will appropriate money. Hutchins's purpose is to persuade his audience, made up largely of people involved in, or at least interested in, higher education to adopt his point of view about the place of morals and religion in the university curriculum. Macaulay has to swing the votes of a hostile opposition; Hutchins has to influence the views of a generally sympathetic but largely uncommitted audience. Macaulay's audience, because of the lengthy debate that had already taken place in the House of Commons, was already well informed about the issues; Hutchins's audience is interested in the problems of education but has not as yet formed firm convictions about the particular problem being discussed in this discourse.

    As we have seen, Macaulay decided that the best strategy in his situation was to argue his case first and then refute the opposing arguments. Hutchins adopts a different tactic. He refutes the opposing arguments first and then advances his own proposal and the arguments supporting that proposal. Macaulay had so much confidence in the strength of his arguments that he felt he could more easily demolish the opposition by presenting his case first. Hutchins, on the other hand, felt that he could best "sell" his view by first clearing away the erroneous notions about the role of morals and religion in the college curriculum.

    By withholding his proposal until the end, Hutchins also adds suspense
    to his discourse. As he knocks down, one by one, the prevailing views about
    the place of morals and religion in the curriculum, the audience becomes
    increasingly curious about what Ae thinks the proper role of morals and
    religion is. And Hutchins has cleverly laid the groundwork for this suspense
    READINGS 352

    by announcing in the very first paragraph that "higher education can make
    a unique contribution to morals and religion." One can almost feel the grow-
    ing curiosity of the audience as Hutchins proceeds: if these are not the contri-
    butions that higher education can make, what is the "unique contribution"
    that it can make?

    Because this is a fairly long essay, the student might appreciate at the
    outset an overview of the organization. The outline of the main divisions of
    the essay runs something like this:

    Introduction (paragraphs 1-5)
    I. Refutation of the prevailing views about the place of morals and
    religion in higher education (paragraphs 6-35)

    II. Proposal and justification of his own view of the unique con-
    tribution that higher education can make to morals and religion
    (paragraphs 26-52)

    Conclusion (paragraphs 53-5)

    From this outline, one can see that Hutchins devotes thirty paragraphs to demolishing the commonly proposed "solutions," while devoting only seventeen paragraphs to justifying his own proposal. But this proportion is not as top-heavy as it may at first appear. We must remember that Hutchins has to refute several proposals; he has to justify only one proposal. And when we consider that he devoted about half as many paragraphs to the support of that one proposal, we are made aware that Hutchins had to do a considerable amount of "selling" of his proposal. He did not take it for granted that once he had refuted the other proposals his audience would immediately "buy" his proposal. Having cleared the ground, he still had to exert a great deal of rhetorical skill to get his audience to accept the "building" he wanted to erect on the cleared ground. As he said at the end of his first paragraph, "I can regard the building attempted here as at best a very modest structure, which will accomplish more than I am entitled to hope for it if it serves as temporary shelter to those who may design the ultimate edifice."

    Let us take a closer look at the parts now to see what Hutchins is doing in each of them and to speculate about their functions.

    We saw from the outline that the first five paragraphs of the essay constitute the introduction. What does Hutchins do in this introduction? In the first paragraph, he informs the audience, in a general way, of the theme of the essay:

    I believe that higher education can make a unique contribution to morals and religion. I do not believe that it can make some of the contributions expected of it, and I think that these expectations obscure the real purpose and achievements of higher education.

    Note that the theme is stated in general terms. Hutchins does not tell us here what the "unique contribution" is. We have already indicated why he does not tell his audience what this contribution is: he wants to arouse their curiosity.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Argumentative Structure**\n\nBased on the outline provided, explain how Hutchins balances his argumentation between refuting opposing views and justifying his own proposal.\n- **Step 1**: Compare the proportion of paragraphs dedicated to refuting other proposals versus justifying his own.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze why this balance is necessary, considering the role of ''selling'' his proposal.\n- **Step 3**: Use the quote from Hutchins to support your explanation of his rhetorical approach.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the outlined structure and the provided quote to demonstrate an understanding of Hutchins'' argumentative strategy.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Introduction Function**\n\nIn the first paragraph, Hutchins states his thesis but does not specify what the ''unique contribution'' of higher education is. Explain the rhetorical purpose of this approach and how it aligns with his broader argumentative strategy.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the function of stating the theme in general terms.\n- **Step 2**: Connect this to the overall structure of the essay, particularly the balance between refutation and justification.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this method is effective for engaging the audience.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of classical rhetoric and the outlined structure.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Evaluation of Rhetorical Strategy**\n\nEvaluate Hutchins'' use of rhetorical skill in ''selling'' his proposal. Consider the following:\n- **Part A**: How does the structure of the essay (introduction, refutations, justification) support his need to ''sell'' his idea?\n- **Part B**: What does the quote about ''temporary shelter'' reveal about his confidence in his proposal?\n- **Part C**: How does this strategy reflect broader principles of persuasive communication in classical rhetoric?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the outlined structure, the provided quote, and classical rhetorical principles to evaluate Hutchins'' approach.'

- prompt: "Hutchins also exerts a subtle ethical appeal in this first paragraph. Note  \nthe modesty and diffidence of his claims in this first paragraph—‘\"I cannot  \npretend that I have solved any of them\"; \"it may be possible\"; \"I believe\";  \n\"T do not believe\"; \"I think\"; \"at best a very modest structure\"; \"more than  \nI am entitled to hope for it.\" Hutchins comes to his audience—the original  \naudience for the speech when it was first delivered at Kenyon College and  \nthe later readers of the printed essay—with a certain antecedent reputation.  \nHe is a well-known and esteemed spokesman on education.

Logicians sometimes call such definitions \"stipu-  \nlative definitions.\" Whenever we cannot establish final, precise definitions  \nof terms, we can, in the interests of getting on with a discussion, stipulate  \nthe meaning we attach to the terms. In some cases, of course, we could  \nprejudice the discussion in our favor—we could \"beg the question\"—by the  \ndefinitions we propose. But in this instance, Hutchins is not \"stacking the  \ncards\" in his favor; he is merely preparing his audience to understand the  \nsubsequent discussion.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

    After this relatively short introduction of five paragraphs, Hutchins launches into his refutation of the claims commonly advanced about the contributions that higher education can make to morals and religion. The topic that serves as the organizing principle of most of his counterarguments is the topic of the possible: can this proposal do what its advocates say it can do for the development of moral and religious habits? In refuting the various claims, he relies a great deal on the testimony of prominent and respected men who have written on the problems of education (e.g. Mill, Newman, Aristotle, Toynbee); on definitions (e.g. the nature of man and his learning processes, the nature of education); on examples, from his own and others' experience; on analogies (e.g. how he taught Macbeth to inexperienced preparatory-school students).

    Although there is a discernible order to the progress of Hutchins's refutation, one would have a difficult time demonstrating that at every step Hutchins has observed an inevitable order. For instance, is there any reason why Hutchins had to consider the contributions that athletics can make to the formation of good habits before he considered the contribution that compulsory religious exercises can make? If we thought enough about it, we might be able to propose a reason, but it probably would not be a compelling reason. To say that the order of the arguments at some point is a rather arbitrary one is not to say that the essay is disorderly. Hutchins does ramble at times; he could tighten up the essay at several points; he could help his readers if he used transitional devices and connecting links more often. But all in all, Hutchins is too much of a disciplined thinker to write a chaotic discourse. The fact that no mature reader would get "lost" in this long essay is evidence that there is order here—order that one does not have to search very hard to find. Throughout the essay, one part leads naturally, if not always inevitably, into the next part.

    It would be tedious to trace out, step by step, the course of the argument
    through the forty-seven paragraphs of the body of the essay, but perhaps
    we can learn something about arrangement of parts by hitting just the high
    points. The main proposition that Hutchins is intent on refuting is this:
    higher education can make students moral and religious. His arguments
    attack this proposition from various angles. He starts out by questioning
    whether the moral and religious education of students falls within the
    province of the schools at all. To support his own views on this matter, he
    brings to bear the pronouncements of two noted nineteenth-century writers
    who, one might expect, would have contrary opinions about the place of
    morals and religion in higher education. John Stuart Mill is associated in
    the minds of educated people—and Hutchins's audience is made up largely
    of educated people—with the rationalism of the nineteenth century, and as
    a "liberal," he represented, at least for the members of the Oxford Move-
    ment, a threat to the religious spirit of the Victorian Age. Hutchins finds
    that Mill once made the same point that he himself is making—that scho-
    lastic education cannot make students moral or religious, Cardinal Newman
    is another famous spokesman on education, his Idea of a University being
    generally regarded as the classic statement about the function and end of a
    liberal education. Moreover, Newman is a Catholic and an opponent of the
    rationalist, utilitarian movement that Mill represented. But surprisingly—
    and conveniently for Hutchins's purpose—Newman holds the same view on
    this matter as Mill does. Neither Newman nor Mill denies that religious
    and moral training is important; as a matter of fact they agree that such
    training is pre-eminently important. What they are both saying is that the
    chief, if not the exclusive, function of a university is to train students intel-

    Although Hutchins's first argument addresses itself to the question of whether a university should educate its students morally and religiously rather than to the question of whether it can so educate them, it was a good argument to start out with because it concerns itself with the principle involved here rather than with the more debatable practicality of the matter.

    From this point on, however, Hutchins deals with what a university can do to educate its students morally and religiously. He presents and expatiates on a number of reasons why the university cannot contribute substantially to the moral and religious development of the students:

    1. The student's extra-mural environment—the home, his companions, mass media—has more of an impact on his religious and moral habits than the school does.

    2. The schools have only a limited time to exert an influence on the student.

    3. Good habits (Hutchins's synonym for "morals") are formed by acts, and mere instruction in good habits does not necessarily lead to acts.

    4. Nor can the schools form good habits by the extra-curricular activities they offer—sports, for instance, or compulsory religious activities.

    5. Nor can the schools make students religious, for a religious disposition depends on faith, and faith, we are told, is a gift that God grants to some and denies to others. (Can we deny educational opportunities to those who have been denied the gift of faith? )

    6. The solidest base for good moral habits is a strong religious faith, but since, as we have just said, the schools cannot give their students this religious faith, they cannot hope to make much of a contribution to the moral development of the students.

Summarize his main points in your own words, ensuring that each of the six reasons provided in the text is clearly addressed.\n- **Step 1**: Identify and explain each of the six reasons given by Hutchins.\n- **Step 2**: Evaluate the logical coherence of his argument, considering whether the reasons are independent or overlapping.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why Hutchins starts with the question of whether a university should educate its students morally and religiously, rather than directly addressing the feasibility of doing so.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your summary must include all six points and demonstrate an understanding of the argument''s structure, including its initial focus on principle over practicality.

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Counterargument and Ethical Consideration**\n\nHutchins states that faith is a gift from God and that schools cannot force faith upon students. However, the text also mentions that schools can influence habits through extra-curricular activities like sports. Construct a counterargument to Hutchins''s position, considering the following: \n- **Part A**: Argue that schools can cultivate faith through moral education and extracurricular activities, even if they cannot force faith.\n- **Part B**: Address the ethical dilemma presented in Hutchins''s statement: Can educational opportunities be denied to those who have been denied the gift of faith?\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast Hutchins''s view with a modern perspective on the role of education in shaping moral character.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your counterargument must incorporate at least two of the text''s points and demonstrate an understanding of both Hutchins''s position and potential counterpoints.

    The last question in this sequence that Hutchins addresses himself to—
    the hiring of professors—seems to be rather gratuitously added to the dis-
    cussion. At least it is not as germane to the main argument as the other
    points are. When he makes the point, for instance, that schools do not usually
    inquire into the religious and moral disposition of the teachers they hire,
    he is talking, not about what schools should do or can do but about what,
    in actual practice, they do do. Hutchins might have left out this last part
    without loss to his argument—especially since he confesses that he has not
    entirely made up his own mind about what policies schools should adopt
    in hiring teachers.

    If the student inspects the six arguments outlined above, he will see, as
    we suggested earlier, that there is no necessary order to the arrangement.
    The arguments do not always grow one out of the other, nor do they build
    climactically. They are just six pertinent, cogent arguments set down one
    after the other. Of the five most common principles of organization—the
    logical, the chronological, the spatial, the climactic, the associative—we might
    say that the associative order prevails here: Hutchins is setting down his
    arguments in the order in which they occur to him. The students might
    consider whether some other order could have been more effective.

    In paragraph 36, Hutchins makes the transition to the positive part of his
    discourse. Up to this point he has been refuting, rejecting. Now he must
    propose and justify the "unique contribution" that he claimed education
    could make to morals and religion. We have already commented on the
    suspense value of delaying his proposal until now. But he has gained some-
    thing more than the interest that can be generated by suspense; he has
    conditioned his audience to be more receptive to his proposal. Once the
    counterproposals have been dealt with, his audience is less likely to be in-
    different to his proposal than it would have been if he had made his proposal
    at the beginning. The mood of Hutchins's audience at this point must be
    something like this: All right, you have rejected the claims that others have
    made. What is there left to say? Does the study of morals and religion
    deserve any place in the college curriculum? If so, show us.

    Hutchins's method of argument in this section is basically deductive. The
    main stages of his argument could be set forth in the form of a syllogism:

    The proper function of a university is to lead its students to think
    about important matters.

    The study of the intellectual foundations of morals and religion
    would lead students to think about important matters.

    Therefore, the study of the intellectual foundations of morals and
    religion would be the proper function of a university.

    This constitutes the skeleton of his argument. But he devotes seventeen
    paragraphs to putting some meat on these bare bones. What accounts for
    most of the expansion is that Hutchins has to set up his premises and con-
    vince his audience of the truth of the premises.

    He establishes his first premise, for instance, mainly by definition. He
    asserts that the proper object of a university is the pursuit and transmission
    of truth. Among all the institutions in our society, only a university has this
    aim. And he quotes Mill again to corroborate his view. It is not quite clear,
    however, just how Hutchins gets from the proposition that the object of a
    University is to pursue and transmit truth to the proposition which serves

    As the major premise of his syllogism. In the first sentence of paragraph 43
    he points at how he got from one proposition to the other—"If we grant that
    the purpose of higher education is to think and to think about important
    things for the purpose of learning as much of the truth as possible about these
    things and transmitting it to each succeeding generation, ..." (italics added)
    —but he does not carry us, by a series of carefully reasoned steps, from one
    proposition to the other.

    Hutchins takes most of paragraphs 36-52 to establish the truth of his minor
    premise—"The study of the intellectual foundations of morals and religion
    would lead students to think about important matters." In doing this, he
    brings most of his arguments to bear on two points: (1) the importance of
    morals and religion and (2) the intellectual and practical benefits to be
    realized from the study of morals and religion. Just as he used quotations
    from prominent spokesmen on education to refute arguments in the first
    part of his discourse, so he uses here the authority of noted spokesmen to
    support his contention—Henry Adams, Woodrow Wilson, St. Augustine.
    We must remember that Hutchins's choice of authorities throughout the
    discourse has been dictated by the nature of his audience. Several of these
    authorities might have been unimpressive—because unfamiliar—to another
    kind of audience.

    Hutchins decided that there was no need to recapitulate and reinforce
    his arguments in the conclusion of his discourse (paragraphs 53-5). Instead,
    he chose to enlarge on the subject of the proper intellectual function of the
    university. This permits him to expatiate on one of his favorite topics—the
    Great Conversation. This plea for the Great Conversation may seem to be
    extraneous to the main subject of the discourse, but when one recalls that
    Hutchins began both the refutation and confirmation parts of his discourse
    with the claim that the cultivation of the intellect should be the primary
    concern of the university, the conclusion seems not as irrelevant as it first
    appeared. And in the last sentence of the essay, Hutchins unites and extends
    the themes of this long discourse: "Through continuing and enriching the
    Great Conversation higher education not only does its duty by morals and
    religion; it not only performs its proper intellectual task; it also supports
    and symbolizes the highest hopes and highest aspirations of mankind."

    So we have seen how one man organized his arguments on the role of
    morals and religion in higher education. If we were writing an essay on the
    same subject, we might, without any great loss in effectiveness, have arranged
    some of the parts differently, but given the same body of arguments, the
    same general purpose, and the same audience, we would probably find ourselves
    adopting the same basic strategy of arrangement that Hutchins employed.

    it their business to correct the speech and writing of others. When Winston
    Churchill says "It's me" in a radio address, their lips purse and murmur
    firmly, "It is I," and they sit down and write bitter letters to the New York
    Times about What is Happening to the English Language. Reading "I only
    had five dollars," they circle only and move it to the right of had, producing
    "I had only five dollars" with a sense of virtue that is beyond the measure
    of man. They are implacable enemies of "different than," of "loan" and
    "contact" used as verbs, and of dozens of other common expressions. They
    put triumphant exclamation marks in the margins of library books. They
    are ready to tangle the thread of any discussion by pouncing on a point of
    grammar.

    or the clarity of his expression, is likely to find himself attacked for some

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical and Linguistic Concerns**\n\nIn the text, the author contrasts the "unholy number of people" who correct speech and writing with their genuine concern for language.\n- **Part A**: Identify two examples from the text that illustrate this contrast and explain how they reveal the author''s perspective on language reformers.\n- **Part B**: Using the concept of "standard English" from the text, argue whether such a standard can be considered both uniform and definitive. Support your argument with reasoning from the text.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the author''s claim that these individuals are "moved by a genuine concern for the language." How does this contrast with the outcomes described in the text (e.g., people being "attacked for some locution")?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s themes of language purity and societal impact, demonstrating an understanding of both the intent and consequences of linguistic correction.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Misconceptions**\n\nThe text identifies two misconceptions held by language purists: the existence of a "correct" standard English and the belief that this standard can be both uniform and definite.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the author argues that "standard English" cannot be both uniform and definitive, using examples from the text.\n- **Part B**: Construct an analogy to illustrate how language is dynamic and evolving, similar to the author''s argument against static standards. Your analogy must reference at least two aspects of language change (e.g., vocabulary, grammar).\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the author''s claim that these misconceptions "are in the grip of their earnest minds." How does this statement suggest a deeper issue with language reform efforts?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s critique of rigid linguistic standards and their implications for language evolution.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Language Reform**\n\nThe author describes a "war" against language that is fought by those who believe in a "correct" standard.\n- **Part A**: Propose an alternative approach to language reform that balances the need for linguistic clarity with the acceptance of natural variation. Your proposal must reference at least two examples from the text (e.g., "It''s me" vs. "It is I").\n- **Part B**: Using the text''s discussion of language purists, create a hypothetical scenario where a community adopts a "living" standard for English. Describe the potential benefits and challenges of this approach.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the author''s argument that these language purists are "not retired teachers" but rather "found wherever educated people read and write English." How does this reveal a broader societal issue related to language use?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s themes of linguistic evolution and societal influence, requiring creative reasoning to address the complexities of language reform.

    3 The enemy these self-appointed linguistic sentries see lurking in every expression which stirs the corrector's instinct in them is something they call illiteracy—which is not a simple state of being unlettered, but something more. This illiteracy is a willful and obstinate disregard for the standards of civilized expression. It stirs anger in them when they think they see it, because it seems to them a voluntary ignorance, compounded out of carelessness and sloth. When they think they find it in men who hold responsible positions in the community, they feel it to be a summation of all the decline of the graces of culture, the last reaches of a great wave of vulgarity which is eroding the educated and literate classes. It seems to them to be a surge of crude populism; they hear in each solecism the faint, far-off cries of the rising mob. It is really a sort of ringing in their ears.

    4 In view of the general agreement among the literate that a "correct" standard English exists, and in view of the vituperation directed at anyone suspected of corrupting it, one would expect some kind of agreement about what is correct. There is little to be found; the easy utterance of one educated man is the bane of another. "For all the fussiness about which and that," remarks Jacques Barzun in the Nation, "the combined editorial brass of the country have feebly allowed the word ‘disinterested' to be absolutely lost in its original sense. One finds as careful a writer as Aldous Huxley using it to mean uninterested, so that by now a ‘disinterested judge' is one that goes to sleep on the bench." And on the subject of what surely is a harmless word, whom, Kyle Crichton, associate editor of Collier's, is quoted in Harper's: "The most loathsome word (to me at least) in the English language is ‘whom.' You can always tell a half-educated buffoon by the care he takes in working the word in. When he starts it I know I am faced with a pompous illiterate who is not going to have me long as company."

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nThe text discusses the concept of illiteracy as a willful disregard for standards of civilized expression. Synthesize this idea by comparing it to the modern phenomenon of ''texting speak'' (e.g., using ''u'' for ''you'', ''r u'' for ''are you'').\n- **Step 1**: Define illiteracy as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Identify the characteristics of texting speak that align with or contradict the text''s definition of illiteracy.\n- **Step 3**: Argue whether texting speak represents a form of illiteracy or a legitimate evolution of language.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s definition with modern linguistic practices, using logical reasoning to support your conclusion.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Language Standards**\n\nThe text critiques the ''corrector''s instinct'' and the enforcement of standardized English. Using examples from the passage (e.g., ''disinterested''), analyze why the author argues that there is little agreement on what constitutes correct English.\n- **Step 1**: Summarize the author''s main argument about the lack of consensus on correct English.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the examples (e.g., ''disinterested'') illustrate this lack of agreement.\n- **Step 3**: Reflect on the implications of this lack of consensus for language education and communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s examples and synthesize the broader implications of linguistic inconsistency.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Ethical Reasoning in Language Use**\n\nThe text portrays ''whom'' as a word that signals illiteracy. Construct an ethical argument about the use of ''whom'' in modern communication, considering both its traditional value and its potential to alienate speakers.\n- **Step 1**: Define the ethical dimensions of language use as discussed in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Argue whether enforcing traditional forms like ''whom'' is ethically justifiable in today''s communication.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a balanced approach that respects both traditional and modern language practices.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s critique of ''whom'' with ethical considerations, demonstrating critical reasoning about language and identity.'

    5 Probably only a cynic would conclude from the abundance of such com-
    ments that those who demand correct English do not know it when they
    meet it; but some students of language must have been led to wonder, for
    they have made up lists of disputed locutions and polled the literate on
    them. So far, the only agreement they have reached has to be expressed in
    statistical terms.

    6 The latest of these surveys, a questionnaire containing nineteen disputed
    expressions, was reported by Norman Lewis in Harper's Magazine for March,
    1949. Lewis sent his list to 750 members of certain groups chosen mainly for
    their professional interest in the English language: lexicographers, high
    school and college teachers of English, authors, editors, journalists, radio
    commentators, and "a random sampling of Harper's subscribers."

    7 If we count out two groups on the basis of extremely special knowledge
    and interest—the college professors of English and the lexicographers—we
    find all the others accepting about half the expressions. The authors and
    editors (book and magazine) were highest with about 56 per cent, and the
    editors of women's magazines lowest with about 45. (The expression which
    was least favored was less in the sense of fewer—"I encountered less difh-
    culties than I had expected"—but even that received an affirmative vote of
    23 per cent.) The distinguished electors seem individually to have played
    hop, skip and jump down the column, each finding among the nineteen
    expressions about ten he could approve of. If any two fell on the same ten,
    it was merely a coincidence.

    8 A person innocent in the ways of this controversy, but reasonably well-
    informed about the English language, noticing that the disputants ignore the
    massive conformity of most writers in most of their language practices, in
    order to quibble about fringe matters, might assume that they would wel-
    come the cold light of linguistic science. This is a naive assumption. In
    response to an attempt of mine to correct some of the misapprehensions
    found in Mr. Barzun's article—among them his curious notion that "de-
    tached" and not "uninterested" was the original meaning of "disinter-
    ested"—he replied by letter that I represented a misplaced and breezy
    scientism,
    and that what I said struck him as "the raw material of ‘populism' and willful
    resistance to Mind.... All dictionaries to the contrary notwithstanding, the
    word disinterested is now prevailingly used in the meaning I deprecated....
    The fact that an illiterate mistake may become the correct form...is no
    reason for not combating it in its beginnings...." This rejection both of the
    professional student of language and of the dictionary, when they disagree
    with the opinions of the writer, has the effect of making each man his own
    uninhibited authority on language and usage—an effect which I do not
    believe was exactly what Mr. Barzun had in mind.

    g What he did have in mind he stated clearly in one distinguished para-
    graph:

    A living culture in one nation (not to speak of one world) must insist
    on a standard of usage. And usage, as I need not tell you, has important
    social implications apart from elegance and expressiveness in literature.
    The work of communication in law, politics and diplomacy, technology,
    and moral speculation depends on the maintenance of a medium of ex-
    change whose values must be kept fixed, as far as possible, like those of
    any other reliable currency. To prevent debasement and fraud requires
    vigilance, and it implies the right to blame. It is not snobbery that is in-
    volved but literacy on its highest plane, and that literacy has to be pro-
    tected from ignorance and sloth.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical and Linguistic Concepts**\n\nIn the text, Corbett distinguishes between "snobbery" and "literacy on its highest plane." Explain how the author uses these terms to argue for a standard of language usage.\n- **Step 1**: Define both "snobbery" and "literacy on its highest plane" based on the text.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how the author''s argument for a standard of usage negates the idea of snobbery.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the author equates this standard with "literacy on its highest plane."\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the author''s rhetorical strategy and demonstrate an understanding of the social implications of language standards, as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Principles**\n\nCorbett argues that a standard of usage is necessary for effective communication in law, politics, and diplomacy.\n- **Part A**: Identify two specific examples from the text where this standard is crucial and explain why each example supports Corbett''s argument.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the author uses the concept of "currency" as a metaphor to highlight the importance of maintaining linguistic values.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate whether Corbett''s argument for a standard of language is consistent with the idea of linguistic freedom. Provide reasoning based on his description of "literacy on its highest plane."\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the author''s rhetorical strategy and the social implications of language standards.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Linguistic Concepts**\n\nThe author of the text suggests that rejecting professional linguistic authorities and dictionaries is problematic because it leads to "each man his own uninhibited authority on language."\n- **Part A**: Explain how this leads to linguistic chaos and why it undermines the "standard of usage."\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument that supports Corbett''s view that a standard of usage is necessary for effective communication in technology.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on the author''s claim that "literacy has to be protected from ignorance and sloth." How does this relate to the idea of maintaining a standard of language usage?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the author''s reasoning and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the social and practical implications of language standards.'

    It is a pity that these sentiments, so deserving of approval, should receive it from almost all educated people except those who really know something about how language works. One feels like an uncultivated slob when he dissents—one of the low, inelegant, illiterate, unthinking mob. Yet as a statement about the English language, or about standard English, it is not merely partly true and partly false, but by the consensus of most professional students of language, totally false. It is one of those monstrous errors which gain their original currency by being especially plausible at a suitable time, and maintain themselves long after the circumstances which give rise to them have vanished. Mr. Barzun's remarks are an echo from the eighteenth century; they reek with an odor mustier than the lavender of Grandmother's sachet. They have little relevance to the use of the English language in America in our day.

    In actual fact, the standard English used by literate Americans is no pale flower being overgrown by the weeds of vulgar usage: it is a strong, flourishing growth. Nor is it a simple, easily describable entity. Indeed, it can scarcely be called an entity at all, except in the loose sense in which we call the whole vast sum of all the dialects of English spoken and written throughout the world a single language. In this sense, standard American English is the sum of the language habits of the millions of educated people in this country. It is rooted in the intellectual life of this great and varied people. Its forms express what its users wish to express; its words mean what its users think they mean; it is correctly written when it is written by those who write it, and correctly spoken by those who speak it. No prim and self-conscious hoarding of the dead fashions of a superior class gives it its power, but its negligent use by minds intent on stubborn and important problems. There is no point in a tiresome carping about usage; the best thing to do is relax and enjoy it.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Linguistic Prejudices in Standard English**\n\nEvaluate the claim that ''standard English is a pale flower being overgrown by vulgar usage'' based on the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the original assertion in the passage and its historical context (e.g., ''Mr. Barzun''s remarks are an echo from the eighteenth century'').\n- **Step 2**: Compare this assertion with the text''s description of standard American English as ''a strong, flourishing growth''.\n- **Step 3**: Use logical reasoning to explain why the original assertion is ''totally false'' according to the text, citing specific terms like ''monstrous errors'' and ''consensus of most professional students of language''.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the text''s critique of outdated linguistic views and demonstrate a clear understanding of the contrast between historical and modern perspectives on standard English.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Standard English as a Dialectal Entity**\n\nExplain how the text redefines ''standard English'' in relation to dialects and linguistic diversity.\n- **Step 1**: Define ''standard English'' according to the text, referencing its description as ''the sum of the language habits of the millions of educated people''.\n- **Step 2**: Compare this definition with traditional views that might treat standard English as a ''single, easily describable entity''.\n- **Step 3**: Use the text''s analogy of ''the whole vast sum of all the dialects...a single language'' to argue that standard American English is not a ''single entity'', but a collection of diverse linguistic practices.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s argument that standard English is a dynamic, multifaceted entity shaped by cultural and intellectual life.

    12 There are five simple facts about language in general which we must
    grasp before we can understand a specific language or pass judgment on
    a particular usage. It is a pity that they are not more widely known in
    place of the nonsense which now circulates, for they would relieve the native-
    born speaker of English of his present uncertainty, and give him a proper
    authority and confidence in his spontaneous employment of his mother
    tongue. They arise from a common-sense analysis of the nature of language
    and the conditions of its use.

    13 In the first place, language is basically speech. Speech comes first in the
    life of the individual and of the race. It begins in infancy and continues
    throughout our lives; we produce and attend to a spoken wordage much
    greater than the written. Even the mass of writing which floods in upon us
    today is only the froth on an ocean of speech. In history, also, speech comes
    first. English has been written for only about fifteen hundred years; before
    this, it is of incalculable antiquity. In speech its grammar was developed;
    from changes in the sounds of speech, changes in its grammar come. The
    educated are inclined to feel that the most important aspect of language is
    the written form of it, and that the spoken language must and should take
    its standards from this. Actually, the great flow of influence is from speech
    to writing. Writing does influence speech somewhat, but its influence is
    like the interest a bank pays on the principal entrusted to it. No principal,
    no interest.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Language as Speech**\n\nGiven the text''s assertion that language is fundamentally speech, explain how this principle influences modern communication.\n- **Step 1**: Compare the role of speech versus writing in daily communication based on the text.\n- **Step 2**: Apply this understanding to a contemporary scenario, such as social media or digital communication.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your reasoning by referencing the text''s claim that writing is ''froth on an ocean of speech.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the hierarchical relationship between speech and writing, as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Language''s Historical Development**\n\nBased on the text, explain why the written form of English has limited influence on its spoken form.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the text''s main argument regarding the direction of influence between speech and writing.\n- **Step 2**: Use this to argue why the spoken language of English has remained largely unchanged for centuries.\n- **Step 3**: Contrast this with the role of writing in shaping the grammar of English, as described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the text''s claim that ''the great flow of influence is from speech to writing.'''
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Common-Sense Analysis to Language Usage**\n\nThe text mentions five simple facts about language that are essential for understanding any specific language. Based on the passage, explain how these facts can be used to evaluate a particular usage in English.\n- **Step 1**: Summarize the five facts mentioned in the text, even though they are not explicitly listed.\n- **Step 2**: Apply one of these facts to a real-world example, such as the use of contractions in informal speech.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this application provides a proper authority and confidence in the use of language, as suggested by the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how common-sense analysis can be used to judge language usage, as outlined in the text.'

    14 In the second place, language is personal. It is an experience and a
    pattern of habits of a very intimate kind. In the home, the family, the
    school and the neighborhood we learn the speechways of our community,
    learning to talk as those close to us talk in the give and take of daily life.
    We are at one with our nation in our easy command of the pitch, tune and
    phrase of our own home town. Language is personal, also, in that our grasp
    of its is no greater than our individual experience with it. The English we
    know is not that vast agglomeration of verbal signs which fills and yet
    escapes the largest lexicons and grammars, but what we have personally
    heard and spoken, read and written. The best-read man knows of his native
    language only a limited number of forms in a limited number of com-
    binations. Outside of these, the wealth which a copious tongue has as its
    potential is out of his world, and out of everybody's, for no dictionary is
    so complete or grammar so compendious as to capture it.

    15 The third fact about language is that it changes. It changes in its sounds,
    its meanings and its syntax. The transmission of sounds, words and meanings
    from generation to generation is always in some respects imprecise. Minute
    differences add up in time to perceptible changes, and changes to noticeable
    drifts. Difference in changes and in rates of change make local speech sounds,
    pitches, tones and vocabularies draw subtly and persistently away from one
    another. And all it takes to produce an identifiable dialect is sufficient segre-
    gation over a sufficient length of time.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Language as Personal Experience**\n\nThe text emphasizes that language is personal, shaped by individual experience and social environments. Consider the following scenario: A linguist observes two children growing up in different neighborhoods with similar home languages but distinct community speech patterns.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the text''s assertion that ''language is personal'' would influence the linguist''s understanding of these children''s linguistic development.\n- **Part B**: Justify why the text mentions that ''the English we know is not that vast agglomeration of verbal signs'' but rather based on individual experience. Use examples from the text to support your reasoning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the concept of personal experience with social environments as outlined in the text, and demonstrate comprehension of how individual exposure shapes linguistic knowledge.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Language Change and Dialect Formation**\n\nThe text states that language changes over time, leading to dialects due to segregation and duration. Consider the following situation: A community splits into two groups after a significant event, leading to separate social environments.\n- **Part A**: Using the text''s explanation of language change, predict how the two groups'' languages would evolve over time.\n- **Part B**: Explain why ''sufficient segregation over a sufficient length of time'' is essential for dialect formation, referencing the text''s discussion on perceptible changes and drifts.\n- **Part C**: Contrast the rate of change in a tightly-knit community versus a loosely-connected one, using the text''s mention of ''minute differences adding up over time.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how social segregation and duration influence language change, as described in the text.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Language and Individual Experience**\n\nThe text argues that language is personal, rooted in individual experience rather than a vast, comprehensive system. Consider the following claim: ''Language is a universal system that transcends individual experience.''\n- **Part A**: Refute this claim by referencing the text''s assertion that ''the best-read man knows of his native language only a limited number of forms.''\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument that aligns with the text''s view, using examples of how exposure to language varies among individuals.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the text''s conclusion that ''no dictionary is so complete or grammar so compendious as to capture it.'' Use this to argue whether language can be fully understood through formal systems or solely through personal experience.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s perspective on language as personal and experiential, and demonstrate critical reasoning based on the provided passage.'

    16 The fourth great fact about language, then, is that its users are, in one
    way or another, isolated. Each has with only a few others the sort of familiar
    relationships which join them in one language community. Yet there are
    upward of two hundred million native speakers of English in the world.
    Obviously they cannot all be in close touch with one another. They congeal
    in nuclei—some stable, some transitory—which by a kind of double-action
    draw them together and enforce isolation of many more-or-less shifting
    kinds: the isolation of distance, of education, of economic levels, of occupa-
    tion, age and sex, of hobbies and political boundaries. Any one of these will
    be reflected in language habits; any two or three will bring about, in one
    community, speech differences as great as those caused by oceans and moun-
    tain ranges.

    364 ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL

    17 The fifth great fact about language is that it is a historical growth of a
    specific kind. 'The nature of English is one of the absolutes of our world,
    like air, water and gravity. Its patterns are not subject to judgment; they
    simply are. Yet they have not always been what they are; like the physical
    world, they have changed with time, but always in terms of what they have
    been. Boy loves girl means something different from girl loves boy. It is
    futile for us to prefer another way of conveying these meanings: that is the
    English way, and we must live with it. Yet students of the language see in
    this simple pattern the result of a cataclysmic change, great and slow like
    the geologic upheavals that have brought old salt beds to the very tops of
    mountain ranges, and as simple. Each is what it is because of what it has
    been before.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Language Isolation and Community Formation**\n\nUsing the text''s description of language communities and nuclei, explain how linguistic isolation arises from multiple factors such as distance, education, economic levels, occupation, and hobbies.\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least three factors mentioned in the text that contribute to linguistic isolation.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how these factors create "nuclei" that separate individuals from one another.\n- **Step 3**: Use an example from the text to illustrate how these nuclei can lead to speech differences as significant as those between communities separated by geography.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s concepts of "isolation" and "nuclei," and explicitly reference at least two examples from the text.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Historical Development of Language Patterns**\n\nAnalyze the text''s assertion that language is a ''historical growth'' and explain how this concept relates to the idea of change in meaning over time.\n- **Step 1**: Reference the text''s example about ''boy loves girl'' versus ''girl loves boy.''\n- **Step 2**: Compare this to the text''s analogy of geologic upheavals that reshape the landscape.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss how this historical development affects the ''absolute nature'' of language as described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the interplay between historical change and linguistic stability, using both examples from the text.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Language Change and Stability**\n\nThe text describes how language changes over time but maintains its "absolute nature." Explain the contradiction and provide a resolution based on the text''s arguments.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the two opposing ideas presented in the text: change and absolute nature.\n- **Step 2**: Use the example of ''boy loves girl'' to show how meaning changes while maintaining the "absolute" structure.\n- **Step 3**: Reference the text''s analogy of geologic changes to explain how language evolves while preserving its fundamental patterns.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reconcile the text''s claims about change and stability, using explicit examples from the text to support your reasoning.'

    18 Language as a social instrument reflects all the tides which sweep society, reacting in a local or surface way easily and quickly—as a beach changes its contours to suit the waves—but it offers everywhere a stubborn rock core that only time and massive pressures can move. The whim of a girl can change its vocabulary, but no will of man can touch its essential structure; this is work for the long attrition of generations of human use. Ever lagging a little behind human needs, it offers a multitude of terms for the things men no longer care about, but keeps them improvising to say what has not been said before.

    19 Spoken English is, then, by its own nature and the nature of man, a welter of divergences. The divergences of class and place are sharpest in Britain, where the same dialects have been spoken in the same shires and villages for more than a thousand years. Although these can be heard in America by any traveler, no matter how dull his ear, they are relatively slight, for our language is essentially and repeatedly a colonial speech. Each of the American colonies drew settlers from various parts of Britain; each worked out a common speech based mainly on the dialect of its most influential group of immigrants (which differed from colony to colony); each remained in relative isolation from the others for about a hundred years. Then many colonists began to move to the interior: wave after wave of settlers traveled along rather distinct lines of advance until the continent was covered. Everywhere there was a mingling of dialects, with a composite speech arising, based mainly on the speech of the dominant local group. And so we have a Northern speech fanning out from the Northeastern states, and a Southern speech in the land of cotton-raisers, all crossing and merging as the pioneers moved west. Local differences are greatest along the Atlantic coast.

    20 Wherever our people settled, they worked out local ways of talking about the things of common experience, and found their own verbal symbols of class distinctions. Here and there are areas where foreign-speaking groups

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Language as a Social Instrument**\n\nAnalyzing the passage, explain how language functions as both a flexible and enduring element in society. Use examples from the text to support your argument, ensuring that you address both the ''surface'' changes (e.g., vocabulary shifts due to individual whims) and the ''core'' stability (e.g., essential structure of language).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concept of language as a ''beach changing to suit waves'' and ''stubborn rock core,'' demonstrating an understanding of how language adapts yet maintains its fundamental structure over time.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Dialectal Divergences**\n\nCompare and contrast the dialectal divergences in Britain with those in America as described in the text.\n- **Part A**: Explain why British dialects have been more stable over time, citing the text''s mention of ''thousands of years'' of continuous use in the same shires.\n- **Part B**: Describe how American dialects evolved, including the role of colonial settlements and the eventual mingling of dialects as settlers moved west.\n- **Part C**: Justify why the text states that ''our language is essentially and repeatedly a colonial speech.'' Use specific examples from the passage to support your reasoning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly differentiate between the historical contexts of Britain and America, showing how colonialism and migration shaped dialectal development.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Language Variation**\n\nThe text discusses how language adapts to human needs while maintaining its core structure. Using this framework, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: Construct an argument for why the claim ''All language changes over time'' is true, based on the text''s description of language as a ''beach changing its contours to suit the waves.''\n- **Part B**: Disprove the claim ''Language is entirely fixed and unchanging'' using the text''s reference to language having a ''stubborn rock core.''\n- **Part C**: Explain how the text''s mention of foreign-speaking groups in America relates to the idea that language is a social instrument. Use specific examples from the passage to strengthen your argument.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s thesis on language as both fluid and stable, integrating examples to support each part of the argument.'

    clung together and developed special exotically-flavored dialects, but other-
    Wise most speech patterns in America can be traced back to the dialects of
    Britain. Everywhere there is a common speech used by the multitude which
    works with its hands, and a slightly different dialect spoken by the pro-
    fessional and leisure classes.

    21 The standard English written by Americans is not, however, the written
    form of educated speech, which shows great local variation. Its spellings
    have only a rough equivalence to the sounds we make; its grammatical
    system, which has nationwide and even worldwide currency, had its origin
    in the educated speech of the Northeastern states, and before that in the
    dialect of London, England. The concentration of schools, colleges, pub-
    lishing houses and print shops in early New England and New York had the
    same effect in this country as the concentration in England, for centuries,
    of political power, commercial activity and intellectual life in London: it
    established a written standard, native only to those who grew up near the
    Hudson River or east of it. Elsewhere in America this written standard has
    been a learned class dialect—learned in the schools as the property and dis-
    tinguishing mark of an educated class. Like many of its spellings, it is
    itself a relic of the past, an heirloom handed down from the days when the
    whole nation looked to the schoolmasters of New England for its buok-
    learning.

    24 The common speech of the uneducated, on the other hand, is comparatively static. Though it varies greatly from place to place, it is everywhere conservative; far from corrupting the standard language, it follows slowly after, preserving old forms long ago given up by literate speakers. "Them things" was once standard, and so were "he don't," "giv," and "clumb" and "riz." Its patterns are archaic, its forms homely and local. Only its vocabulary is rich and daring in metaphor (but the best of this is quickly swiped by writers of standard English). Seldom written because its speakers seldom write, it is yet capable of great literary beauties, uncomplicated force, compact suggestion, and moving sentiment. But it will not bear the burden of heavy thinking, and anyhow, heavy thinkers have a better tool to use. It is about as much danger to the standard language as an old house cat.

    25 I have often wondered at the fear of common English and its speakers which the cultural aristocracy display, at their curious definition of illiteracy, and at the intemperance of their terms, which verges on the pathological. A Freudian should have a picnic with them. They use such epithets as illiteracies, crudities, barbarisms, ignorance, carelessness and sloth. But who is not negligent in language, as in the mechanics of driving a car? They mutter darkly about "inchoate mob feelings." They confess themselves snobs by denying that their attitudes are snobbish. The stridency of their self-assurance puzzles the mind.

    26 We might better adjust our minds to the divergences of usage in standard
    written English, for time, space and the normal drift of culture have put
    them there. We need not raise our eyebrows at a different twist of phrase,
    but enjoy it as an echo of a way of life somewhat different from our own,
    but just as good. We could do more than enjoy these things; we could
    recognize that the fixed forms of the language which do not come to our
    attention were developed in the past. We have come too late for the show.
    It is the changing forms that evidence the life in our language and in our
    society; we could learn much about our people and their ways by simply and
    objectively observing them.

    27 If there is one thing which is of the essence of language, it is its drive
    to adapt. In an expanding culture like ours, which is invading whole new
    realms of thought and experience, the inherited language is not wholly
    suited to what we have to say. We need more exact and expressive modes
    of utterance than we have; we are working toward finer tolerances. The
    fabric of our language is flexible, and it can meet our needs. Indeed, we
    cannot stop it from doing so. Therefore it would be well and wholesome
    for us to see, in the locutions of the educated which bring us up sharply
    as we read, not evidences of a rising tide of illiteracy (which they are not),
    but marks of a grand shift in modes of expression, a self-reliant regionalism,
    and a persistent groping toward finer distinctions and a more precise utterance.

    JACQUES BARZUN: THE RETORT CIRCUMSTANTIAL

    1 Mr. Lloyd's article is the culmination of a lively correspondence between
    him and me, in the course of which I feel sure that I repeatedly cut the
    ground from under his feet. Since from the outset he hadn't a leg to stand
    on, my efforts were bound to be useless, but we were both having such a
    good time that neither of us noticed his plight. At my suggestion he has
    consented to display his miraculous position in public, and I must therefore
    return to the charge. The public will judge.

    2 It seems clear in the first place that by preaching the attitude of the mere
    recorder, the registrar of linguistic fact, Mr. Lloyd disqualifies himself for
    remonstrating with me or anybody else. I, as a writer, am his source, his
    document, his raison d'étre, and he can no more logically quarrel with me
    than he can with a piece of papyrus. Nevertheless, I am willing to concede
    his human (and very modern) right to inveigh against my moralism in the
    tones of an outraged moralist.

    3 What then does his objection come to? That in seeking to criticize certain
    tendencies in current literary English, I am usurping an authority I do not
    possess, and interfering with the natural evolution of the language. This is
    the prime fallacy in his case, which rests on a chain of reasoning somewhat
    as follows: English has greatly changed through the ages; many of these
    changes were resisted by purists; but the evolution was irresistible, and the
    result is something we now consider correct and natural. Hence Mr. Barzun's
    attitude is contra naturam; he is an old fogey, a snob, and an ignoramus
    who thinks he can set his face against the future only because he is blind to
    the past.

    4 The truth is, of course, that one does not obtain "nature" by merely
    removing opposition, wise or unwise. Nor can we know what is inevitable
    until we have tried good and hard to stop it. The whole analogy with nature
    is false because language is an artificial product of social life, all of whose
    manifestations, even when regular, bear only a remote likeness to the course
    of nature. Being a social product, language is everybody's football, and that

    5 And here it is important to remember that resistance to change is by no means futile. The history of the language is not what the gallant liberals make out—a struggle between the dauntless Genius of English and a few misguided conservatives. It is a free-for-all. At this point it is usual for the advocates of the "Hands Off" policy to trot out the word "mob," which Swift attacked with several other curtailed forms, and pretend that it was ridiculous of the Dean to boggle at it, "in the light of what came after." Well, what came after is that we deodorized "mob," and abandoned altogether the other vulgarities he was deprecating: we no longer use rep, pozz, phiz, hipps, or plenipo. The future, in short, belonged as much to Dean Swift as to his opponents—and rather more if we count the hits and misses.
    6 So much for the pseudo-naturalism of the linguistic registrars. Their vow not to judge among words and usages is a fine thing as long as it expresses a becoming sense of incapacity, but it must not turn into a union rule enforceable on those who have taken precisely opposite vows—namely, to exploit, preserve, and possibly enrich the language. This is the duty of the writer, it calls for judgment, and it brings us to that blessed word "disinterested," which seems to have acted on Mr. Lloyd like a whiff of mustard to the nose.

    7 My simple and meritorious deed as regards "disinterested" was to draw
    attention to its widespread misuse as a duplicate of uninterested. Examples
    abound, and the fight against the plague may already be lost without the
    confusion being anything like over. Every piece of printed matter exhibits
    it, and nearly every conversation. Just the other day I heard this sentence,
    spoken to identify a stranger: "He is an impresario, but when it comes to
    art, he's completely disinterested." Did the speaker mean, X has no interest
    in art? Or: he is so much interested in it that money is no object? According
    to current usage this is impossible to determine without questioning the
    speaker. Not even his presumed degree of education will settle the matter,
    for the wrong use has affected all ranks.

    8 At the phrase "wrong use," Mr. Lloyd twitched his non-existent leg, and
    with his hands made the motions of a man taking to earth in a dictionary.
    A few American, and especially collegiate dictionaries do give the meaning
    "uninterested" as a second choice—which is a sufficient reason for me to
    view with a lackluster eye Mr. Lloyd's naive faith in lexicographers. The
    one work that seems relevant to the argument is the O.E.D., which gives us
    the history of the word. It tells us that the meaning uninterested is obsolete
    and it lists five separate earlier forms, going back to the French of Montaigne,
    all connected with the idea of "removing the self interest of a person in a
    thing." As an English adjective, examples are given from 1659 to Dr. Livingstone
    in 1865, with the meaning: "not influenced by interest, impartial, un
    biased, unprejudiced." My original remark was to the effect that nowadays
    the "disinterested judge" is probably taken to mean one who sleeps on the
    bench. My final remark is: As a writer concerned with the precision and
    flexibility of the language I use, I cannot regard the return to an obsolete
    and ambiguous form as useful or in any other way justified.

Use examples from the text to support your argument.\n- **Step 1**: Identify how ''disinterested'' is currently used in everyday language (e.g., the judge who is ''disinterested'').\n- **Step 2**: Contrast this with its original meaning as described in the O.E.D. (e.g., ''not influenced by interest'').\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this ambiguity leads to confusion in both written and spoken language, referencing the author''s examples (e.g., the sentence about the stranger).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the historical and modern usage of ''disinterested'' and its impact on communication clarity.'

    I now carry the war into the enemy's camp. If instead of complacently taking notes on the growing confusion, and protecting under pretext of "science" the vagaries of modern usage, Mr. Lloyd and his compeers would reflect upon their data, they might be able to safeguard the complex instrument of our speech by telling us when and why these deplorable losses occur, and how they might be repaired—loss of clarity and exactness at large, absolute loss of meaning in a word such as "disinterested" and in another such as "connive." Everyone has seen this last used as a synonym for "conspire" and "contrive"; I have heard it in the intransitive sense of "manage" about some trivial business. "How did you connive?" Hitherto, when you escaped from the concentration camp because the guard deliberately looked the other way, it was he who connived at your escape, no one else. Can it be that the action is obsolete and we no longer need the word?

    10 These instances are not isolated, and I shall accept statistical refutation only from someone who can show that he reads each year more written matter than I, and hears a greater variety of local uses from a larger body of students.

    11 Meantime, the generality which I hazarded, and which Mr. Lloyd assails as undemocratic and tainted with ethical feeling, is that with the rapid extension of educational opportunities, many persons of otherwise simple hearts are snatching at words half understood in order to bedeck their thoughts. Only the other day I read in a "literary" review about a distinguished American critic who was so full of insight that he could be called a voyeur.

    12 Foreign words are always treacherous, but what of the newspaper editorial which states that Mr. So-and-so's election is "highly fortuitous" (meaning "fortunate"), or the college dean who tells parents that his institution wives the students "a fulsome education"? Then there are those who believe that "to a degree" means "to a certain extent," instead of just the opposite.

    which we are all subjected, the corruption of meaning is rapid and extensive.
    We are at the mercy of anyone who thinks the sense of a word is discoverable

    13 To put it differently, the danger to English today is not from bad grammar, dialect, vulgar forms, or native crudity, but from misused ornaments three syllables long. The enemy is not illiteracy but incomplete literacy—and since this implies pretension it justifies reproof. There is no defense against the depredations of the brash except vigilance and no quarter given. I am certain that in this regard Mr. Lloyd, who writes with so much felicity and force, does exactly this in his capacity as a college teacher of English. Why then does he not square his precepts with his practice? I cannot answer for him, but to help his amputated philosophy to its feet, I want by way of conclusion to quote from a writer who, being anonymous and attached to both journalism and business, can hardly be suspected of flaunting pedantry and preciosity. The extract is from Fortune for November, 1950:

    1 A little band of Catholics is now conducting a shocking attack on the
    rights of their fellow citizens. They are engaged in an un-American activity
    which is as flagrant as anything the Communist party ever attempted—and
    which is, in fact, very similar to Communist tactics. They are harming their
    country, their Church, and the cause of freedom.

    2 Their campaign is particularly dangerous because few people realize what
    they are up to. It can hurt you—indeed, it already has—without your knowing
    it. It is spreading rapidly but quietly; and so far no effective steps have been
    taken to halt it.

    3 Even the members of this organization probably do not recognize the
    damage they are doing. They are well-meaning people, acting from deeply
    moral impulses. They are trying, in a misguided way, to cope with a real
    national problem, and presumably they think of themselves as patriots and
    servants of the Lord. Perhaps a majority of Americans, of all faiths, would
    sympathize with their motives—though not with their methods.

    4 They do not, of course, speak for all Catholics. On the contrary, they are
    defying the warnings of some of their Church's most respected teachers
    and theologians. The Catholic Church as a whole certainly cannot be blamed
    for their actions, any more than it could be held responsible a generation
    ago for the political operations of Father Coughlin.

    6 Its chief method is to put pressure on news dealers, drug stores, and book-
    sellers, to force them to remove from their stocks every item on the NODL
    blacklist. Included on this list are reprint editions of books by Ernest Heming-
    way, William Faulkner, John Dos Passos, George Orwell, John O'Hara, Paul ¢
    Hyde Bonner, Emile Zola, Arthur Koestler, and Joyce Cary. In some places
    —notably Detroit, Peoria, and the suburbs of Boston—the organization has
    enlisted the local police to threaten booksellers who are slow to "co-operate."
    7 ‘This campaign of intimidation has no legal basis. The books so listed
    have not been banned from the mails, and in the overwhelming majority
    of cases no legal charges have ever been brought against them. Indeed, it
    seems that the National Organization for Decent Literature deliberately
    prefers to ignore the established legal channels for proceedings against books
    which it thinks improper. Its chosen weapons are boycott and literary lynch-
    ing.

    8 For example, early last year committees of laymen from Catholic churches
    in the four northern counties of New Jersey—Union, Hudson, Essex, and
    Bergen—began to call on local merchants. These teams were armed with
    the NODL lists. They offered "certificates," to be renewed each month, to
    those storekeepers who would agree to remove from sale all of the listed
    publications. To enforce their demands, they warned the merchants that
    their parishioners would be advised to patronize only those stores displaying
    a certificate.

    9 Contact, a bulletin published by the Sacred Heart Parish Societies of
    Orange, New Jersey, listed fourteen merchants in its March 1955 issue. "The
    following stores," it said, "have agreed to co-operate with the Parish Decency
    Committee in not displaying or selling literature disapproved by the National
    Organization for Decent Literature....Please patronize these stores only.
    They may be identified by the certificate which is for one month only."

    10 Similar tactics have been followed in scores of other communities. Even
    in Nevada—a state not noted for Puritanical temper—the Council of Catholic
    Men has asked booksellers to purge from their shelves a list of books which
    included such widely read novels as Mr. Roberts and From Here to Eternity.
    When an Associated Press reporter pointed out that millions of people al-
    ready were familiar with these works, in print and on film, the state chair-
    man of the campaign, Paul Laxalt of Carson City, replied:

    11 "We've got to stand by the list. If we make one exception the list would
    be chopped up."

    372 ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL

    12 Such tactics are highly effective. Most news dealers, druggists, and similar
    merchants carry paper-bound books only as a minor side line. Moreover, they
    receive from the wholesalers more books than they have space for; if they
    remove one title from their racks, there are plenty of others to take its place.
    They don't want trouble. It is never good business to argue with a customer
    —so most of them readily comply with this form of private censorship. After
    all, their other customers, who might want to read a book by Faulkner or
    Hemingway or Zola, will never know that it has been suppressed, and when
    they don't find it on the shelves they probably will buy something else.

    13 For these reasons it was possible for the Archdiocesan Council of Catho-
    lic Men in St. Louis to report recently that it had "obtained the consent of
    about one-third of the store owners approached in a campaign to ask mer-
    chants to submit to voluntary screening. ..."

    14 Something—but not much—can be said in defense of the National Organization for Decent Literature and its local campaigners. A good many tawdry and disreputable magazines, paper-bound reprints, and comic books have been offered for sale on a lot of newsstands. A few publishers unquestionably have tried to base their sales appeal on sex and violence; the pictures and text on the covers of their publications often hint that the contents are far more salacious than they are in fact. (Such misrepresentation, however, is less common now than it was a few years ago, and both the contents and the covers of most pocket-size books seem to be growing less lurid.)

    15 It can be argued, too, that law enforcement agencies in some cities have not been vigorous in enforcing the statutes against obscene publications. Finally, the "decent literature" campaigners apparently feel that their main mission is to protect young people, whose judgment is unformed and who might be attracted to sleazy reading matter by a provocative newsstand display; they seem to take far less interest in the hard-bound editions of the same books available in libraries or regular book stores. 'The Detroit NODL, for example, states that its list is "not intended as a restrictive list for adults"—though it does not explain how adults could purchase the books if merchants have been persuaded not to stock them.

    16 But the motives of these zealous people are not the issue. The real issue is whether any private group—however well-meaning—has a right to dictate what other people may read.

    17 Clearly any church, or any sub-group within a church, has a right to advise its own members about their reading matter.

    18 Clearly, too, anybody has a right to try to persuade other people to read or refrain from reading anything he sees fit.

    19 The National Organization for Decent Literature, however, goes much further. Its campaign is not aimed at Catholics alone, and it is not attempting to persuade readers to follow its views. It is compelling readers, of all faiths, to bow to its dislikes, by denying them a free choice in what they buy.

    20 This principle is of course unacceptable to Catholics—as it is to all
    Americans—if they take the trouble to think about it for a moment. How
    would Catholics react if, say, a group of Jewish laymen were to threaten
    merchants with boycott unless they banned from their shops all publications
    which referred to the divinity of Christ? Some religious denominations be-
    lieve that gambling is immoral; most Catholics do not, and many of their
    parishes raise considerable sums by means of bingo games and raffles. What
    if some Protestant sect were to try to clean out of the stores all publications
    which spoke tolerantly of gambling, and to boycott every merchant who
    bought a raffle ticket?

    21 The principle at stake was set forth with admirable clarity by Father
    John Courtney Murray, S.J., professor of moral theology at Woodstock
    College, Maryland, in a recent address on "Literature and Censorship." He
    listed four rules, which ought to command the enthusiastic support of all
    Americans regardless of religious belief:

    (1) "Each minority group has the right to censor for its own members,
    if it so chooses, the contents of the various media of communication, and
    to protect them, by means of its own choosing, from materials considered
    harmful according to its standards." (He also pointed out that in the
    United States "all religious groups...are minority groups."')

    (2) "No minority group has the right to demand that government
    should impose a general censorship" on material "judged to be harmful
    according to the special standards held within one group."

    (3) "Any minority group has the right to work toward the elevation of
    standards of public morality ... through the use of methods of persuasion
    and pacific argument."

    (4) "No minority group has the right to impose its own religious or
    moral views on other groups, through the use of methods of force, coer-
    cion, or violence."

    *No doubt unconsciously, the Catholic War Veterans, Our Lady of Sorrows Post No.
    1046, underlined the similarity between these tactics and those of the Communists. In a
    February 25, 1956, mailing to book dealers in Hartford, Connecticut, it enclosed the
    NODL list of "objectionable" publications—and it quoted the Chinese Communists who
    have been conducting a campaign of their own against "objectionable" literature:
    "These books and pictures seriously harm those workers who by constantly looking at
    them can easily become degenerate in their thinking,' cautions the Peking Worker's
    Daily as quoted by Newsweek magazine, January 23, 1956. We have to hand it tu the
    Communists... who have launched a nationwide campaign against pornographic trash.
    ... Should not this example provoke a similar literary clean-up in our land where the
    morality of our actions is gauged by service to God and not to an atheistic state?"

    374 ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL

    22 And Father Murray went on to warn that methods of coercion are
    especially imprudent for Catholic associations.

    23 "The chief danger," he said, "is lest the Church itself be identified in
    the public mind as a power-association. The identification is injurious; it
    turns into hatred of the faith. And it has the disastrous effect of obscuring
    from the public view the true visage of the Church as God's kingdom of
    truth and freedom, justice and love."

    24 He quoted from Jacques Leclercq "of the Catholic University of Louvain,
    who is no slight authority" the dictum that "no government has ever suc-
    ceeded in finding a balanced policy of combating unhealthy sexual propa-
    ganda without injuring legitimate freedom or provoking other equally grave
    or worse disorders."

    25 Finally, Father Murray emphasized that "censorship in the civil order
    must be a judicial process," carried out under the statutes and according to
    the due processes of law.

    26 The conclusions which flow from Father Murray's teachings seem plain
    enough:

    For the National Organization for Decent Literature. It should stop immediately its campaign of threats, blacklisting, and boycott. It should then pursue its aims by the legitimate methods of persuasion, propaganda, and action through the courts. Most states have adequate laws against the publication and sale of indecent literature. In cases where the law seems inadequate, the legislature can be persuaded to amend it, by the normal means of lobbying and petition. In cases where the law is not enforced, public officials should certainly be reminded of their duty—and opposed at the polls, in the democratic way, if they fall down on their jobs.

    27 Above all, the NODL ought to consider the possibility of guiding young readers by positive rather than negative techniques. Youngsters are not likely to read trash whenever they have good books readily available. If they are brought up in homes where good literature is a constant part of their environment—where parents read to them from infancy, and encourage them to build up their own libraries—then there is scant chance that they will be attracted by comics or two-bit horrors.

    28 What has the NODL done to urge parents to give their children such basic moral training? Has it done all it can to foster topnotch libraries—public, school, church, and family? In how many communities has it sponsored campaigns to stimulate good reading?

    29 For news dealers, booksellers, and other merchants. They should muster the courage to defy any group of private citizens which tries to impose its own brand of censorship on the publications they offer for sale. And, with equal courage, they should set their own houses in order; they should refuse to sell any publication which—in their own untrammeled judgment—falls below their own standards as responsible businessmen.

    30 For the patriotic citizen. He should protest against the lynching of books just as vigorously as against the lynching of people. He should go out of his way to support the merchants who resist such coercion. He should point out to the members of the National Organization for Decent Literature (and to any other self-appointed censors in his community) the immeasurable damage they are doing to the American way of life, to the very foundations of democratic government.

    31 For the gravest harm done here is not to the Catholic Church—though as Father Murray noted, that is dangerous enough—or to the individual who is denied the right to choose his own books. The great peril is to the fabric of orderly government. It is always injured when any group takes the law into its own hands. And whenever such a brand of vigilantes succeeds in imposing its will by force, some other—and perhaps more sinister—group is encouraged to try the same thing.

    32 Dean Joseph O'Meara of the Notre Dame Law School recently put it like this:

    "Unfortunately many sincere people do not comprehend the genius of our democracy ...such people would deny free speech to those with whom they are in fundamental disagreement. ...They would establish a party line in America—their party line, of course. This is an alien concept, a totalitarian concept; it is not consonant with the American tradition; it is anti-democratic; it is, in short, subversive and it should be recognized for what it is."

    33 Still another eminent Catholic—Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts—summed up the case in even more prophetic terms:

    "The lock on the door of the legislature, the parliament, or the assembly hall," he said, "by order of the King, the Commissar, or the Fihrer—has historically been followed or preceded by a lock on the door of the printer's, the publisher's, or the bookseller's."

    has become a familiar vision; many of us share it. But we frequently differ
    on the question, who or what is doing the damage?

    2 In Mr. Fischer's view the damage is being done by "a little band of
    Catholics" who are "conducting a shocking attack on the rights of their
    fellow citizens" through the medium of an organization called the National
    Organization for Decent Literature, which undertakes to "censor" certain
    publications.

    3 I take a rather broader view. I see a large band of people, of all faiths,
    who are conducting a shocking attack on the reason of their fellow citizens
    through the medium of passionately irrational argument about important
    public issues. I believe that nothing is more damaging to democracy than
    lack of rationality in public argument. The foundations of our society are
    indeed laid in an identifiable consensus. But they are more importantly laid
    in a reasonable disposition to argue our many disagreements in intelligent
    and temperate fashion, using restrained language, avoiding misstatements,
    overstatements or simplifications, and endeavoring to define issues with pre-
    cision in the light of all the relevant principles and facts. I believe that
    whatever corrupts rational public argument corrupts democracy.

    4 It has seemed to me that censorship is one of the public issues that are
    being deformed by bad argument, emanating from all sides. Hence on May 4,
    1956, in a talk given before the Thomas More Association in Chicago and
    printed in the organ of the Thomas More Book Shop, Books on Trial, I made
    an attempt at a contribution to good public argument on this difficult sub-
    ject. Part of my argument consisted in stating four practical rules that should
    govern the action of minority groups in a pluralist society, in their legitimate
    efforts to improve public morality. These rules were not original. I had
    seen them stated in substance in a news release of a paper given at Marquette
    University on March 23, 1956, by Prof. Vernon J. Bourke of St. Louis Uni-
    versity.

    5 Mr. Fischer quotes my statement of these four procedural rules in support
    of certain conclusions of his own with regard to the activities of the National
    Organization for Decent Literature. Perhaps Mr. Bourke will undertake
    to say whether, and how far, Mr. Fischer's conclusions follow from the four
    norms of action for whose formulation, in language somewhat different
    from my own, he should be given the credit. (At the time of my writing
    there was no printed source to which I could refer the reader for Mr.
    Bourke's excellent paper; it has since appeared in the volume Problems of
    Communication in a Pluralistic Society, Marquette University Press, 1956.)
    My own major concern is with a broader question—the quality of public
    argument. My question is whether Mr. Fischer has made a contribution to
    rational public argument on the issue of censorship. I am afraid my answer
    must be No.

    FURTHER READINGS FOR THE STUDY OF ARRANGEMENT 377

    6 Consider the preliminary question of language. In his opening paragraph
    Mr. Fischer asserts that a "little band of Catholics" is "engaged in an un-
    American activity which is as flagrant as anything the Communist party
    ever attempted—and which is in fact very similar to Communist tactics."
    Does one open a rational public argument by two such attacks on the reason
    of the reader? That tired old cuss-word, "un-American activity"'—has it not
    gone the way of all cuss-words, into meaninglessness? And the tactic of
    slapping the label "Communist" on your adversary's position—have we not
    agreed that this is a tactic of unreason? As for the later argument by epithet
    (the NODL is "lynching" books), one hardly expects to find it in Harper's,
    however much it may be used on the hustings.

    7 ‘The more substantive question is this: has Mr. Fischer done justice to the
    NODL's own understanding of its purposes and methods, as these are stated
    in its explanatory literature?

    8 The literature is easily obtainable from the central office (31 East Congress St., Chicago 5, Ill.). On reading it, one would come, I think, to the following conclusions. The NODL is simply a "service organization," not an "action group." Its major service consists in offering to "responsible individuals and organizations an evaluation of current comic books, magazines and pocket-size books." This is the famous "NODL list." The evaluation of these types of publications (only these) is done singly from the standpoint of what is objectionable as juvenile reading. The standards of evaluation are nine in number. All of them are common-sense norms; none of them are special tenets of any type of "group morality." Methods of review vary for each type of publication. Five reviewers vote on each item. The purpose is to "encourage the publishing and distribution of good literature," as well as to discover what is unfit for adolescents.

    9 NODL also distributes information about ways of organizing decent-literature campaigns on the community or parish levels. It is clearly stated that the list is merely an expression of a publication's nonconformity with the NODL code and that "the list is not to be used for purposes of boycott or coercion." The recommended procedures seem to rest on the suppositions that the ordinary merchant is a responsible man; that he would welcome some assistance in ridding his shop of stuff that responsible parents fairly judge to be unfit for their children; that if he accepts the assistance, he is to be commended; that if he rejects it, he is to be left alone. (NODL says: "Instruct your committee workers to leave silently if the owner, manager or clerk refuses cooperation.").

    10 The general conclusion, on the basis of its own statements about itself, would be that the NODL looks to voluntary reform, through cooperation between parent-citizens and merchants, in an area where a special problem of public morality exists. That problem arises out of the ready accessibility
    to boys and girls of a rather immense amount of cheap literature that is objectionable on common-sense grounds of morality and taste.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of NODL''s Purpose and Objectives**\n\nBased on the text, explain how the NODL''s approach to literature evaluation and community campaigns reflects its stated goal of "voluntary reform through cooperation between parent-citizens and merchants."\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key components of NODL''s service as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how these components align with the idea of "voluntary reform."\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the NODL''s non-coercive stance (e.g., no boycotts) supports its cooperative model.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly connect NODL''s services to its stated objectives and demonstrate understanding of the text''s emphasis on cooperation over coercion.'

    1r Consider now Mr. Fischer's description of the NODL. "Its main purpose is to make it impossible for anybody to buy books and other publications which it does not like." "Its chief method is to put pressure on news-dealers, drug stores and booksellers to force them to remove from their stocks every item on the NODL blacklist." It "deliberately prefers to ignore the established legal channels for proceedings against books which it thinks improper. Its chosen weapons are boycott and literary lynching." It is embarked upon a "campaign of intimidation."

    12 Something is wrong here. When Mr. Fischer describes the NODL he is obviously not describing the same thing that NODL describes when it describes itself. Thus you have reproduced the perfect pattern—the perfectly wretched pattern—of so much American public argument at the moment. There is really no argument at all—at least not yet. The two sides are not talking about the same thing. Hence the exchange proceeds to the customarily futile end. On the basis of his own description Mr. Fischer asserts that NODL "is compelling [emphasis his] readers, of all faiths, to bow to its dislikes, by denying them a free choice in what they buy." Hence he defines the issue thus: "The real issue is whether any private group—however well-meaning—has a right to dictate what other people may read."

    13 To Mr. Fischer's charges the NODL would, I expect, reply to this effect: "But we are not compelling anybody to do or not do anything. We are not doing any such arbitrary thing as making our own ‘dislikes' the coercive standard for the reading of the general public. We are not trying to do any ‘dictating.' And as for denying readers of all faiths a free choice in what they buy—that is not the real issue at all."

    14 Thus the argument fulfills the customary American pattern. The next step is for the contestants to retire from the field, either in sorrow or in anger or in both. Thereafter their partisans move in. Epithets are bandied; labels are exchanged; non-sequiturs proliferate. Until finally, both sides mutter disgustedly, "So's your old man." And there is, for a time, a sullen silence.

    15 Maybe the argument could be rescued from this dismal end, to which
    most arguments in America seem to be condemned. Mr. Fischer could have
    rescued it, but he didn't. The NODL could have obviated the need for
    rescue, but it hasn't. The point where rescue begins is, of course, fact. Mr.
    Fischer notes the fact, but he abuses it to advance his own purposes. The
    NODL must surely recognize the fact, but it has not acted on the recognition,
    to the detriment of its own purposes. The fact is that in half-a-dozen or more
    cities and towns the police have made use of the NODL list in order to
    threaten, coerce or punish dealers in reading matter.

    FURTHER READINGS FOR THE STUDY OF ARRANGEMENT 379

    16 Unquestionably, officers of the law have full right to use the weapons
    of law, which are coercive. The point in question, however, is their use of
    the NODL list. This puts NODL in an ambiguous position. It cannot
    expect to have the thing both ways. It cannot, on the one hand, protest that
    "the list is not to be used for purposes of boycott or coercion," and, on the
    other hand, fail to protest against the use of the list by the police. It has to
    choose its cooperators—either the merchant or the police. It cannot choose
    both; for the choice is really between opposed methods of cooperation—the
    method of voluntary cooperation as between equal citizens, or the method
    of coercion as used by the police.

    17 If NODL consents to the use of its list by the police, it creates an
    ambiguity that its critics may rightly seize upon, as Mr. Fischer did; what
    is worse, it obscures from public view its own "idea," the altogether valid
    idea of voluntary reform. On the other hand, if NODL does not consent to
    the use of its list by the police, it should say so—publicly, and on every
    necessary occasion. Surely part of its service must be the supervision,
    conducted on its own principles, of the uses to which its list is put.

    18 There is another inappropriateness here. Officers of the law must operate
    under statutes which in this matter are, or ought to be, narrowly drawn. On
    the other hand, voluntary reform, precisely because it is voluntary, may be
    based on the somewhat broader categories of common-sense judgment. The
    latter are employed by the NODL, rightly enough. But for this very reason
    it is not right for the police to use NODL's judgments in enforcing the law.
    The law must have its own standards, minimal enough to sustain the chal-
    lenge of due process.

    19 In this connection another fact must be noted. The fact is that on NODL
    lists there appear some twenty-odd works that either have received literary
    honors or at least have been acclaimed by serious critics. Doubtless high-
    school teachers could not, without absurdity, make them required reading
    for their students. But the police cannot, without equal absurdity, make
    them prohibited reading. Such stultification of the law is itself immoral.

    20 There is a third fact of some consequence. The history of censorship has
    been a history of excess. The NODL has the problem of the local zealot,
    operating far from the central office in Chicago, and way outside the four
    pages of sensible procedures sent out from it. He or she "has the zeal of God
    indeed, but not according to understanding" (Romans 10:2). Such zealots
    are righteous, usually indignant, people. They have a good cause. They want
    results. What they lack is St. Paul's "understanding," which bears, he said,
    on "the way of justification."

    21 I shall not labor the analogy. The point of it, in our case, is that the
    zealot at times fails to see how his zeal for results may betray him into the
    use of methods that will in turn betray his cause. Mr. Fischer, for example,

    In his zeal for his own cause, which is a good one, he fell into a bad method of argument. Among other faults, he fails to distinguish between the "idea" of the NODL, which is the substantive issue, and the applications of the idea, which raise issues of procedure. In good "liberal" fashion he assigns the primacy to the procedural over the substantive. Contrariwise, in good "Catholic" fashion, the local zealot for the NODL cause assigns the primacy to the substantive over the procedural. He, or she, wants the newsstands "cleaned up"; and he, or she, in some instances doesn't greatly care how.

    22 At that, Mr. Fischer is more nearly right. In this sensitive area the question of procedure is all-important. Part of the service of NODL to its own cause should be what I can only call a service of fraternal correction. It should somehow find a way of rebuking, or at least disavowing, the local zealot who violates, or goes beyond, the cooperative procedures, none of them coercive, which it officially stands for. (As for Mr. Fischer, maybe I have myself done him some service of intellectual charity?)

    23 At this point, with all the ambiguities at least sorted out, if not cleared up, we could begin the rational public argument. The starting-point would be a fact—the existence of a "real national problem" (Mr. Fischer's words). Then the questions arise. For instance, does Mr. Fischer adequately measure the dimensions of the problem? He says:

    A good many tawdry and disreputable magazines, paper-bound reprints and comic books have been offered for sale on a lot of newsstands. A few publishers unquestionably have tried to base their sales appeal on sex and violence; the pictures and text on the covers of their publications often hint that the contents are far more salacious than they are in fact.

    He adds that "law-enforcement agencies in some cities have not been vigorous in enforcing the statutes against obscene publications." And that's it.

    24 Or is it? Others would maintain that this is an astonishing understate-
    ment of the real national problem. They see the problem much more omi-
    nously large. A major issue in public morality has arisen; the morals of
    youth are particularly involved in it; the problem is growing. They further
    see a causal line between bad magazines, etc., and immorality. And they
    feel it imperative to "do something" about the bad literature.

    25 When these last statements are made, they start up the current argument
    between sociology and common sense. The sociologist expresses professional
    doubt about the causal line between bad reading and immorality; he finds
    insufficient evidence for it. The common-sense view asserts that the causal
    line is sufficiently established by the nature, content, tendency, etc., of the
    literature itself. At least a strong presumption is thus created; and it fur-
    nishes reason for action, until—and maybe after—all the Ph.D. theses, pro
    and con, have been written.

    FURTHER READINGS FOR THE STUDY OF ARRANGEMENT 381

    26 The word "action" disturbs the jealous advocate of civil rights. He there-
    fore comes up with his own causal line—between any attempt at suppressing
    any kind of literature and the subversion of the foundations of the Republic.
    The common-sense view expresses doubt about this causal line. There is, it
    says, insufficient evidence that any such alarming consequences will follow,
    if the action taken is rational and prudent.

    27 Here the real issue begins to appear: what kinds of action, as taken by
    whom, are rational and prudent in the circumstances? And what promise of
    effectiveness do they offer?

    28 Mr. Fischer has his own program of action, which deserves consider-
    ation. He recommends two positive courses. The first is self-regulation by
    newsdealers, booksellers and other merchants. They should, he says, "set
    their own house in order; they should refuse to sell any publication which—
    in their own untrammeled judgment—falls below their own standards as
    responsible businessmen."

    39. It is not that the law cannot be used to solve our problem; it has been
    used in many ways. But the question is whether there are any legal
    means that can be used to solve it in a way that would not be an
    infringement on the right of free speech. It is as if we are trying to solve
    a problem by means of another problem, and there seems no way of
    solving the first without solving the second. The answer is that we have
    not yet found any such means. The law, in this case, seems to be
    inconclusive.
    40. What is the right of the state to impose on individuals a code of
    action that would be incompatible with their own conscience? What is the
    right of the state to impose on individuals a code of action that would be
    incompatible with their own conscience? What is the right of the state to
    impose on individuals a code of action that would be incompatible with
    their own conscience? What is the right of the state to impose on
    individuals a code of action that would be incompatible with their own
    conscience? The answer is, as far as I can see, that there is no such right.
    41. In short, the answer to the question of whether the state has a right
    to impose on individuals a code of action that would be incompatible with
    their own conscience is: No. There is no such right.
    42. The state cannot, in the name of the public good, impose upon
    individuals a code of action that would be incompatible with their own
    conscience. The state cannot, in the name of the public good, impose
    upon individuals a code of action that would be incompatible with their
    own conscience. The state cannot, in the name of the public good,
    impose upon individuals a code of action that would be incompatible
    with their own conscience. The state cannot, in the name of the public
    good, impose upon individuals a code of action that would be incompatible
    with their own conscience. The answer is: No.
    43. It is not that there are no legal means of protection against the
    invasion of privacy, but that they are largely ineffective. The law has,
    in this area, failed to provide reasonable protection against the invasion
    of privacy.
    44. The question of whether or not the law can be used to solve our

    the problem. The law is not in itself a solution, but it may be a means to
    an end.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing the Recurring Theme in Legal and Rhetorical Discourse**\n\nThe text repeatedly emphasizes that the law is not a final solution but a means to an end. Based on this theme, construct a parallel argument about the role of rhetoric in modern society.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the core claim about the law''s role as a means to an end.\n- **Step 2**: Use the text''s rhetorical structure (repetition, emphasis on legal limitations) to frame your argument.\n- **Step 3**: Compare and contrast the law''s limitations with rhetoric''s potential for persuasion without legal authority.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly draw parallels between the law and rhetoric, highlighting how both are tools with inherent limitations that require ethical consideration.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Legal and Rhetorical Parallels**\n\nThe text asserts that the state has no right to impose laws incompatible with individual conscience. Apply this principle to a modern ethical dilemma:\n- **Part A**: Choose a contemporary issue (e.g., censorship, freedom of expression) where this principle might apply.\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument that aligns with the text''s stance, using logical reasoning based on the text''s definitions of rights and conscience.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate whether this principle could conflict with broader societal goals (e.g., public safety, order).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s ethical framework and its implications for modern social policies.

    of legal action as a corrective in this difficult field of printed media will be
    astonishing to students of the law. If I mistake not, it is pretty generally
    admitted that the present legal picture is a muddle. It is further admitted
    that the difficulties encountered in trying to straighten it out are immense.
    There are the two sacred legal doctrines that must be protected—prior re-
    straint and due process. Furthermore, there are certain adverse high-court
    decisions that seem to have reduced the law to a state of practical impotence,
    not least in the two crucial areas of obscenity and violence.

    32 What is even more decisive, even if the law could be lifted to the full
    height of its legitimate potency, it would still be largely impotent to cope
    with the new problem of mass media, whose crude subtleties seem to defeat
    the subtle crudities of the law. The grounds for accepting the relative in-
    effectiveness of law in this special field, where the moral issue is not justice,
    are both theoretical and practical—to be found both in the art of juris-
    prudence and in the lessons of history.

    33 Mr. Fischer suggests two manners of action—one private, the other
    public—whose possibilities ought by all means to be explored and exploited,
    But in the course of rational public argument it would, I think, appear that
    his program of positive action is inadequate to the real national problem
    that confronts us. His negative demand is more acceptable. He wants organi-
    zations of private right to stop campaigns of coercion. So do I. Mr. Fischer's
    reasons are, I think, doctrinaire; further argument would have to illuminate
    the fact, if it is a fact. Whereas, I, as a Catholic, am not a doctrinaire.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Legal and Jurisprudential Concepts**\n\nThe text discusses the limitations of legal action in regulating mass media and the role of prior restraint vs. due process.\n- **Task**: Identify two key legal doctrines mentioned and explain how they conflict in the context of media regulation.\n- **Step 1**: Locate the two doctrines (prior re-stant and due process) in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how these doctrines create a conflict when applying to mass media regulation.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example from the text that illustrates this conflict (e.g., obscenity or violence).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the doctrines and demonstrate an understanding of their conflicting implications in media regulation.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Evaluation of Legal Theories**\n\nThe text critiques Mr. Fischer''s approach to legal action in media regulation and presents a Catholic perspective.\n- **Task**: Compare Fischer''s private/public action strategies with the author''s position, highlighting differences in reasoning.\n- **Step 1**: Identify Fischer''s two suggested approaches (private and public).\n- **Step 2**: Explain the author''s criticism of Fischer''s "positive action" program.\n- **Step 3**: Contrast the author''s non-doctrinaire approach with Fischer''s doctrinaire stance.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must show an understanding of both perspectives and demonstrate logical reasoning about their effectiveness in the context of mass media.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Historical and Theoretical Reasoning**\n\nThe text mentions the "art of jurisprudence" and "lessons of history" as grounds for the law''s ineffectiveness in media regulation.\n- **Task**: Construct an argument that integrates these elements to explain why the law is "largely impotent" in this field.\n- **Step 1**: Define what is meant by the "art of jurisprudence" in this context.\n- **Step 2**: Provide a historical example (from the text or your knowledge) that supports the claim of law''s impotence.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how theoretical limitations (e.g., moral issues not being justice) contribute to this impotence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be logically structured and reference both the text''s theoretical and historical aspects.

    ...it is not possible to prove the position, taken by some, that an action
    like the boycott of a moving picture is somehow "unrightful," or "un-
    democratic" or "unconstitutional." No one can show that such an action
    lies beyond the limits of a primeval American right to protest and object.
    The action may indeed be strenuous; but the American right to protest
    and object is permitted to run to some pretty strenuous extremes. This
    said against the doctrinaire, it remains true that methods of action which
    verge upon the coercive exhibit some incongruity when used by citizen-
    groups in the interests of morality in literature or on the screen. Even
    if they raise no issue of abstract right, they do raise the concrete issue of
    prudence, which, equally with justice, is one of the cardinal virtues.

    I hold to this position now, against Mr. Fischer (I think), and also (I think)
    against the NODL in its present ambiguous situation—certainly in its repre-
    sentation by local zealots and by the secular arm of the police.

    35 I further hold to my previous position that private agencies such as the
    NODL can perform an indispensable public function in the promotion of
    public morality—provided they understand what their function is. It is not
    to supplant the coercive function of the agencies of public law. It is to
    represent, soberly and honestly, the principle of voluntary reform, to be
    accomplished on the basis of social cooperation—that sincere cooperation
    which in America is always ready to be stimulated but often needs stimu-
    lation.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing the Concept of ''Unrightfulness'' in Protests**\n\nThe text argues that boycotting moving pictures is not ''unrightful'' or ''undemocratic.'' Using the provided text, explain why this position is logically consistent with the American tradition of protest.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key argument presented in the text regarding the right to protest.\n- **Step 2**: Justify why the text claims that such an action is within ''primeval American right to protest and object.''\n- **Step 3**: Contrast this view with the ''doctrinaire'' perspective mentioned in the text and explain why the former is more nuanced.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text''s assertion that ''the American right to protest and object is permitted to run to some pretty strenuous extremes.'''
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluating the Role of Private Agencies in Public Morality**\n\nThe text suggests that private agencies like the NODL can contribute to public morality. Using the passage, explain the conditions under which such agencies can fulfill this role effectively.\n- **Step 1**: Summarize the text''s definition of the NODL''s public function.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast the NODL''s role with that of ''agencies of public law.''\n- **Step 3**: Explain why the text emphasizes ''sincere cooperation'' as essential to the NODL''s mission.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the text''s claim that ''it is not to supplant the coercive function of the agencies of public law.'''
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Assessing the NODL''s Ambiguity and Public Responsibility**\n\nThe text criticizes the NODL for its ''ambiguous situation'' and ''local zealots.'' Using the passage, argue why this ambiguity undermines its public credibility.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the text''s description of the NODL''s current situation.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how ''local zealots'' and the ''secular arm of the police'' compromise its mission.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the text considers this ambiguity a ''reprehensible'' position for a public agency.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference the text''s assertion that ''the NODL... certainly in its representation by local zealots and by the secular arm of the police.'''

    36 This principle of reform is altogether valid in itself. Its applications call
    for prudence—concretely, as I have previously said, for "men and women
    of prudence, who understand the art of procedure, and understand too that
    we are morally bound, by the virtue of prudence, to a concrete rightness
    of method in the pursuit of moral aims." For the rest, the rationality of this
    method of social reform will be understood, and its pitfalls will be avoided,
    if we can all somehow hold to high standards of public discussion. In this
    respect the editor of Harper's has failed. But his failure is less reprehensible
    than that of Catholics who miss their present opportunity—and duty—to
    perform the instant task, which is to inject the Catholic tradition of ration-
    ality into a mass democracy that is rapidly slipping its moorings in reason.

    IV / STYLE

    The third part of classical rhetoric was concerned with style. Once argu-
    ments had been discovered, selected, and arranged, they had to be put into
    words. Words—either the sound symbols or the graphic symbols—serve as
    the medium of communication between the speaker or writer and his audi-
    ence. Elocutio, the Latin word for style, carried this notion of "speaking out."
    Lexis, the usual Greek word for style, carried the triple notion of "thought"
    and "word" (both of these notions contained in the Greek word logos) and
    "speaking" (λεγεῖν). The threefold implication of lexis indicates that the
    Greek rhetoricians conceived of style as that part of rhetoric in which we
    take the thoughts collected by invention and put them into words for the
    speaking out in delivery. Cardinal Newman's definition of style carried much
    the same idea: "Style is a thinking out into language."

    It is this "thinking out into language" that presents the most formidable
    problem in composition for many students. The sight of a blank sheet of
    paper paralyzes them. It may be some comfort to such students to know
    that the transcription of words on a sheet of paper can be difficult even for
    professional writers. Writing never becomes easy; it just becomes easier.
    Alfred North Whitehead once said, "Style, in its finest sense, is the last
    acquirement of the educated mind; it is also the most useful." The difficulty
    that everyone has, in varying degrees, in putting thoughts into language
    stems partly from the inertia that must be overcome at the beginning of any
    task, partly from the lack of something to say, partly from indecisivencss
    about what to say first, and partly from the variety of possible ways to say
    something.

    Inertia is a problem that can be overcome only by will power. One must

    STYLE 385

    simply sit down and resolve to write something on a piece of paper. Lack
    of things to say may be solved by the procedures discussed in the chapter
    on discovery of arguments. Indecisiveness about the order of the parts may
    be resolved by attention to the suggestions presented in the chapter on
    arrangement. The problems posed by the fact that thoughts and feelings can
    be worded in a variety of ways will be the principal concern of this chapter.

    One notion about style that needs to be erased at the outset is that style
    is simply "the dress of thought." It is difficult to determine just which school
    of rhetoric gave currency to the notion that style was ornament or embellish-
    ment, like the tinsel draped over the bare branches of a Christmas tree, but
    it is certain that none of the prominent classical rhetoricians—Isocrates,
    Aristotle, Demetrius, Longinus, Cicero, Quintilian—ever preached such a
    doctrine. All of these taught that there is an integral and reciprocal relation-
    ship between matter and form. "Thought and speech are inseparable from each
    other"—those words of John Henry Newman express the view of style that
    all the best rhetoricians held. According to this view, matter must be fitted
    to the form, and form to the matter.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Style and Rhetoric**\n\nGiven that style is not merely ''the dress of thought'' but an integral relationship between matter and form, construct a paragraph that addresses the following prompt: "The importance of clear communication in academic writing."\n- **Step 1**: Define style using the text''s definition of an integral relationship between matter and form.\n- **Step 2**: Provide two examples from academic writing that demonstrate this relationship (e.g., a well-structured argument and a coherent explanation).\n- **Step 3**: Conclude by explaining how this relationship enhances clarity in communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must explicitly reference the text''s definition of style and include two distinct examples from academic contexts.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Inertia and Writing**\n\nThe text states that inertia in writing is overcome by will power and suggests that lack of things to say can be resolved by the procedures in the discovery of arguments chapter.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the concept of inertia in writing relates to the initial difficulty students face when starting to write.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument that connects the procedures from the discovery of arguments chapter to overcoming lack of content in writing.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on overcoming inertia through will power is relevant to real-world scenarios beyond academic writing.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s concepts of inertia and discovery of arguments, demonstrating clear logical connections between them.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Rhetorical Structure**\n\nUsing the text''s view that style is an integral relationship between matter and form, design a rhetorical strategy for presenting the following topic: "The benefits of interdisciplinary study in education."\n- **Step 1**: Define the topic using the text''s definition of style.\n- **Step 2**: Outline a structure that integrates matter (content) and form (style) to effectively convey the topic.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how this structure ensures clarity and persuasiveness in communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s definition of style and demonstrate a clear, logical structure that connects content and form.'

- prompt: "This notion of the integral relationship between matter and form is the  \nbasis for any true understanding of the rhetorical function of style. It pre-  \ncludes the view that style is merely the ornament of thought or that style  \nis merely the vehicle for the expression of thought. Style does provide a  \nvehicle for thought, and style can be ornamental; but style is something more  \nthan that. It is another of the \"available means of persuasion,\" another of  \nthe means of arousing the appropriate emotional response in the audience,  \nand another of the means of establishing the proper ethical image.\n\nIf the student adopts this functional notion of style, he will have gone  \npart of the way toward solving some of his writing problems. He will begin  \nto regard style in the way that Stendhal conceived of it: Le style est cect:  \nAjouter a une pensée donnée toutes les circonstances propres a produire tout  \nl'effet que doit produtre cette pensée (\"Style is this: to add to a given thought  \nall the circumstances fitted to produce the whole effect which the thought  \nis intended to produce\"). The student will be guided in his choice of \"the  \ncircumstances fitted to produce the whole effect\" by a consideration of his  \nsubject matter, the occasion, his purpose, his own personality, and his audi-  \nence. Jonathan Swift's definition of style as \"proper words in proper places\" is not much help to the student until he has some criteria for deciding what  \nis proper. The determination of what is proper can be arrived at only in  \nrelation to the above-named considerations.\n\nSince proper is a relative term, there cannot be such a thing as an absolute  \n\"best style.\" A writer must be in command of a variety of styles, in order  \nto draw on that style which is most appropriate to the situation. This is not  \nto say that his several styles will differ radically from one another. Just as  \nthere is a common strain in the range of dialects that he commands in his  \nspeech, so in his writing there will be a certain tenor that persists as he  \nranges from the most formal prose to the most relaxed prose. Each man, in other words, has his idiom—an idiom that is recognizable in all his  \ndialects and styles. His various styles will result from the variations that  \nhe works on this common tenor.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Function and Style**\n\nGiven the definition of style as ''adding all the circumstances fitted to produce the whole effect that the thought is intended to produce,'' explain how a writer can balance the ''ornamental'' aspect of style with its primary function as a vehicle for thought.\n- **Step 1**: Reference Corbett''s assertion that style is not merely ornament but another ''available means of persuasion.''\n- **Step 2**: Use Stendhal''s quote to argue that style must align with the ''circumstances'' of the audience, occasion, and purpose.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example from modern writing where excessive ornamentation might detract from the clarity of thought, and explain how a writer could adjust their style to maintain both ornamentation and clarity.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate Corbett''s definition of style with Stendhal''s quote and demonstrate an understanding of the balance between ornament and function in rhetoric.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Functional Style Criteria**\n\nA student is tasked with writing a persuasive essay on the topic of climate change. Using Corbett''s framework, outline the criteria that should guide the student''s choice of style:\n- **Part A**: List three factors that determine ''proper words in proper places'' according to Corbett.\n- **Part B**: Explain how each factor affects the selection of style, using examples from climate change writing (e.g., formal vs. informal tone).\n- **Part C**: Justify why a writer must be ''in command of a variety of styles'' to adapt their style to different aspects of the essay (e.g., introduction, conclusion, data analysis sections).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of Corbett''s criteria for proper style and how they apply to the specific context of climate change writing.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Style and Idiom**\n\nCorbett argues that a writer''s ''idiom'' is the common tenor that persists across all their styles. Construct an argument that proves the following claim: ''A writer''s idiom is not merely a stylistic preference but a reflection of their ethical and emotional character.''\n- **Part A**: Define ''idiom'' according to Corbett''s text.\n- **Part B**: Use examples from the text to show how idiom is related to ''the appropriate emotional response in the audience.''\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to disprove the claim that ''idiom is only about style, not ethics or emotion.'' Your counterexample must reference Corbett''s discussion of ''means of establishing the proper ethical image.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate Corbett''s definitions of idiom and style with his discussion of ethical image, demonstrating a logical argument for the relationship between idiom, ethics, and emotion in writing.'

    How does the student acquire the variety of styles needed for the variety of subject matter, occasion, and audience that he is bound to confront? The classical rhetoricians taught that a man acquired versatility of style in three ways: (1) through a study of precepts or principles (ars), (2) through practice in writing (exercitatio), (3) through imitation of the practice of others (imitatio). Rhetoric textbooks are concerned mainly with laying down the principles that will guide the student in acquiring effective styles. Practice and imitation are exercises that the student usually performs outside the classroom. For his homework, he is required to write themes; or he may be asked to read "good writers," or to write a stylistic analysis of some writer, or to imitate passages of good writing.

    Although this chapter will deal mainly with the precepts of effective writing, specimens of prose will be presented later for observation, analysis, and imitation. Practice in writing will have to come from the writing assignments set by the instructor, but at this point it is important to remind the student that practice in writing is the most beneficial of the three means. Precepts and imitation can teach the student how to write, but it is only by writing that the student will learn how to write. One learns to write by writing. Once is enough to enunciate that truism; but its truth cannot be recalled often enough.

    With these few general remarks about style, we are ready to consider some of the precepts about style.

    Grammatical Competence

    In the study of style, we should be clear about the provinces of grammar and rhetoric. Just as the confusion between grammar and usage produced a great deal of needless controversy, so the confusion between grammar and rhetoric could hamper an intelligent discussion of the effective use of language. There are times, of course, when considerations of grammar will shade over into considerations of rhetoric. But while it is generally true that we must possess grammatical competence before we can develop an effective style, "good grammar" does not invariably produce "good rhetoric." Nor does "bad grammar" invariably produce "bad rhetoric." In April 1927,

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Style Development Principles**\n\nHow does the concept of ''imitation'' from classical rhetoric contribute to a writer''s development of versatile writing styles?\n- **Step 1**: Explain the role of imitation in learning to write, referencing the three methods of acquiring versatility (ars, exercitatio, imitatio).\n- **Step 2**: Provide an example of how a modern student might use imitation in their writing practice, based on the text''s suggestion to ''read good writers'' and analyze stylistic elements.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why imitation is considered more effective than mere study of precepts (ars) alone in developing writing skills.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the three methods of versatility and demonstrate an understanding of how imitation specifically contributes to stylistic development.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Differentiation Between Grammar and Rhetoric**\n\nExplain the distinction between grammatical competence and effective rhetoric as described in the text.\n- **Part A**: Define what is meant by ''good grammar'' and ''good rhetoric'' according to the text.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example where a sentence might be grammatically correct but not rhetorically effective, and vice versa.\n- **Part C**: Justify why the text emphasizes that ''good grammar'' does not necessarily produce ''good rhetoric,'' using examples from the text''s discussion of linguistic controversies.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly differentiate between the two concepts and demonstrate an understanding of their distinct roles in writing.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Rhetorical Precepts to Modern Writing**\n\nHow can the principles of effective writing from this chapter be applied to a modern student''s writing assignment?\n- **Part A**: Describe how the text''s recommendation to ''write themes'' and ''imitate passages of good writing'' can be used to develop both grammatical competence and rhetorical effectiveness.\n- **Part B**: Explain the significance of the statement ''One learns to write by writing'' in the context of a student''s practice.\n- **Part C**: Construct a hypothetical writing scenario where a student applies all three methods of versatility (ars, exercitatio, imitatio) to improve their writing.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the three methods of versatility and demonstrate how they can be applied in a modern academic writing context.'

    While awaiting execution in prison, Bartolomeo Vanzetti made this statement to a reporter:

    If it had not been for these things, I might have lived out my life, talking at street corners to scornful men. I might have died, unmarked, unknown, a failure. Now we are not a failure. This is our career and our triumph. Never in our full life can we hope to do such work for tolerance, for justice, for man's understanding of man, as now we do by an accident.

    There are a number of errors in grammar and idiom in this utterance, but the passage has such a moving eloquence about it that it has become the most memorable statement to issue from the famous Sacco-Vanzetti case. Translated into flawless English, the utterance loses a great deal of its rhetorical effectiveness.

    The smallest unit that falls within the province of rhetoric is the word. Unlike grammar, rhetoric is not concerned with parts of words, such as morphemes (the smallest segments that have meaning) and phonemes (those contrasting sound segments which enable a native speaker of the language to "hear" different words). It might be well at this point to set side by side the provinces of grammar and rhetoric:

    GRAMMAR: phoneme—syllable—word—phrase—clause
    RHETORIC: word—phrase—clause—paragraph—division—whole composition

    It is clear from this schema that grammar and rhetoric overlap in the areas of the word, the phrase, and the clause. But although grammar and rhetoric deal with these common elements, their concern with these elements is not, strictly speaking, the same. Commonly we think of grammar as being concerned with "correctness" and of rhetoric as being concerned with "effectiveness." What we mean—or what we should mean—when we say that grammar is concerned with "correctness" is that grammar is preoccupied with how a particular language works—how words are formed and how words can be put together in phrases and clauses. What we mean when we say that rhetoric is concerned with "effectiveness" is that rhetoric deals with the choice of the "best" from a number of possible expressions in a language.

    We can illustrate the difference by looking at an English sentence:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Grammar and Rhetoric Concepts**\n\nCompare the roles of grammar and rhetoric in the context of the Sacco-Vanzetti statement.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two grammatical elements (e.g., word, phrase, clause) and explain how they contribute to the sentence''s structural correctness.\n- **Step 2**: Identify two rhetorical elements (e.g., paragraph, division, whole composition) and explain how they contribute to the statement''s persuasive effectiveness.\n- **Step 3**: Use specific examples from the text to show how the Sacco-Vanzetti statement integrates both grammatical accuracy and rhetorical effectiveness.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly distinguish between the functions of grammar and rhetoric while demonstrating an understanding of how they are used in the given statement.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Rhetorical Effectiveness in Language Use**\n\nAnalyze the rhetorical strategy used in the Sacco-Vanzetti statement to convey their sense of triumph and purpose.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the rhetorical appeal (ethos, pathos, logos) that is most prominent in their statement.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the structure of the sentence (e.g., parallelism, repetition) reinforces this appeal.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why the original statement''s rhetorical effectiveness is diminished when translated into flawless English.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must connect the rhetorical elements to the emotional impact of the statement and demonstrate an understanding of how language choices affect persuasion.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Language Hierarchy**\n\nUsing the schema provided in the text, explain how the elements of grammar and rhetoric are organized hierarchically.\n- **Step 1**: Define the hierarchy from smallest to largest unit (phoneme, morpheme, word, phrase, clause, paragraph, division, whole composition).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how grammar and rhetoric overlap in the hierarchy, using specific examples from the text.\n- **Step 3**: Construct an argument that demonstrates how the hierarchy ensures both structural correctness and persuasive effectiveness in written communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly articulate the hierarchical relationship between grammar and rhetoric while demonstrating an understanding of their complementary roles in language use.'

    He already has forgive them for leaving, before the curtain fell, the
    theater.

    What the grammarian would pounce on here would be the word forgive.
    He would point out that modern English forms the perfect tense of the
    third-person singular verb with the auxiliary verb has and the past participle
    of the main verb. Once the grammarian had changed the verb in this
    sentence to has forgiven, he would have no more grammatical errors to cor-
    rect in the sentence—that is, he would have to make no further changes in
    word order, inflections, or function words. But if the grammarian were to
    assume the additional role of the rhetorician, he would probably recommend
    further changes in the sentence. Although it is grammatically possible to
    place the word already and the clause before the curtain fell in the positions
    they now occupy in the sentence, it would be rhetorically advisable to alter
    the word order. The rhetorician would recommend that, in normal circum-
    stances, the sentence read this way:

    He has already forgiven them for leaving the theater before the
    curtain fell.

    He would probably justify the changes in word order on the grounds that
    the sentence reads more naturally, more euphoniously, that way. There
    might be a rhetorical situation which would justify placing the adverb
    clause where it was in the original sentence, but it is difficult to imagine
    what that situation would be. On the other hand, it is easy to imagine a
    situation that would justify putting already at the head of the sentence. If,
    for instance, we wanted to emphasize the time element, we might say,
    "Already he has forgiven them..."

    Grammar would be concerned with the disposition of a word or clause
    only if the placement were impossible in English or would change the
    intended meaning of the sentence. English grammar would not permit this
    arrangement of words, for instance: He has forgiven already them. And if
    we were to say, "He had forgiven them before the curtain fell for leaving,"
    the grammarian might ignore the awkward placement of the adverb clause,
    but he would have to point out that by such placement we have changed
    the meaning of the sentence: the adverb clause now modifies had forgiven;
    in the original sentence the adverb clause modified the gerund leaving.

    Rhetoric and grammar are concerned, of course, with something more than just the placement of words, phrases, and clauses in a sentence, but this discussion of placement does illustrate the difference in the interest that grammar and rhetoric take in words.

    Choice of Diction

    AN ADEQUATE VOCABULARY

    Classical rhetoricians commonly considered style under two main heads: choice of diction, and composition of words in sentences. We will consider first the choice of diction.

    CHOICE OF DICTION 389

    In order to develop a good style, the student must have, in addition to grammatical competence, an ample vocabulary. How does he acquire the rich vocabulary he needs to develop a good style? There is no magic formula, certainly; the best advice that one can give the student is to urge him to read at every opportunity. There is no doubt that persistent reading will add immeasurably to his vocabulary resources. Every English teacher is willing to testify that the best writing is usually done by those students who have been omnivorous readers. Not only do such students have more to say on any given subject, but they seem to have at their command the words they need to express what they have to say. We more easily remember the words that we encounter repeatedly in our reading. How we remember and recall words at the appropriate time is not known. But we do know that a man cannot give what he does not have. The man who reads a great deal is more likely to encounter new words than the man who merely keeps his ears open to the speech that is constantly swirling about him. The reason for this is that the vocabulary for impromptu talk and conversation is considerably more limited than the vocabulary for written prose.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Diction and Vocabulary Development**\n\nUsing the passage on choice of diction, explain how a student can develop an adequate vocabulary to support good writing style.\n- **Step 1**: Summarize the main argument about vocabulary acquisition from the text.\n- **Step 2**: Use logical reasoning to compare reading and listening as sources of vocabulary.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a practical strategy for students to apply the text''s advice in their own learning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of diction and vocabulary development as discussed in the text, with a clear explanation of how reading contributes to a richer vocabulary than passive listening.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Memory and Vocabulary**\n\nThe text states that ''we more easily remember the words that we encounter repeatedly in our reading.'' Using this statement, construct an argument about why vocabulary is more effectively developed through reading than through other methods.\n- **Part A**: Define the term ''diction'' as it is used in the text.\n- **Part B**: Explain how repeated exposure to words through reading facilitates retention and recall.\n- **Part C**: Draw a conclusion about the relationship between vocabulary development and effective communication based on the text''s reasoning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text''s emphasis on repeated exposure and its impact on memory, with a clear connection to the role of diction in communication.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Style Development**\n\nThe text suggests that a student''s ability to write well is closely tied to their vocabulary. Imagine you are a student who has been reading a lot but still struggles with expressing ideas clearly. How would you apply the text''s advice to improve your writing style?\n- **Step 1**: Identify which parts of the text support the idea that reading is essential for vocabulary.\n- **Step 2**: Propose a specific plan to implement the text''s advice in your daily routine.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how this plan will lead to improvements in your writing style.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s argument and show how practical application can enhance your ability to use appropriate diction in writing.'

    The writer who has words ready when he needs them is in a happy condition indeed. When apt words come readily, he knows that he has gained command over words. He must feel something of the assurance displayed by the centurion in the New Testament: "I say to one, ‘Go,' and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,' and he comes." What is especially fortunate about such a verbal facility is that words which present themselves readily are likely to be the "proper words in proper places." When we have to strain for the mot juste, there is always the danger that the word finally chosen will be slightly awry.

    So the student who wants to acquire an adequate vocabulary should heed the advice to read, read, read. But let him not trust solely to unconscious acquisition. Although he will absorb many new words merely by meeting them frequently, he will accelerate the assimilation of new words if he will take the trouble to look up the meaning of unfamiliar words as he meets them. As Henry James said, "Try to be one of the people on whom nothing is lost!" The student will be amazed at how quickly and solidly his vocabulary grows if he takes the trouble to consult his dictionary every time he meets a new word.

    Consulting the meaning of new words as one meets them is the best of the conscious methods of increasing one's vocabulary. It is best because it is functional: the student is pursuing the meanings of words that he needs to know in order to understand what he reads.

    There are other conscious ways to accelerate the acquisition of a rich vocabulary. One of these is to study lists of "new," "unusual," or "useful" words. We can add rapidly to our stock of words by such a systematic study of word-lists, and the student who feels himself to be notably deficient in vocabulary can expedite the catching-up process by learning and constantly reviewing a recommended list of words. There are many vocabulary studies available, which the student who wants to add quickly to his knowledge of words would be well advised to consult.

    The student should be warned, however, that this is the least satisfactory of the methods of vocabulary study. For one thing, he is studying words in isolation, not in a context. Studying words out of context can have a number of unfortunate consequences. First of all, knowledge of words tends to become an end in itself instead of a means. For another thing, the meanings of words studied out of context tend not to "stick" with the student as readily as they do when words are seen in the context of the reading that the student does. Any teacher who has subjected his students to the study of selected word-lists knows how often he has been disappointed by seeing few of these words appear in the writing his students submit to him. The third consequence of studying words out of context is that students often use these words ineptly or unidiomatically. The student who writes, "George ate his chicken with hedonistic gusto," reveals his awareness that hedonistic has some connection with sensuous pleasure, but he reveals also that he has not yet acquired the fine sense of knowing when words "fit." Nor does it help much to insist that the student should compose a sentence using the word he has just looked up, because if he has not seen or heard the word used aptly he has no guide to its use. The student should not be discouraged, of course, from investigating the meanings of words that he finds in some recommended list, because there is always some profit in such a pursuit, but the student should be aware of the limitations of such an approach to words.

    If writers have any reference tools on their desks, they are most likely to have a dictionary and a thesaurus. Writers often resort to their dictionary for spelling, for syllabication of words, for meanings of words. They do not resort to a thesaurus as often as they do to a dictionary, but it is the rare writer who has not sometimes felt the need to consult a thesaurus. A thesaurus is indeed a valuable vocabulary-aid when the exact word that we need does not come to us readily.

- prompt: "The most famous thesaurus—the one which has become as much associated  \nwith synonymy as Webster is with lexicography and Bulfinch with mythol-  \nogy—is Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases, compiled orig-  \ninally by an English physician, Peter Mark Roget, and first published in  \nLondon in 1852. Roget arranged his \"treasury of words\" under topical head-  \nings. Subsequent editors have revised the original Thesaurus, adding new  \nwords and removing some that had become obsolete, and the most recent  \n\nCHOICE OF DICTION 301\n\neditors have arranged the entries in alphabetical order to facilitate use. There  \nare many inexpensive editions of Roget's available today, as well as other  \nthesauruses prepared by modern editors. The student will find enough use  \nfor a thesaurus to warrant his buying a copy.\n\nA thesaurus merely lists synonyms (and some antonyms) for the entry  \nword, with cross-references to other entries. Since synonyms seldom if ever  \nare identical in meaning, a student needs considerable knowledge of words  \nand a fine discrimination to use a thesaurus intelligently. Suppose that the  \nstudent is composing a paragraph describing the people who attended  \nthe opening of an opera season. In one of the sentences, he wants to convey  \nthe idea that the women who attended this event displayed a lack of taste and  \nmoderation in the way they dressed. He has written the sentence this way:\n\nThe ladies ostentatiously showed off their silks and satins and dia-  \nmonds.\n\nBut he is not satisfied with the sentence. For one thing, he does not like the  \nawkwardness of showed off. For another thing, he senses that there is some-  \nthing repetitious about ostentatiously showed off (doesn't ostentation mean  \n\"a show\"?) Well, he will have to reword, perhaps recast, the sentence. If  \nthe new words or new phrases do not come to him immediately, he may  \nfind help in a thesaurus. But where does he start in the thesaurus?\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."

- prompt: "Part of the difficulty in using a thesaurus is knowing just which entry one  \nshould consult. If one merely wants a substitute for a word, he has only to  \nconsult the entry for that word in the thesaurus. But sometimes one has an  \nidea that he wants to convey, but no word for that idea suggests itself. In  \nthat case, one must conjure up some word or some concept (and it was here  \nthat Roget's original topical categories were helpful) that is close to the  \nnotion he wants to convey. Even a remote word will give him a starting  \npoint in the thesaurus. Synonyms for that word and cross-references to other  \nwords will move him closer to the exact word.\n\nThe student in our instance is not sure, however, whether he needs just a  \nsubstitute word or whether he needs an entirely new way of phrasing what  \nhe means to say. But since \"showing off\" is the general idea that he wants  \nto convey with this sentence, he decides to start by consulting the entry osten-  \ntation. In Roget's he finds, as he will in most thesauruses, that the synonyms  \nare grouped under part-of-speech headings—noun, verb, adjective, adverb.  \nLooking at the list of synonyms under each part-of-speech heading may sug-  \ngest to the student how to reword or revise his unsatisfactory sentence. He  \nwould like to keep, if he can, the \"silks and satins and diamonds\" of his  \npresent sentence because these words are concrete and sensory. (Perhaps  \nwithout knowing it, the student has produced the figure of synecdoche—the  \nmaterial here standing for the thing made from it.) From the nouns listed  \nunder ostentation, he experiments with various combinations:\n\nThe ladies made a display (or show, flourish, parade) of their silks  \nand satins and diamonds.\n\nPerhaps adding the adjective vulgar (or garish, gaudy, glittering) would re-  \nveal his value judgment on the scene—would, in other words, reveal his atti-  \ntude toward the scene:\n\nThe ladies made a vulgar display of their silks and satins and dia-  \nmonds.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

    Then he experiments with some verb combinations suggested by the syno-
    nyms listed under ostentation: to exhibit, to display, to parade, to flaunt, to
    prink, to primp. He finally settles on the verb flaunt—

    The ladies flaunted their silks and satins and diamonds.

    —because flaunt combines all the notions and attitudes that he tried to con-
    vey in his original sentence; and flaunt, being concrete and picturesque, fits
    well with the figure of speech that follows it.

    A thesaurus can be a valuable aid when "the proper word in the proper
    place" does not immediately present itself. But the student should be on his
    guard against the temptations offered by such a treasury. Those who have
    gone through a period of serious effort to improve their style may recall how
    difficult it was at times to resist the temptation to replace all the drab, ordi-
    nary words with some of the resplendent, polysyllabic words discovered in a
    thesaurus. A student, for instance, might compose a sentence like this:

    After the fire had been put out, the police roped off the street and
    prevented all sightseers from strolling past the charred ruins.

    But that is too lackluster, he tells himself. So mining his lexicographical
    lode for some sesquipedalian nuggets, he bedizens his humdrum sentence in
    this fashion:

    After the conflagration had been extinguished, the police obstructed
    the thoroughfare and forefended all inquisitive spectators from per-
    ambulating before the incinerated residue of the pyrogenic catas-
    trophe.

    Fortunately, the student who persists in his efforts to improve his style even-
    tually outgrows his penchant for such polysyllabic anfractuosities. Perhaps
    the price that one has to pay for an enriched vocabulary is a period of addic-
    tion to "big" words. The ordeal will inflict no permanent damage if the
    student can "kick the habit" in its early stages.

    So far in our discussion of diction we have touched on two qualifications that the student must have if he is to improve his style: he must know the grammar of his language, and he must have an adequate vocabulary. Our concern from this point on will be mainly with the rhetorical competence that a student must have in order to make wise choices among words. George Campbell pointed up the distinction between grammatical and rhetorical competence in this way: "the grammatical art bears much the same relation to the rhetorical which the art of the mason bears to that of the architect."

    The prime quality of prose style is clarity—or, to use the sonorous Latinate term, perspicuity. Since the object of rhetorical prose is persuasion, it follows that such prose must communicate with those who are to be persuaded. And if rhetorical prose must communicate, it follows that it must, above all, be clear. As one might expect from the man who viewed rhetoric as an activity that always involved an audience, Aristotle held that "language which does not convey a clear meaning fails to perform the very function of language." Lord Macaulay, one of the masters of the limpid prose style, put it this way: "The first rule of all writing—that rule to which every other is subordinate—is that the words used by the writer shall be such as most fully and pre-cisely convey his meaning to the great body of his readers."

    Clarity comes from selecting words carefully and arranging them well. Leaving aside the problem of arrangement for now, how can a writer learn to select the proper words? He will be helped in making his selection by keeping three criteria in mind—purity, propriety, and precision. While some judgments about whether language is pure, appropriate, and precise can be made only when the writer sees words in a sentence and when he views them in relation to his subject, purpose, and audience, it is still possible to say something about the purity, propriety, and precision of isolated words.

'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Clarity Criteria**\n\nA student is writing an essay on the topic "The Importance of Clear Communication in Rhetoric." They are advised to use words that are pure, proper, and precise.\n- **Part A**: Identify one example of a word that might be considered impure in this context, and explain why.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of a word that is improper for the topic and explain why, using the text''s criteria.\n- **Part C**: Choose a precise word that conveys the exact meaning needed for the topic and justify why it is appropriate.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of all three criteria and show how each applies to the essay''s context.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Prose Style**\n\nThe text states that the prime quality of prose style is clarity (perspicuity) and that this is essential for persuasion.\n- **Part A**: Explain why clarity is more important than other qualities like variety or ornamentation in rhetorical prose.\n- **Part B**: Using examples from the text, argue that Aristotle''s statement about language failing to convey meaning is a fundamental principle of effective writing.\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument that supports the idea that "words must be chosen to convey meaning precisely" by referencing at least two of the text''s criteria (purity, propriety, precision).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate concepts from the text and demonstrate a logical understanding of how clarity impacts rhetorical effectiveness.'

    The discussion of purity of diction involves us, willy-nilly, in a consideration of those much-maligned criteria that George Campbell set forth in the eighteenth century to determine "good usage." In order to merit the stamp of approval, words must be, according to Campbell, in reputable use, in national use, and in present use. Despite the relativity of these criteria, there would seem to be little practical difficulty in using at least two of the criteria — national use and present use — to help us determine whether our diction is "pure" and therefore clear. If we are to communicate with a contemporary audience, it stands to reason that we must use current words and idioms — that is, words and idioms, however "old" they may be, that are understood by people today. Likewise, we must use the words which have a national currency. This criterion demands that we avoid dialectical words, technical words, coinages, and foreign words. But this second criterion immediately

    304 STYLE

    calls for some qualification. If we view words in relation to an audience, for instance, we see that there are some situations which call for localisms, technical jargon, neologisms, and even foreign words.

    When we try the third criterion, reputable use, we run into more difficulty. Campbell proposed this standard for judging reputable locutions: "whatever modes of speech are authorized as good by the writings of a great number, if not the majority, of celebrated authors." But is it conceivable that in a modern pluralistic society we could ever arrive at any consensus about who our "celebrated authors" are? Moreover, if two "celebrated authors" are in conflict on a matter of usage, which author do we follow — the one who is more celebrated? And is it possible for the ordinary educated person to determine in every case, or even in many cases, whether a certain locution is sanctioned by a "great number" or "the majority" of celebrated authors?

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Usage Standards**\n\nConsider the following two phrases: \"I would rather be a fool than a sycophant\" and \"I would rather be a fool than a parasite\". Using the text''s discussion of purity of diction and Campbell''s criteria, determine which phrase is more in line with "good usage".\n- **Part A**: Analyze each phrase using the criteria of national use, present use, and reputable use.\n- **Part B**: Explain why one phrase might be considered "more pure" than the other, referencing the text''s discussion of avoiding foreign words and dialectical terms.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s argument about modern pluralism affects the interpretation of "reputable use."\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how Campbell''s criteria apply to contemporary language usage.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Diction and Usage**\n\nThe text raises questions about the consistency of Campbell''s criteria in a modern, pluralistic society. Construct an argument that addresses the following points: \n- **Part A**: Is it possible to determine "reputable use" in a modern society?\n- **Part B**: How might the criteria of "national use" and "present use" conflict in a globalized world?\n- **Part C**: Propose a solution to the problem of determining "good usage" in an era where language is constantly evolving.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of pluralism and the challenges of defining "good usage" in contemporary society.'

    These practical difficulties lead many people to rely on some arbiter of
    usage. The best source of such guidance is a reference work that boldly claims
    to be an arbiter. Fortunately, there are a few esteemed dictionaries of usage
    available. These dictionaries offer reliable guidance because the men or
    women who prepared them had good taste in language to start with and
    refined their taste with a close study of actual usage.

    The most famous of these reference words is H. W. Fowler's A Dictionary
    of Modern English Usage, first published in 1926 but many times reprinted.
    This book has become a bible of usage for many famous writers and editors.
    Fowler was himself a lexicographer, having compiled, with the help of his
    brother Francis George Fowler, The Concise Oxford Dictionary. To his
    sound knowledge of the English language, Fowler added a discriminating
    taste, and he wrote with such grace and wit that he was himself an exemplar
    of the "good English" that he advocated. It was Fowler who assured us,
    once and for all, that it was permissible at times, even advisable, to split an
    infinitive or to end a sentence with a preposition. And he made household
    words of some of the headings in his alphabetically arranged dictionary—tags
    like Battered Ornaments, Cannibalism, Elegant Variation, Out of the Frying
    Pan, Sturdy Indefensibles.

    The student will have to consult A Dictionary of Modern English Usage
    to discover for himself the value and flavor of this admirable reference work.
    But here is a taste of Fowler's wit and judgment, taken from his article on
    the subject we have just been discussing—purity of diction:

    Purism. Now & then a person may be heard to ‘confess', in the pride
    that apes humility, to being ‘a bit of a purist'; but purist & purism arc
    for the most part missile words, which we all of us fling at anyone who
    insults us by finding not good enough for him some manner of speech
    that is good enough for us. It is in that disparaging sense that the words
    are used in this book; by purism is to be understood a needless & irritat-

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nBased on the text''s discussion of purism and usage dictionaries, explain how the concept of ''purity of diction'' relates to the role of reference works like Fowler''s *A Dictionary of Modern English Usage*.\n- **Step 1**: Define ''purity of diction'' according to the text.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how Fowler''s dictionary serves as a counterpoint to purist views.\n- **Step 3**: Use an example from the text (e.g., ''Out of the Frying Pan'') to illustrate how reference works help modern writers navigate linguistic choices.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s critique of purism with its endorsement of practical usage guidelines from reference works.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Language Trends**\n\nThe text mentions that Fowler''s dictionary made ''household words'' of some headings. Choose one of the examples provided (''Battered Ornaments'', ''Cannibalism'', ''Elegant Variation'') and analyze its significance in the context of linguistic evolution.\n- **Part A**: Explain how this heading reflects a shift in language usage or cultural attitudes.\n- **Part B**: Compare it to another heading from the text that represents a similar trend.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how such headings demonstrate the dynamic nature of language as a living entity.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must directly reference the text and demonstrate an understanding of how language evolves through usage examples.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Language Standards**\n\nThe text suggests that purist views are often ''missile words'' used to insult others. Construct an argument that demonstrates how language standards can be both useful and potentially harmful, using the following structure:\n- **Part A**: Present a scenario where adherence to language standards (e.g., from Fowler''s dictionary) is beneficial.\n- **Part B**: Present a scenario where strict adherence to standards can be detrimental.\n- **Part C**: Conclude with a balanced perspective on the role of language standards in modern communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must use examples from the text and demonstrate an ability to critically evaluate the implications of language norms.'

    The insistence on purity or correctness of speech. Pure English, however,
    even apart from the great numbers of elements (vocabulary, grammar,
    idiom, pronunciation, & so forth) that go to make it up, is so relative a
    term that almost every man is potentially a purist & a sloven at once to
    persons looking at him from a lower & a higher position in the scale
    than his own. The words have therefore not been very freely used; that
    they should be renounced altogether would be too much to expect con-
    sidering the subject of the book. But readers who find a usage stigma-
    tized as purism have a right to know the stigmatizer's place in the purist
    scale, if his stigma is not to be valueless. Accordingly, under headings
    of various matters with which purism is concerned, a few articles are
    now mentioned illustrating the kind of view that may be expected in

    other articles of a similar nature: ...

    With the passage of time, Fowler's dictionary was bound to become out-
    dated—at least on some matters of usage. And as the gap between British
    English and American English widened, American writers began to see that
    Fowler was not relevant to some of the locutions that had developed in the
    United States.

    In order to fill the need for an up-to-date dictionary of usage that would
    pay special attention to American English, the Oxford University Press in
    1957 published Margaret Nicholson's A Dictionary of American-English
    Usage. In her Preface, Miss Nicholson announces that her book is an adapta-
    tion of, not a replacement for, Fowler's MEU. She has retained many of
    Fowler's long articles, has abridged others, and has added a number of her
    own entries on modern Americanisms.

    In 1957 Bergen Evans and Cornelia Evans published a completely new
    dictionary of American usage, A Dictionary of Contemporary American
    Usage (Random House). Writers who are loyal to Fowler will continue to
    use due to only in adjectival structures (His absence was due to sickness, but
    not, The government failed due to widespread discontent with its policies).
    But those writers who have come to trust the painstaking study that the
    E-vanses have made of actual usage will probably be guided by this statement
    about the present status of due to:

    due to may be used to qualify a noun, as in a mistake due to carelessness. This use of due to was listed by Dr. Johnson as "proper, but not
    usual." Since then it has become a familiar form of speech and no one
    thinks of objecting to it. But the words are also used today to qualify a
    verb, as in he failed, due to carelessness. This construction is relatively
    new and is condemned by some grammarians.

    In both cases the words due to are being used as owing to might be
    used. It is claimed that due to is acceptable in the first case but not in the
    second, and that only the form owing to may be used with a verb. This
    distinction cannot be defended on theoretical grounds, since due to and
    owing to are grammatically alike. The critics usually content themselves
    with saying that "due to cannot be used to qualify a verb." But it is used
    to qualify a verb, millions of times every day. And it is used in this way
    in very respectable places. A tablet in front of the Old State House in
    Philadelphia reads: Here the Continental Congress sat from the date it
    convened, May 10, 1775, until the close of the Revolution, except when,
    in 1776-77, it sat in Baltimore, and in 1777-78, in Lancaster and York,
    due to the temporary occupation of Philadelphia by the British army.

    Any of the three dictionaries of usage we have discussed would be a valu-
    able addition to the student's library. If the student's dictionary does not
    settle his doubts about the "purity" of a certain expression, a dictionary of
    usage can be of real help to him. He should be cautioned, however, not to
    develop a neurotic concern about usage. If American schools had been as
    much concerned with grammar, logic, and rhetoric, as they have been with
    "good usage," the quality of student writing today might be better than it
    generally is.

    The principal point to be emphasized about purity of diction is that one's
    language must be intelligible and acceptable to an audience. There will
    always be a certain level of diction below which a speaker or writer will never
    slip, however crude and unlettered his audience may be. There is a large
    stock of words, a reservoir of "basic English," that will always be intelligible
    and acceptable to any audience. Deviations from this basic stock of ordinary
    words will be governed mainly by the nature of the audience addressed.

    Propriety or appropriateness is the quality of diction that can least be
    judged in isolation; it always implies a judgment made in relation to some-
    thing else. Conceivably, we could look at isolated words and make some
    judgment about whether they were current or national or reputable, but it
    is impossible to judge the appropriateness of isolated words.

    Diction is appropriate when it suits our subject matter, our purpose, the
    occasion, and the audience. Unfortunately, there are no handbooks that can
    help the student make judgments about the appropriateness of his diction.
    Everyone seems to be endowed with a certain minimal sense of appropriate
    ness—a sense absorbed from the experience of living in a society. Instinc
    tively, we "tone up" our everyday language when we shift from a situation
    in which we are addressing our peers and intimates to a situation in which
    we are addressing, say, the dean of the college. We make similar adjustments
    in our diction as our subject matter, occasion, and purpose change.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Diction and Audience Appropriateness**\n\nA student writing an academic paper about the history of rhetoric is deciding between using the word ''oratory'' and ''speech.'' Which term is more appropriate for the context, and why?\n- **Step 1**: Analyze the subject matter of the paper (history of rhetoric).\n- **Step 2**: Consider the audience (academic scholars familiar with classical rhetoric).\n- **Step 3**: Apply the principle that diction must suit the subject, purpose, occasion, and audience.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly connect the choice of diction to the appropriate use of language in academic contexts, citing the text''s emphasis on diction as a function of context.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Judgment of Diction in Isolation vs. Context**\n\nIs the word ''neurotic'' appropriate for a speech on the importance of clarity in academic writing? Why or why not, based on the text''s discussion of propriety and appropriateness?\n- **Step 1**: Recall the text''s assertion that propriety cannot be judged in isolation.\n- **Step 2**: Consider the context of a speech on clarity and academic writing.\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate whether ''neurotic'' aligns with the audience''s expectations for diction in this context.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how diction is judged in relation to its context, not in isolation, as discussed in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Diction and Audience**\n\nA student is writing a persuasive essay about the benefits of using dictionaries in education. He plans to address both students and educators. Which words would be more appropriate for each group, and why?\n- **Part A**: Choose 2 words suitable for students. \n- **Part B**: Choose 2 words suitable for educators.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the choice of diction reflects the text''s principle that language must be intelligible and appropriate to the audience.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of how diction adapts to different audiences, as outlined in the text.'

    The refinements of this minimal sense of appropriateness will come naturally, as our experience deepens and our education advances, and will develop in proportion to our native intelligence and our conscious efforts to improve this sense. Just as certain people seem to inherit and develop a superior ability to get along with their fellow men, so some of them develop a keener sense than others for the appropriateness of their language.

    Involved in this matter of appropriateness are the connotations of words. When we are concerned with the purity or precision of diction, we are concerned mainly with the denotations of words—with the dictionary meanings of verbal symbols. But in our choice of appropriate diction we must also take into consideration the connotations of words—those emotional and tonal qualities that come to be associated with words. We cannot control the connotations that cluster around a word; we can only be aware of those connotations and take advantage of them. It makes a great difference whether we call a man a "politician" or a "statesman." Because of the connotations that attend these words, the first word will tend, with most audiences, to dishonor the man, while the second word will tend to honor him.

    The connotations of words have great rhetorical value—for example, in promoting the emotional appeal of a discourse. Robert H. Thouless has ably demonstrated the emotional value of connotations in his analysis of the diction in two verses by John Keats:

    In The Eve of St. Agnes, Keats has written:

    Full on this casement shone the wintry moon,
    And threw warm gules on Madeline's fair breast.

    These are beautiful lines. Let us notice how much of their beauty follows from the proper choice of emotionally colored words and how completely it is lost if these words are replaced by neutral ones. The words with strikingly emotional meanings are casement, gules, Madeline, fair, and breast. Casement means simply a kind of window with emotional and romantic associations. Gules is the heraldic name for red, with the suggestion of romance which accompanies all heraldry. Madeline is simply a girl's name, but one calling out favorable emotions absent from a relatively plain and straightforward name. Fair simply means, in objective fact, that her skin was white or uncolored—a necessary condition for the colors of the window to show—but also fair implies warm emotional preference for an uncolored skin rather than one which is yellow, purple, black, or any of the other colors which skin might be. Breast has also similar emotional meanings, and the aim of scientific description might have been equally well attained if it had been replaced by such a neutral word as chest.

    398 STYLE

    Let us now try the experiment of keeping these two lines in a metrical form, but replacing all the emotionally colored words by neutral ones, while making as few other changes as possible. We may write:

    Full on this window shone the wintry moon
    Making red marks on Jane's uncolored chest.

    No one will doubt that all of its poetic value has been knocked out of the passage by these changes. Yet the lines still mean the same in external fact; they still have the same objective meaning. It is only the emotional meaning which has been destroyed.

    The student is probably well aware by now that poets exploit the emotional values of words, but he is not always alert to the subtle emotional effects exerted by connotation in a prose text. Faced with the evidence of H. L. Mencken's scholarly three-volume study of American English, we have to concede that he had a profound knowledge of his native language, but perhaps we are not sufficiently aware of how he manipulated the connotations of words to effect his rhetorical purpose. Consider this example, in which Mencken is seeking to influence our attitude toward a certain kind of teacher:

    Such idiots, despite the rise of "scientific" pedagogy, have not died out in the world. I believe that our schools are full of them, both in pants and in skirts. There are fanatics who love and venerate spelling as a tom-cat loves and venerates catnip. There are grammatomaniacs; school-marm who would rather parse than eat; specialists in an objective case that doesn't exist in English; strange beings, otherwise sane and even intelligent and comely, who suffer under a split infinitive as you or I would suffer under gastro-enteritis. There are geography cranks, able to bound Mesopotamia and Baluchistan. There are zealots for long division, experts in the multiplication table, lunatic worshipers of the binomial theorem. But the system has them in its grip. It combats their natural enthusiasm diligently and mercilessly. It tries to convert them into mere technicians, clumsy machines.

    We cannot examine all the techniques that Mencken uses in his satirical writings, but we can note here the subtle way in which he influences our reactions simply by his choice of words. A good deal of the effect of this passage is produced by Mencken's "name-calling." The "names" that Mencken used here are heavily freighted with emotional overtones—zealots, fanatics, schoolmarms (one of Mencken's favorite derogatory epithets), cranks, zealots, lunatic worshipers. All of these words carry the discrediting connotation of extreme, irrational commitment to a cause—the taint of "enthusiasm" that many critics ascribed to the evangelical sects in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century England. Where Mencken fails to find an emotional epithet to suit his purpose, he invents one—grammatomaniacs. Most readers do not know what gastro-enteritis means; but they do not have to know—the word just sounds awful. Notice how Mencken, in the second sentence of this passage, indicates that he is talking about both men and women teachers—"in panta-lons and in skirts." Pantaloons was an especially clever choice. Pants would have been the word that most of us would have chosen as the counterpart of skirts. But Mencken detected the extra connotative value of the word pantaloons, suggesting to a modern audience something archaic, slightly feminine. Note too how Mencken uses a simile in the third sentence to depreciate the object of his satire, comparing devotees of correct spelling to the lowly, back-alley tom-cat. One of the deadliest words in the English language is the word mere. Mencken uses this word with devastating effectiveness at the end of this passage, where he begins to shift his ground of attack, warning us that these "enthusiastic" pedagogues are now in danger of being turned into dispassionate machines as a result of their exposure to "teachers' college" bunkum. What is more chilling than to be called a "mere technician"?

    We see then that the connotations of words must be considered in any
    judgment about the appropriateness of diction. Sensitivity to the connotations
    of words cannot be taught; it must be learned. What is even harder for the
    student to acquire is a fine sense for knowing how far to go in exploiting
    the emotional force of connotations. Mencken perhaps goes too far in the
    passage we have just considered. In most of his satirical writings, he relied
    too heavily on the shock technique that derived from the use of hyperbolic,
    simplistic diction. Many people are alienated rather than persuaded by his
    intemperate language. A clever writer can sometimes be too clever for his
    own good. It does not take a sledge-hammer to drive a nail.

    We turn now to the third quality, precision. The word precision has its roots
    in the Latin verb praecidere, "to cut off." A precise word is a word shorn
    of all superfluous and irrelevant notions, a word that signifies neither more
    nor less than we intend to say. Words may be dubbed "imprecise" (1) when
    they do not express exactly what we intended to say; (2) when they express
    the idea but not quite fully; (3) when they express the idea but with some-
    thing more than we intended.

    The student who writes, "I was pleased by his fulsome praise," has not
    said what he intended to say. If he consults the dictionary meaning of ful-
    some ("disgusting or offensive, mainly because of its excessiveness or insin-
    cerity"), he will see how wide of the mark he has come. If he writes, "I
    thought it was a tremendous performance," he conveys the general idea that

    he approved of the performance, but he conveys no exact notion of the particular way in which this performance was "tremendous." When he writes, "As a result of examining the basic flaws in the situation, he came up with a radical solution to the problem," he chooses an apt word in radical (a solution that gets at the root of the problem), but unwittingly he suggests an additional meaning that he did not intend (a solution that is wild or subversive). A word then will be inexact if it expresses too little or too much or if it is too general.

    It is perhaps better to discuss faulty idiom here than under the head of pure diction, because, like the diction cited in the previous paragraph, faulty idiom "misses the mark." The reason why lapses in idiom constitute one of the commonest faults in student writing is that idiom, like connotation, is one of the tricky aspects of language. Dictionaries and handbooks of usage will more often be helpful to the student in matters of idiom than in matters of connotation, but the most reliable guide to correct idiom is the student's own awareness of how his native language is spoken. The student who has not read very much or who has not kept his ears open to the turns of phrase is the one most likely to violate the idiom of the language.

    The "turns of phrase" in the previous sentence suggests an important observation about idiom. No single word, considered in isolation, can be declared unidiomatic. If we say of a certain word, "Native speakers of the language do not use that word," we are saying simply that such a word does not exist in the English language. A word can be classified as unidiomatic only in relation to some other word or words. No one could say of the word for that it is unidiomatic; either it is an English word or it is not. For can become unidiomatic only when it is used in conjunction with another word, as with the word unequal, in the sentence, "The judge proved to be unequal for the task." Then we can point out that native speakers of the language do not use the preposition for with unequal; they say "unequal to the task."

    What complicates the difficulty is that grammar is of no help to the student in deciding matters of idiom. There is nothing ungrammatical in the locution "unequal for the task." Idiom is a matter of usage rather than of grammar: native speakers just do not say "unequal for." Neither is logic of much help to the student in regard to idiom. When we say, for instance, "He looked up the word in the dictionary," we are, in a sense, violating logic, because when we consult a word in the dictionary, we are more likely to look down the page to find the word than to look up the page. But "look up a word" is the correct idiom simply because that is the way people say it.

    Sometimes the prefixes of words will provide a clue to the idiomatic preposition that goes with those words. So we say, "he departed from the scene," "the crowd emerged from the stadium," "he is adverse to the proposal," "they compared it with the first version," "the station-wagon collided with the motorcycle," "he abstained from all alcoholic beverages." But the lexical meaning of these Latin prefixes is not always a clue to the proper preposition, for we also say, "in contrast to" (as well as "in contrast with"), "he departed for the station," "she compared him to an overgrown bear."

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Idiomatic Preposition Clues in Prefixes\n\nExplain how the prefixes of certain words can provide clues to the idiomatic prepositions that are commonly used with them. Use examples from the text, such as "departed from the scene" and "compared it with the first version."\n- **Step 1**: Identify the prefixes in these examples and explain their possible Latin origins.\n- **Step 2**: Discuss how the lexical meanings of these prefixes may or may not align with their usage in idiomatic prepositions.\n- **Step 3**: Create an original example using a word with a recognizable prefix that is commonly used with a specific idiomatic preposition.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concept of prefixes as potential clues for idiomatic prepositions and demonstrate an understanding of how lexical meaning may not always correspond to idiom.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Logical vs. Idiomatic Interpretation\n\nConsider the statement: "He looked up the word in the dictionary."\n- **Part A**: Explain why this statement is considered an idiom, even though it seems to violate logical expectations (e.g., looking up a word would mean looking at the top of a page).\n- **Part B**: Compare this idiom to another example given in the text, such as "in contrast to" or "compared him to an overgrown bear." Discuss how the meaning of the idiom can be determined through usage rather than logic.\n- **Part C**: Propose a new idiom that is based on a common action but contradicts logical expectations. Justify why it is considered an idiom rather than a literal description.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the difference between logical interpretation and idiomatic usage, using examples from the text.

- prompt: |-
    In our own terms, the purity, propriety, and precision of diction—can best be made when we view diction in the context of a sentence and in relation to our rhetorical purpose. There will be times, for instance, when it might suit our purpose to make our diction awkward or insipid or abstract or ugly or unmusical.

    In summary: Since words are the building-blocks of our sentences, it is obvious that we must have an adequate supply of words to erect the kind of edifice we have planned. When our supply of words is low, we will have to make some effort to add to our stock. Our working vocabulary will naturally expand as our experience and education expand, but we can accelerate the expansion by reading a great deal and by consulting dictionaries and thesauruses. Since we seek to communicate with others, it stands to reason that our diction must first of all be intelligible—intelligible, that is, to a particular audience. It will be mainly the audience that will determine whether we can use learned words or technical terms or foreign words or slang. The audience, the subject matter, the occasion, and our purpose constitute the criteria for judging the appropriateness of our diction. In addition to choosing intelligible and appropriate diction, we must choose diction that is as precise as the situation permits and demands. Dictionaries and handbooks of usage will help solve some of the student's problems with usage, idiom, and connotation, but the student will have to depend mainly on the development of his own sensitivity to these aspects of language.

    Words are symbols of ideas, but they do not begin to "say" anything until
    we put them together. Sentences, which are syntactical units composed of
    words, "say" something, partly because of the lexical content (the meaning)
    of the words and partly because of the grammatical forms that govern words
    put together in patterns. Up to this point, we have been speaking mainly
    about the lexical aspect of words. As we move now to a discussion of the
    composition of the sentence, we must begin to be concerned with syntax.
    Eventually, we will be led into a discussion of another aspect of language:
    how the rhetorical forms of sentences, the schemes, constitute a third carrier
    of meaning.

    As we pointed out in the previous section on choice of diction, no one can
    begin to develop a style until he has a basic competence in the grammar of
    the language. We presume that the student has this basic competence and is
    thus ready to develop the rhetorical competence he needs in order to compose
    effective sentences.

    COMPOSITION OF THE SENTENCE 403

    Rhetorical competence plays its part in the writing process when there are
    choices to be made from among two or more grammatical possibilities. Sty-
    listic variations in the syntax of the sentence cannot ignore the grammar of
    the language. Any changes we make for rhetorical effect must respect the
    grammatical possibilities of the language.

    As a starting point for our discussion of the rhetoric of the sentence, let us
    take this minimal sentence:

    The boy loves the girl.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Composition and Rhetorical Purpose**\n\nGiven the sentence ''The boy loves the girl,'' analyze how changes in syntax can affect rhetorical effect while maintaining grammatical correctness.\n- **Step 1**: Consider at least two alternative syntactic structures (e.g., passive voice, different word order) that could be used to rephrase the sentence.\n- **Step 2**: For each alternative, explain how it alters the rhetorical tone (e.g., formality, emphasis) without violating grammatical rules.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a comparison of the original and altered sentences in terms of their rhetorical effectiveness.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of both syntax and rhetoric, using examples from the text to support your reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Schemes in Sentence Construction**\n\nUsing the concept that rhetorical schemes constitute a third carrier of meaning, compose a sentence with three distinct rhetorical devices.\n- **Part A**: Identify and explain two of the following schemes: anaphora, antithesis, parallelism, and metaphor.\n- **Part B**: Construct a sentence that incorporates both schemes you have identified, ensuring that each device contributes to the overall rhetorical effect.\n- **Part C**: Analyze how this sentence uses these schemes to convey a specific message or emotion, referencing the text''s discussion of rhetorical forms.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference at least two rhetorical schemes and demonstrate an understanding of their role in conveying meaning.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Grammatical and Rhetorical Principles**\n\nThe text emphasizes that stylistic variations in syntax must respect grammatical possibilities. Using the sentence ''The boy loves the girl,'' construct an argument that demonstrates how a grammatically incorrect sentence could mislead readers about rhetorical intent.\n- **Part A**: Create a grammatically incorrect sentence that is semantically similar to the original.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the grammatical error affects the reader''s interpretation of the sentence''s rhetorical purpose.\n- **Part C**: Connect this to the text''s assertion that ''any changes we make for rhetorical effect must respect the grammar of the language.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must show a clear understanding of both grammatical correctness and rhetorical intent, using the example to illustrate how they are interrelated.'

    Native speakers of the language recognize this as a pattern of words that
    make a statement. They know the meanings of the words, and they are
    familiar with the grammar of the sentence: the function word the, the inflec-
    tional concordance between the subject and predicate, and the word order.
    Anyone who wanted to make a statement, in the English language, about
    a young male of the human species having a certain emotional attitude
    toward a young female of the human species would be limited in the words
    he could choose to express this idea and even more severely limited in the
    way he could put these words together to say what he wanted to say. As far
    as rhetoric goes, there is very little he could do with this sentence. He might
    make some different choice of words—proper nouns to replace the boy and
    girl or a synonymous verb to replace Joves—to make the sentence rhetorically
    more effective. But there is almost nothing he could do to alter the grammar
    of the sentence. He cannot say "Boy love girl" or "Loves the boy the girl."
    No, he must dispose whatever words he chooses in the usual pattern for a
    statement—subject-verb-complement (S-V-C)—and use the proper inflec-
    tional forms.

    It is when we begin to expand this minimal sentence pattern that rhetoric
    has a bearing. There are a number of ways in which we can expand this sen-
    tence, and within each of the various ways there are often alternatives. Once
    there are alternatives, there are choices to be made; and once choices are to
    be made, rhetoric comes into the picture.

    One of the ways in which we can expand our minimal sentence is by add-
    ing single-word, phrasal, or clausal modifiers to the head word in the S or V
    or C. For instance:

    The tall, handsome boy sincerely loves the short, homely girl.

    Can we alter the order of any of these modifiers? Yes, we can make some
    changes—changes that are grammatically and idiomatically possible but not
    always stylistically advisable. For example, we could make these changes:

    The boy, tall and handsome, loves sincerely the short, homely girl.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structure and Rhetorical Choice**\n\nGiven the minimal sentence pattern "The boy loves the girl," expand and modify it to create a more rhetorically effective sentence.\n- **Step 1**: Add at least two single-word modifiers to the subject ("The [modifier] boy") and one phrasal modifier to the predicate ("loves [phrasal modifier] ").\n- **Step 2**: Rearrange the modifiers according to grammatical and idiomatic rules, ensuring the sentence remains coherent.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how your changes demonstrate rhetorical effectiveness, referencing the text''s discussion of stylistic choices and grammatical constraints.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must be grammatically correct, and your explanation must explicitly link rhetorical choices to the text''s ideas on sentence structure.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Rhetorical Alternatives**\n\nConsider the sentence "The tall, handsome boy sincerely loves the short, homely girl."\n- **Part A**: Identify three alternative ways to modify this sentence by changing the order of modifiers, as discussed in the text.\n- **Part B**: For each alternative, explain why one arrangement is stylistically preferable to others, citing specific examples from the text.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the text''s emphasis on grammatical constraints influences rhetorical decisions, using your examples to support your argument.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of modifier order and rhetorical effectiveness as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Sentence Expansion**\n\nThe text discusses how expanding a minimal sentence allows for rhetorical variation. Construct an argument that demonstrates the following:\n- **Part A**: The minimal sentence "The boy loves the girl" is a grammatically constrained structure.\n- **Part B**: Expanding this sentence introduces stylistic choices but also increases the risk of grammatical inconsistency.\n- **Part C**: Rhetoric is necessary to navigate these choices and maintain clarity.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be logically structured, referencing the text''s discussion of sentence structure and rhetorical effectiveness. Your reasoning must connect grammatical constraints to rhetorical decisions without referencing external material.'

    Rarely does one see adjectival single-word modifiers placed after the head
    word in the complement: ... sincerely loves the girl, short and homely. The
    following order is also possible in English:

    Tall and handsome, the boy loves the short, homely girl sincerely.

    We might choose this order, for instance, if we wanted to emphasize the
    boy's tallness and handsomeness and the sincerity of his love for the girl.

    Another way to expand the minimal sentence is to use prepositional phrases
    as modifiers of any one or all of the head words in the S-V-C pattern:

    The boy from Montana loves, with uncommon fervor, the girl from
    Missouri.

    Prepositional phrases used as adjectival modifiers are almost always placed
    after the noun or pronoun they modify. There are some instances, however,
    when the prepositional phrase used adjectivally will be placed before the
    noun that it modifies. For example,

    About this development, he had been given no advance warning.

    (Here the phrase about this development modifies warning.)

    Prepositional phrases used adverbially have more freedom of movement
    than do prepositional phrases used adjectivally. There are three other places
    where the phrase with uncommon fervor could be placed in our sentence:

    With uncommon fervor, the boy from Montana loves the girl from
    Missouri.

    The boy from Montana loves the girl from Missouri with uncom-
    mon fervor.

    The boy from Montana with uncommon fervor loves the girl from
    Missouri.

    There are a number of other ways in which we could expand our minimal
    sentence:

    1. compounding the head words in the S-V-C pattern;

    2. juxtaposing appositives to the head words in the S-V-C pattern;

    3. using verbals or verbal phrases (participles, gerunds, and infini-
    tives) in the S-V-C pattern;

    4. using noun clauses to serve as the S or the C in the S-V-C pattern;

    5. using adjective clauses to modify the S or C head word in the
    S-V-C pattern;

    6. using adverb clauses to modify the V in the S-V-C pattern.

    We could go on to illustrate these methods of expanding the sentence and
    to investigate the alternatives (if any) in word order of each of these meth-

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Expansion Techniques**\n\nUsing the information in the text, describe how you would expand the minimal sentence "The boy from Montana loves the girl from Missouri" using at least three of the six methods listed (compounding, juxtaposing appositives, verbals, noun clauses, adjective clauses, adverb clauses).\n- **Step 1**: Choose three expansion techniques from the list.\n- **Step 2**: For each technique, provide a concrete example of how it would be applied to the original sentence.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your choices by referencing specific examples from the text (e.g., "The text explains that...").\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the six methods and correctly apply at least three to the given sentence.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Prepositional Phrases**\n\nThe text discusses the placement of prepositional phrases used adjectivally versus adverbially. Using this information, answer the following questions:\n- **Part A**: Explain the difference in placement rules between adjectival and adverbial prepositional phrases. Provide an example from the text to illustrate this difference.\n- **Part B**: Given the sentence "With uncommon fervor, the boy from Montana loves the girl from Missouri," explain why the phrase with uncommon fervor can be placed in three different positions within the sentence. Use the text''s explanation of prepositional phrase flexibility to support your answer.\n- **Part C**: Construct a sentence that uses an adjectival prepositional phrase placed before the noun it modifies, and another sentence that uses an adverbial prepositional phrase in a flexible position.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference the text''s discussion of prepositional phrase placement and demonstrate an understanding of both adjectival and adverbial usage.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Sentence Structure**\n\nThe text describes various methods to expand a sentence, including the use of verbals and noun clauses. Using this information, create an original sentence that incorporates at least two different expansion techniques (e.g., a verbal phrase and a noun clause).\n- **Step 1**: Choose two expansion techniques from the list (e.g., verbals, noun clauses).\n- **Step 2**: Construct a sentence that integrates both techniques.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your choice of techniques by referencing specific examples from the text (e.g., "The text explains that...").\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must be grammatically correct and demonstrate a clear application of at least two distinct expansion methods described in the text.'

    ods, but the student can pursue these matters in the structural and transfor-
    mational grammars now available. This brief excursion into the syntax of
    the English sentence serves to give a general idea of what we mean by the
    rhetoric of the sentence.

    When we are presented with a number of syntactical choices, all of them
    grammatically and idiomatically possible, we will elect the possibility that
    best serves our purpose at the moment. If, for instance, one of the possibilities
    allows us to put a word or phrase in an emphatic position and if emphasis
    of that word or phrase is what we want at that point, then we should take
    advantage of that possibility. There are times when we want to de-emphasize
    a word or phrase, and in that case we should elect that possibility which
    would bury the word or phrase somewhere in the interior of the sentence.
    We might elect another grammatical possibility on the grounds that this dis-
    position of words improved the rhythm of the sentence. Sometimes we might
    reject a grammatical possibility because it lends itself to ambiguity. (Such a
    case would be the "squinting modifier" in the sentence "The bandmaster
    strutted along gaily twirling his baton.") And of course we sometimes elect
    a grammatical possibility for no other reason than that we want to avoid
    monotony of sentence structure.

    There is another point to be made here about the rhetoric of the sentence.
    Style, like grammar, is part of the expressive system of a language. Just as
    grammatical devices, like word order and inflections, are carriers of mean-
    ing, so the forms of sentence—the schemes, as the Renaissance rhetoricians
    called them—are expressive of meaning too. For example, let us consider the
    rhetorical device of parallelism. When we have to express a series of similar
    or equivalent "meanings," we usually resort to the grammatical device of
    compounding, and we reinforce the co-ordinate value of the compounded
    elements with the rhetorical device of parallelism.

    We can illustrate how parallelism can be expressive of meaning by looking
    at a sentence in which it is a pronounced feature:

    406 STYLE

    This is an unusually long sentence, but it is so well articulated that it con-
    veys its meaning clearly. The expansion, all of which takes place in the com-
    plement part of the sentence, is managed with a series of parallel structures.
    The student could learn the whole art of parallelism from a close study of
    this remarkable sentence. An analysis of the sentence reveals several levels of
    parallelism and enough variation in the basic pattern to break an otherwise
    monotonous rhythm. The basic pattern is this:

    indefinite article noun prepositional phrase
    a friend of the students
    a _ colleague of the faculty

    Dr. Kerr varies the rhythm of this basic pattern in several ways: (1) by in-
    troducing an adjective before the noun ("a good fellow with the alumni"); (2) by throwing in an adverb ("a champion generally"); (3) by inserting a
    parenthesis ("particularly law and medicine"); (4) by compounding the
    objects of the preposition ("a friend of industry, labor, and agriculture") or
    by compounding the adjectives modifying the object of the preposition ("a
    public servant at the state and national levels").

    The main point that we want to make about this sentence, however, is that the rhetorical form is one of the carriers of meaning. The theme of Dr. Kerr's essay is that the modern university has become so huge and complex that it can no longer be regarded as a university but must be regarded now as a multiversity. The point he is making in the section of the essay from which the above sentence was taken is that the president of such a multiversity must wear many hats, must be many things to many people. In this sentence he is enumerating some of the capacities in which the president is expected to serve, using a series of phrases. This compounding (without conjunctions, for the most part) is one of the expressive devices for indicating the variety of roles the president must play. But because Dr. Kerr also wants to indicate that the president is expected to play each of these roles equally well he uses the device of parallelism, which serves to reinforce the co-ordinate value of these several capacities. Dr. Kerr does not expect his reader to remember all these roles; he wants only to convey the general impression of the heavy burden that the president carries. Incidentally, the length of the sentence has a rhetorical function too: the long cataloguing is weighty and exhausting to the reader, as the job is to the president.

    In the next sentence but one, Dr. Kerr makes use of antithesis, another rhetorical device, to convey the notion of the contrary qualities that the president must combine in his personality. Here is that sentence of 114 words:

    He should be firm, yet gentle; sensitive to others, insensitive to himself; look to the past and the future, yet be firmly planted in the present, both visionary and sound; affable, yet reflective; know the value of a dollar and realize that ideas cannot be bought; inspiring in his visions yet cautious in what he does; a man of principle yet able to make a deal; a man with broad perspective who will follow the details conscientiously; a good American but ready to criticize the status quo fearlessly; a seeker of truth where the truth may not hurt too much; a source of public pronouncements when they do not reflect on his own institution.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Rhetorical Devices in Dr. Kerr''s Essay**\n\nDr. Kerr uses a series of rhetorical devices to convey the complexity of the university president''s role. In the sentence where he lists the president''s capacities, identify and explain **two** rhetorical devices used to emphasize the variety of roles the president must fulfill. Specifically,\n- **Part A**: Explain how the use of compounding (without conjunctions) contributes to the overall message.\n- **Part B**: Describe how parallelism reinforces the president''s equal ability to perform all these roles.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text and demonstrate an understanding of how these devices work together to convey the burden and complexity of the role.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Interpretation of Antithesis in Dr. Kerr''s Essay**\n\nIn the sentence where Dr. Kerr lists contrasting qualities of the president, identify **three** pairs of antithetical phrases and explain how each pair highlights a duality in the president''s character. Specifically,\n- **Part A**: Analyze the contrast between "firm, yet gentle" and how it reflects the balance needed in leadership.\n- **Part B**: Examine the contrast between "visionary and sound" and discuss its significance in a university setting.\n- **Part C**: Explain the contrast between "a good American but ready to criticize the status quo fearlessly" and how it demonstrates a tension between national loyalty and critical thinking.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly demonstrate an understanding of antithesis and how it contributes to the essay''s central theme.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Strategy in Dr. Kerr''s Essay**\n\nDr. Kerr uses a combination of rhetorical devices to convey the president''s heavy burden and multifaceted role. Synthesize **two** of these devices and explain how they work together to achieve the essay''s purpose. Specifically,\n- **Part A**: Explain how the long, compound sentence with multiple roles serves to mimic the weight of the president''s responsibilities.\n- **Part B**: Describe how antithesis in the later sentence contributes to the idea of balancing opposing qualities in leadership.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the analysis of rhetorical devices and show how they collectively support Dr. Kerr''s argument about the multiversity.'

    The various levels of parallelism and antithesis in this sentence look like this
    when laid out schematically:

    He should be firm / yet gentle

    sensitive / insensitive
    to others to himself
    look / yet be firmly planted
    to the past and the future in the present

    both visionary / and sound
    affable / yet reflective
    know the value of a dollar / and realize the ideas cannot be bought

    inspiring / yet cautious
    in his visions in what he does
    a man / yet able
    of principle to make a deal

    (antithesis persists, but parallelism is violated: a noun,
    man, yoked with an adjective, able; man modified by
    prepositional phrase but able modified by infinitive
    phrase )

    a man
    with broad perspective
    who will follow the details conscientiously

    (again the antithesis is in the words—broad perspective /
    details—rather than in the structure)

    a good American / but ready
    to criticize the status quo fear-
    lessly

    (departure from parallelism again)

    a seeker
    of truth
    where the truth may not hurt too much

    a source
    of public pronouncements
    when they do not reflect on his own institution

    408 STYLE

    As we shall make clear when we come to discuss the figures of speech, the
    rhetoricians commonly associated the various schemes and tropes with the
    topics of logos, pathos, and éthos. Antithesis, for instance, was tied up with
    the topic of dissimilarity or with the topic of contraries. In the third book
    of his Rhetoric, Aristotle pointed out the value of antithesis in discourse:
    "Such a form of speech is satisfying, because of the significance of contrasted
    ideas is easily felt, especially when they are thus put side by side." Whether
    Dr. Kerr was aware of the theory of antithesis is immaterial. What is impor-
    tant is that by putting his "contrasted ideas" in juxtaposition, he has assisted
    the communication of his meaning.

    Up to this point we have been concentrating on only a few stylistic features — word order, methods of expansion, parallelism, antithesis. It is time now to consider a broader range of stylistic features, not only so that we can get to know what these various features are and how they function but so that we can derive the maximum benefit from the exercises in imitation later on in the chapter and can incorporate some of these features into our own style.

    Study of Style

    Before the student can benefit from a close observation of stylistic features, he must have some technique for analyzing prose style. Because the modern student has spent so little time analyzing prose style, he may be ignorant of what to look for in sentences and paragraphs. He has undoubtedly been im-
    pressed by the style of certain prose writers, but he is almost tongue-tied
    when asked to point out what it is he particularly admires about their style.
    The best he can do is to characterize various styles with such general, sub-
    jective epithets as "clear," "crisp," "urbane," "orotund," "whimsical," "heavy,"
    "flowing," "staccato." The New Criticism has given the student a technique
    and a terminology for analyzing poetry, but most students do not know
    where to begin if they are asked to analyze the style of a piece of prose.

    First, let us set down, in outline form a list of features that one can look
    for when analyzing prose style.

    A. Kind of diction
    1. general or specific
    2. abstract or concrete
    3. formal or informal
    4. Latinate (usually polysyllabic) or Anglo-Saxon (usually
    monosyllabic)
    5. common words or jargon
    6. referential (denotative) or emotive (connotative)

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Stylistic Features in Prose**\n\nUsing the list of features provided, analyze a short paragraph from a known prose writer (e.g., Orwell, Emerson, or Hemingway) and identify at least three stylistic features from the list. For each feature, explain how it contributes to the overall style and tone of the paragraph.\n- **Task**: Select a passage with clear stylistic variation and demonstrate your ability to identify specific features.\n- **Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must explicitly reference at least three elements from the list (e.g., ''diction is concrete and specific'') and explain their stylistic function.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Stylistic Analysis in Imitation**\n\nImagine you are to imitate the style of a prose writer (e.g., Orwell, Emerson, or Hemingway) for a short paragraph. Based on the features listed in the text, create your own paragraph that incorporates at least three stylistic elements from the list.\n- **Task**: Your imitation must reflect a specific style (e.g., ''formal, Latinate diction'' or ''concrete, concrete imagery'').\n- **Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must be original and demonstrate an understanding of how each chosen feature affects the overall tone and effect.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Stylistic Categories**\n\nCompare and contrast two different prose styles using the features listed in the text. For example, compare the style of a ''formal, Latinate'' writer with that of an ''informal, Anglo-Saxon'' writer.\n- **Task**: Identify at least three features from the list and explain how they differentiate the two styles.\n- **Answer Requirement**: Your comparison must be analytical, showing how each feature contributes to the distinctiveness of the writer''s style and tone.'

- prompt: "The kind of diction that a writer habitually uses can tell us a great deal  \nabout the quality of his mind and the quality of his style. We made the point  \nearlier that a writer must be in command of several styles, so that he can  \naccommodate his manner to various subject matters, occasions, purposes, and  \naudiences. But even within this range of styles, there will be a certain per-  \nsistent level of style associated with that author. Dr. Johnson and Oliver  \nGoldsmith displayed their versatility by trying their hands at several literary  \ngenres, but whether they were writing poems or plays or novels or familiar  \nessays or critical essays, they maintained a certain note that identified the  \nstyle as their own and no one else's. That peculiar note was achieved partly  \nby the kind of diction they used: Johnson's philosophical, polysyllabic, Latin-  \nate diction; Goldsmith's concrete, familiar, colloquial diction. The \"weight\"  \nof a man's style can be measured partly by the syllabic composition of his  \n4IO STYLE  \n\nwords. The \"tone\" of his style can be measured partly by the texture of his  \nwords—their phonic values, their relative abstractness or concreteness, their  \nlevel of usage.

    Some very interesting observations can be made about a man's style and his habits of thought by studying the kinds of sentences he used and the proportions in which he used the various kinds. W. K. Wimsatt, for instance, in his valuable study The Prose Style of Samuel Johnson, saw in Dr. Johnson's persistent use of parallel and antithetical clauses a reflection of the bent of his mind: "Johnson's prose style is a formal exaggeration—in places a caricature—of a certain pair of complementary drives, the drive to assimilate ideas, and the drive to distinguish them—to collect and to separate." And so Dr. Johnson disposed his collection of ideas in parallel structures; he reinforced the distinctions in ideas by juxtaposing them in antithetical structures.

    The history of the prose style of most Western languages reveals a gradual evolution from a paratactic syntax—stringing together a series of co-ordinate structures without conjunctions—to the most sophisticated of sentence patterns, subordination. In Anglo-Saxon, for instance—the earliest extant record of the English language—we note the lack of the relative pronoun and the subordinating conjunction, two of the grammatical devices by which Modern English renders clauses dependent. When we catalogue the kinds of grammatical sentences found in modern professional prose, we find surprisingly few compound sentences. Modern writers expand their sentences more by subordination and apposition than by compounding. Observation of the grammatical kinds of sentences can tell us a great deal about someone's prose style and can point up significant deficiencies in our own prose style.

    A study of variety in sentence patterns also has some valuable lessons to teach us about style. For one thing, such a study can dispel many of the myths about prose style. It is true that professional writers command a greater variety of lexical and syntactical resources than unpracticed writers do, but they do not make a fetish of variety for its own sake. Professor Francis Christensen made a study, for instance, of sentence-openers in the first two hundred sentences of some narrative and expository works written by mod-ern American writers.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Opener Analysis**\n\nUsing the data from Christensen''s study, calculate the percentage of expository openers that are co-ordinated sentences in the combined data set.\n- **Step 1**: Sum the total number of co-ordinated sentences across all works.\n- **Step 2**: Determine the total number of sentence openers in the study.\n- **Step 3**: Apply the percentage formula: (coordinated sentences / total openers) * 100.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your final percentage must be accurate, and you must reference the table''s data to justify your calculation.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Sentence Opener Patterns**\n\nCompare the distribution of sentence openers in the expository texts with those in narrative texts (implied by the study''s focus on ''narrative and expository works'').\n- **Part A**: Identify the primary sentence opener type in expository writing based on Christensen''s data.\n- **Part B**: Explain why the percentage of verbal openers is lower in expository texts than in narrative texts, using examples from the table.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the study challenges the myth that variety in sentence openers is essential for professional writing, based on Christensen''s findings.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the table data and the study''s purpose as described in the text.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning with Rhetorical Data**\n\nThe text mentions that professional writers do not ''make a fetish of variety for its own sake.'' Using Christensen''s data, argue whether this statement is supported by the study.\n- **Part A**: Explain what ''making a fetish of variety'' means in the context of writing.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the percentage data to show whether expository writers use a more consistent or varied sentence opener pattern.\n- **Part C**: Connect Christensen''s findings to the broader claim about professional writers and style, using specific data points from the table.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be based solely on the provided data and the text''s description of the study.'

    The numbers in the first column indicate the number of sentences, among the two hundred studied in each piece, that had sentence openers (words, phrases, or clauses which are not part of the subject cluster); the numbers

    A4I2 STYLE

    under the next four columns mark the various kinds of sentence openers.
    Rachel Carson had the highest percentage of sentence openers (39.5 per
    cent); Mark Van Doren had the lowest percentage (16 per cent). But the
    combined percentages show that almost three-quarters of the sentences writ-
    ten by these authors started out with the subject cluster rather than the sen-
    tence openers and that almost 95 per cent of the 575 sentence openers were
    of the adverbial type.

    These figures would seem to indicate that some of our esteemed modern
    writers do not, contrary to common opinion and to the advice given in some
    writing texts, strive for a notable variety in the ways they begin their sen-
    tences. And the figures also invalidate the prescription about not beginning
    a sentence with a co-ordinating conjunction. Descriptive studies of other
    aspects of prose as it is actually written would probably destroy some addi-
    tional illusions about how professional writers create their effects.

    Prose rhythm is one of the most difficult aspects of style to analyze. Perhaps
    the closest thing we have to the elaborate prosody that the Greeks and Romans
    devised for their quantitative languages is the system for scanning the Eng-
    lish sentence that George Saintsbury worked out in his A History of English
    Prose Rhythm (Edinburgh, 1912). The euphony and rhythm of sentences
    undoubtedly play a part in the communicative and persuasive process—espe-
    cially in producing emotional effects—but students would be ill advised to
    spend a great deal of time learning a system for scanning prose sentences.
    Euphony and rhythm are largely a matter for the ear, and students would
    do just as well to read their prose aloud in order to catch awkward rhythms,
    clashing vowel and consonant combinations (as in this five-word phrase),
    and distracting jingles. If, for instance, the student who wrote the following
    sentence had read it aloud, he might have caught the distracting repetition
    of the ect sound: "I will show how the testimony affected some people indi-
    rectly connected with the selection of the jurors." It is probably more impor-
    tant to apply this test when one is preparing a discourse for oral delivery, but
    most good writers apply this test also to prose that they know will be read
    silently. The sentence which is difficult to enunciate is often a grammatically
    or rhetorically defective sentence.

    But if the student is not content with relying on his ear for testing the
    rhythm of his sentences, he can resort to the fairly simple method of mark-
    ing the stresses in series of words. With a little more ingenuity, he might be
    able to group the stressed and unstressed syllables into feet. In scanning
    poetry, we can get by with knowing the five most common feet in classical
    prosody: iambic (~ —), trochaic (— ~), anapaestic (~ ~ —), dactylic

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Prose Rhythm and Communication**\n\nExplain why the sentence "I will show how the testimony affected some people indirectly connected with the selection of the jurors." is considered awkward in terms of rhythm and euphony, based on the principles discussed in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the specific issue with the repetition of the "ect" sound.\n- **Step 2**: Justify how this repetition affects the communication and persuasive process as stated in the text.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a revision to the sentence that improves its rhythm and clarity without changing its original meaning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the role of rhythm in prose and how it impacts effective communication.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Stress and Foot Analysis in Prose**\n\nUsing the method described in the text, analyze the following sentence by marking stresses and grouping syllables into feet: "The student who wrote this sentence may have caught the distracting repetition of the ect sound."\n- **Step 1**: Identify and mark the stressed syllables in the sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Group these stressed syllables into feet based on the common poetic feet mentioned (iambic, trochaic, anapaestic, dactylic).\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this grouping reveals potential rhythmic issues in the sentence structure.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must reflect an understanding of stress patterns and their relationship to the organization of feet in prose.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Rhythm and Writing Style**\n\nThe text discusses the importance of rhythm in prose and how it relates to grammatical or rhetorical defects. Consider the following statement: "A sentence that is difficult to enunciate is often a grammatically or rhetorically defective sentence."\n- **Part A**: Explain why this statement is logically sound based on the text''s discussion of rhythm and communication.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument using this statement to justify why writers should focus on rhythm when crafting prose for both oral and silent reading.\n- **Part C**: Create a counterexample to challenge the statement, using an example of a grammatically correct sentence that is still difficult to enunciate.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s ideas on rhythm, communication, and grammatical/rhetorical structure to demonstrate critical reasoning skills.'

    (— — —), and spondee (— —). To scan prose, however, we need a great
    many more combinations. In her book, The Anatomy of Prose, Marjorie
    Boulton defines twenty-three different combinations, which constitute, she
    says, "all the possible feet used in English prose." (Students who want to
    pursue these technicalities can consult pp. 55-7 of her book.) To illustrate this
    system of scansion, here is the way that Miss Boulton scanned the first nine
    verses of Psalm go in the Authorized Version of the Bible:

    Miss Boulton goes on to say about this passage: "My stresses will not, I think,
    be disputed much, though even on this point some ears might object; many
    readers will probably disagree with the division into feet at some point. How-
    ever, we can now see the contrast of stressed, monosyllabic endings and
    lighter endings, with the finality of the stress at the end on a heavy mono-
    syllable. We see how the important words are also placed where, with their
    own strong stresses, they are surrounded by weak stresses to make them
    stronger by contrast. We may also notice, if we are beginners, that the four-
    syllable and five-syllable feet are needed to describe prose accurately."

    ARTICULATION OF SENTENCES

    An investigation of the ways in which a writer articulates his sentences can
    be one of the most fruitful exercises for the student who wants to improve
    the quality of his own prose. Coherence is a troublesome problem for most
    students. They usually develop a sense for unity and emphasis long be-
    fore they master coherence. Cultivating the habit of thinking in an orderly,
    logical fashion is the best way to insure that one will express his thoughts
    coherently. But practiced writers use a number of linguistic devices to assist
    the coherent display of their thoughts. Let us see how an accomplished
    writer like Matthew Arnold makes his prose "hang together." Some of the
    verbal devices he uses to promote coherence are italicized; others will be
    pointed out in the commentary afterward.

    The critical power is of lower rank than the creative. True; but in
    assenting to this proposition, one or two things are to be kept in mind.
    It is undeniable that the exercise of a creative power, that a free creative
    activity, is the highest function of man; it is so by man's finding in it
    his true happiness. But it is undeniable, also, that men may have the
    sense of exercising this free creative activity in other ways than in pro-
    ducing great works of literature or art; if it were not so, all but a very
    few men would be shut out from the true happiness of all men. They
    may have it in well-doing, they may have it in learning, they may have it
    even in criticising. This is one thing to be kept in mind. Another is that
    the exercise of the creative power in the production of great works of
    literature or art, however high this exercise of it may rank, is not at all
    epochs and under all conditions possible; and that therefore labour may
    be vainly spent in attempting it, which might with more fruit be used
    in preparing for it, in rendering it possible. This creative power works
    with elements, with materials; what if it has not those materials, those
    elements, ready for its use? In that case, it must surely wait till they are
    ready.

    Most coherence devices (pronouns, demonstrative adjectives, repeated
    words and phrases, and some of the conjunctions) point backwards to what
    has just been said, thus connecting what has been said with what is about
    to be said. One of the commonest devices in Matthew Arnold's prose—such

Use specific examples from the passage, such as pronouns or repeated words, to demonstrate how these devices contribute to the overall structure and coherence of his argument.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text and demonstrate an understanding of how coherence devices function in rhetorical writing.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Creative Power and Its Manifestations**\n\nBased on Arnold''s discussion of the creative power, construct a logical argument that defines and explains how ''creative activity'' can manifest in different realms (e.g., literature, ethics, education) without contradicting his assertion that the highest function of man is creative activity.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate Arnold''s ideas with real-world examples or scenarios, and explicitly link them to the text''s themes of creativity and human purpose.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Creative Power in Historical Context**\n\nCompare and contrast Arnold''s view of the creative power with a historical figure or movement that emphasizes creativity in a different context (e.g., Renaissance humanism, modernist literature). Evaluate whether Arnold''s perspective is more or less comprehensive in addressing the nature and scope of creative activity.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reference specific ideas from Arnold''s text and the historical context, demonstrating an ability to analyze and synthesize different perspectives on creativity.'

    common, in fact, that it has become a distinctive mark of his style—is the
    frequent repetition of key words and phrases. Arnold was a great phrase-
    maker, and once he had coined a phrase that carried the theme of an essay,
    he repeated that phrase time and time again in the essay. So conspicuous was
    this mannerism in his prose that one is inclined to believe that the cardinal
    principle of his expository technique was the famous pedagogical maxim,
    "Repetition is the mother of studies." The most obtrusive repetition in this
    selection is the word creative—the key word of this paragraph and one of
    the two key words in the entire essay. The repetition then of substantive
    words is one of the linguistic means of stitching our sentences together.

    Arnold also frequently uses demonstrative pronouns and demonstrative
    adjectives (this, that; these, those) and personal pronouns. The original
    meaning of the word demonstrate is "to show, to point." Demonstrative pro-
    nouns and adjectives usually point backwards, tying what follows to what
    has gone before. By their very nature, all pronouns (except indefinite pro-
    nouns, like anyone and someone) point to a referent. Because of the close
    relationship between the pronoun and its referent, it is extremely important
    to be sure the referent is clear. When it is vague or, worse yet, when the
    referent is not there at all, the coherence of our writing is bound to suffer.

    Good writers also make liberal use of conjunctions and conjunctive adverbs
    for stitching sentences together. The chief grammatical function of co-
    ordinating conjunctions is to splice together words, phrases, and clauses. But
    when co-ordinating conjunctions are placed at the beginning of the sentence
    (and Professor Christensen's chart reveals how often modern writers do
    this), these conjunctions assume the rhetorical function of providing a logi-
    cal bridge between sentences. Conjunctive adverbs—words like however,
    nevertheless, moreover, also, indeed, therefore—are even more common de-
    vices for aiding coherence. One can point up the logical relationship between
    sentences simply by inserting the appropriate conjunctive word.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Repetition and Key Words in Arnold''s Prose**\n\nIn the text, Arnold emphasizes the use of repetition as a stylistic device. Identify and analyze two instances where repetition is used to convey meaning, focusing on the term ''creative'' as a key phrase.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the repetition of ''creative'' in the paragraph reinforces the central theme.\n- **Part B**: Compare this to another instance of repetition in the text, such as the use of demonstrative pronouns or conjunctions.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how this stylistic choice affects the reader''s understanding of Arnold''s expository technique.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion on repetition as a pedagogical technique and demonstrate an understanding of its role in coherence and emphasis.'

    We will note only two additional devices that Arnold uses to connect his sentences. Fragmentary sentences can sometimes strengthen coherence. We have an instance of this in the second sentence of Arnold's paragraph. The single word True constitutes an elliptical sentence. Filled out, the ellipsis would read something like this: "That proposition is true." The single word here conveys a meaning only because of its juxtaposition to the previous sentence; since it has to look backward to the previous sentence in order to become meaningful, it is "tied" to that sentence. This same principle of "dependent meaning" prevails in conversation, where we often talk in fragmentary sentences ("Where are you going tonight?" "The movies." "With whom?" "Charlotte.").

    Another device that Arnold uses in this paragraph is parallelism, which is reinforced by the figure of anaphora (repetition of identical words at the beginning of successive phrases). Three independent clauses are set down, one after the other ("They may have it in well-doing, they may have it in learning, they may have it even in criticising"). Although there are no conjunctions (asyndeton) to tie the clauses together grammatically, the clauses are connected by parallel structure and identical words. In addition to the functions that we noted in the analysis of Clark Kerr's two sentences, parallelism can also be used for coherence.

    The passage quoted from Matthew Arnold exemplifies most of the verbal devices that good writers use to articulate their sentences. Good writers use such devices so unobtrusively that the sutures hardly show. A study of how an author uses them will help to account for the clarity of one man's prose and the fuzziness of another's.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Coherence Strategies in Prose**\n\nArnold''s paragraph employs two devices for coherence: elliptical sentences and parallelism. Using the information provided,\n- **Part A**: Explain how the single word ''True'' functions as an elliptical sentence. Justify your answer by referencing its context and the concept of ''dependent meaning''.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how parallelism contributes to coherence in Arnold''s paragraph. Use the example of the three independent clauses and explain how repetition of identical words at the beginning of phrases reinforces this.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the coherence strategies used in Arnold''s paragraph with those in Clark Kerr''s sentences. Highlight how parallelism and elliptical sentences serve different functions in achieving clarity.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of elliptical sentences, parallelism, and anaphora as described in the text. Use specific examples from Arnold''s paragraph to support your analysis.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Devices in Writing**\n\nUsing the principles discussed in the text, create a paragraph that demonstrates both elliptical sentences and parallelism.\n- **Part A**: Write a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) that uses an elliptical sentence, such as the single word ''True'', in a logical context.\n- **Part B**: Incorporate parallelism into your paragraph by using anaphora (repetition of identical words at the beginning of phrases).\n- **Part C**: Analyze your own paragraph, explaining how the devices contribute to coherence and clarity. Reference the text''s explanation of ''asyndeton'' (absence of conjunctions) and how it relates to the use of parallel structure.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph must be self-contained and demonstrate mastery of both devices. Your analysis must explicitly connect the techniques to the text''s discussion of rhetorical strategies.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Rhetorical Functions**\n\nThe text discusses how good writers use verbal devices so unobtrusively that the sutures hardly show. Using this idea,\n- **Part A**: Explain why Arnold''s use of parallelism in his paragraph is more effective than Clark Kerr''s sentences. Reference the text''s explanation of how parallelism can be used for coherence and clarity.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the implications of ''dependent meaning'' in elliptical sentences for written communication. Provide an example from Arnold''s paragraph that illustrates this concept.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the claim that ''all good writing is unobtrusive''. Use the text''s discussion of rhetorical devices to argue whether this statement is true or false, and why.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a deep understanding of the functions and effects of rhetorical devices as outlined in the text. Use specific examples from Arnold''s paragraph to support your analysis.'

    Since we are going to devote a long section of this chapter to a discussion
    of figures of speech, this is not the place to discuss them in detail. Suffice it
    to say here that they constitute one of the most revealing features of a man's
    prose style. If they are apt and fresh, they can contribute greatly to the
    clarity, liveliness, and interest of a man's style. But they must not be culti-
    vated for their own sake. The excessive, strained use of figures proved to
    be detrimental to the "gracefulness" for which the Euphuistic writers of the
    sixteenth century were striving in their prose. On the other hand, the absence
    or scarcity of figurative language can have a deadening effect on style. Al-
    though it is not true that Jonathan Swift excluded all figurative language
    from his prose, it is true that he used figurative language sparingly. That
    rarity of metaphorical language may have been what Dr. Johnson had in
    mind when he made his famous comment on Swift's style: "For purposes
    merely didactic, when something is to be told that was not known before,
    [his style] is in the highest degree proper, but against that inattention by
    which known truths are suffered to lie neglected, it makes no provision; it
    instructs, but does not persuade."

    PARAGRAPHING

    There is a style of paragraphing as well as a style of sentence structure.
    Paragraphing, like punctuation, is a feature only of the written language.
    As a matter of fact, we can regard paragraphing as a typographical device
    for punctuating units of thought larger than the thought conveyed by a
    single sentence. The student is so accustomed to seeing, in the print he reads,
    indentations of segments of thought that he comes to take paragraphing

    And because the indentations are always there on the printed page, the
    student does not realize how much the marking off of thought-units facili-
    tates his reading. Perhaps the best way to show the student how typo-
    graphical devices contribute to the readability of printed prose is to reproduce
    a passage of prose with no punctuation, capitalization, or paragraphing:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Figurative Language in Prose**\n\nUsing the text''s discussion on figures of speech, explain why Jonathan Swift''s sparing use of figurative language might be considered both effective and limiting in his prose style.\n- **Step 1**: Reference the text''s assertion that figures of speech can enhance clarity and interest when ''apt and fresh''.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast this with Dr. Johnson''s criticism of Swift''s lack of persuasion in ''inattention by which known truths are suffered to lie neglected''.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a logical argument about how Swift''s approach balances instructional clarity with the potential loss of persuasive power.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly tie Swift''s use of figurative language to the text''s definitions of effectiveness and limitation in prose style.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Paragraphing and Punctuation**\n\nExplain how the absence of paragraphing, capitalization, and punctuation in a prose passage affects readability.\n- **Step 1**: Use the text''s definition of paragraphing as a ''typographical device for punctuating units of thought''.\n- **Step 2**: Compare this to the role of punctuation in signaling pauses and emphasis.\n- **Step 3**: Construct a logical argument about how the combination of these elements (paragraphing, punctuation, capitalization) contributes to the overall coherence of written prose.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the text''s explanation of paragraphing with its implications for readability and coherence.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Style in Literary Figures**\n\nCompare and contrast the style of prose between Jonathan Swift and the ''Euphuistic writers of the sixteenth century'' based on the text''s discussion of figurative language.\n- **Step 1**: Reference the text''s assertion that excessive, strained use of figures of speech was detrimental to ''gracefulness'' in Euphuistic prose.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast this with Swift''s ''rarity of metaphorical language'' as a deliberate stylistic choice.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with an analysis of how their approaches reflect broader literary principles about the balance between ornamentation and clarity.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text''s descriptions of both writers'' styles and their implications for effective prose writing.'

    It seems to me that it was far from right for the professor of English in Yale, the professor of English literature in Columbia, and Wilkie Collins to deliver opinions on Cooper's literature without having read some of it. It would have been much more decorous to keep silent and let persons talk who have read Cooper. Cooper's art has some defects in one place, in Deerslayer, and in the restricted space of two thirds of a page, Cooper has scored 114 offenses against literary art out of a possible 115. It breaks the record. There are nineteen rules governing literary art in the domain of romantic fiction; some say twenty-two. In Deerslayer, Cooper violated eighteen of them. These eighteen require that a tale shall accomplish something and arrive somewhere, but the Deerslayer tale accomplishes nothing and arrives in the air. They require that the episodes of a tale shall be necessary parts of the tale and shall help to develop it, but as the Deerslayer tale is not a tale and accomplishes nothing and arrives nowhere, the episodes have no rightful place in the work. Since there was nothing for them to develop, they require that the personages in a tale shall be alive except in the case of corpses, and that always the reader shall be able to tell the corpses from the others. But this detail has often been overlooked in the Deerslayer tale.

    If the student has difficulty making sense out of this river of words, he should be grateful to those printers and grammarians who invented typographical devices to mark off meaningful segments of thought. After trying out various combinations, the student might eventually be able to make sense of this passage, especially in those sections where there are enough grammatical signals to tell him what words are related. He will probably make faster progress in deciphering the passage if he reads it aloud, because the voice will add another grammatical element, intonation, which is the vocal equivalent of the graphic marks of punctuation. But there will be spots in this passage which will remain ambiguous, because grammar will allow in those places two or more combinations of words, each of which would make sense.

    Now let us reproduce the passage as Mark Twain wrote it, restoring his punctuation, capitalization, and paragraphing:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Literary Art Critique**\n\nAnalyze the critique provided in the passage regarding Cooper''s literary art, particularly focusing on the 114 offenses against literary art in *Deerslayer*.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the specific literary rules that Cooper violated in *Deerslayer*.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how these violations impact the narrative structure and reader engagement.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this critique to the modern understanding of narrative coherence, drawing from classical rhetoric principles mentioned in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate both the specific criticisms and broader literary principles, demonstrating a deep understanding of the text''s argument.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Grammatical Structure in Ambiguous Texts**\n\nExplain how the passage''s ambiguity is a result of grammatical flexibility, using specific examples from the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two instances where grammar allows for multiple interpretations.\n- **Step 2**: Discuss how the lack of punctuation and capitalization contributes to this ambiguity.\n- **Step 3**: Propose a method to resolve these ambiguities, referencing the role of intonation and punctuation in clarifying meaning.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both grammatical structure and the role of punctuation in clarifying ambiguous text.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Literary Critique**\n\nThe passage critiques Cooper''s *Deerslayer* for failing to meet the criteria of a coherent narrative.\n- **Part A**: Determine why the author argues that *Deerslayer* is not a tale, despite containing episodes.\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument that could be made to defend Cooper''s work, referencing the historical context or reader interpretation.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate whether the critique is a sound literary analysis, considering the role of subjective interpretation in literary criticism.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate logical reasoning, historical context, and the subjective nature of literary analysis as discussed in the text.'

    The typographical device which contributes most, of course, to clarifying
    the syntax of a succession of words is the device for marking off sentences—
    an initial capital letter and end-punctuation (period, question mark, excla-
    mation point). We underestimate, perhaps, how much of a contribution to
    clarity is made by other typographical devices—such simple things as commas,
    capital letters, italics, hyphens, quotation marks. Nor should we overlook
    the contribution that indentation of paragraphs makes to ease of reading. The
    value of paragraphing is evident in the Mark Twain passage. Indentation
    marks the shifts in the development of thought and indicates the relation-
    ship of the parts. Simply by setting off the violated rules in separate para-
    graphs and further marking them with numbers, Mark Twain makes it
    clear that he is specifying a series of parts.

    A study of the density of an author's paragraphs tells us a great deal
    about the "weight" of his style. Many considerations, of course, dictate
    whether paragraphs will be long or short—the subject matter, the occasion,
    the audience. Narrative, for instance, especially when it is dealing with rapid
    action, often moves along in a series of short paragraphs. In dialogue, too,
    each shift of speaker is indicated by a new paragraph. For purposes of
    transition or emphasis, an author will insert a one- or two-sentence para-
    graph. And when one is writing copy for the narrow columns of a newspaper,
    he will rather arbitrarily chop up his prose into very short paragraphs.

    A STUDENT REPORT ON A STUDY OF STYLE 419

    But when all allowances have been made for such conventions and for
    various rhetorical situations, it remains true that professional writers gen-
    erally write longer paragraphs than unpracticed writers do. Many of the
    one- and two-sentence paragraphs that students write have no rhetorical
    justification whatever. Such short paragraphs simply reveal that the students
    have not developed their thoughts adequately. They have nothing more to
    say, or think they have nothing more to say, on the idea presented in that
    paragraph. Perhaps by resorting to the topics to find something to say, the
    student will be able to put some meat on the bare bones of his paragraph.

    We have devoted several pages to a discussion of the objectively observable features of style because it is by this kind of close analysis that one learns why the style of an author produces its effects and learns also how to go about improving his own style. To illustrate the profit to be derived from such a close study, we will present the results of a student project.*

    Two sections of an Honors Freshman class were set the task of making a comparative analysis of the length of sentences and paragraphs in a specified number of paragraphs in F. L. Lucas's essay "What Is Style?" and in all the paragraphs of one of their expository themes. For the purposes of this study, a sentence was defined as "a group of words beginning with a capital letter and ending with some mark of end-punctuation." The students were told that in choosing eight paragraphs from the Lucas essay they should avoid short transitional paragraphs and any paragraphs containing two or more sentences of quoted material. The students were presented with a mimeographed sheet containing the following items to be filled in:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Style Analysis in Rhetoric**\n\nUsing the framework of sentence and paragraph analysis from the text, design an experiment to compare the stylistic effectiveness of two different essays. Your experiment must include:\n- A definition of ''stylistic effectiveness'' based on the analysis of sentence and paragraph length.\n- A method for selecting paragraphs to analyze, including criteria for excluding short transitional paragraphs and quoted material.\n- A table similar to the one provided in the text for recording data, with at least six metrics (e.g., average sentence length, longest paragraph in sentences).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your experiment must be logically consistent and use the text''s definitions of sentences and paragraphs. You must explain how the metrics you choose relate to stylistic effectiveness as discussed in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Reasoning with Rhetorical Structures**\n\nThe text discusses the importance of analyzing observable features of style. Using the data collection framework presented in the text, create a hypothesis about how sentence length affects readability in expository writing. Your hypothesis must:\n- Reference the text''s definition of a sentence (a group of words beginning with a capital letter and ending with punctuation).\n- Include at least two variables: one independent (e.g., sentence length) and one dependent (e.g., readability).\n- Propose a method for testing the hypothesis using the provided evaluation table, including how you would calculate readability from sentence length.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your hypothesis must be grounded in the text''s discussion of style and readability, and your method must use the data collection tools described. You must explain how the variables are related based on the text''s analysis of rhetorical structures.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Rhetorical Analysis Framework**\n\nUsing the evaluation table from the text, design a comparison between two expository essays on the same topic. Your analysis must:\n- Include at least four metrics from the table (e.g., average sentence length, paragraph structure).\n- Explain how each metric contributes to the overall style and effectiveness of the essay as discussed in the text.\n- Provide a conclusion that evaluates which essay is more effective based on the analysis, using reasoning from the text''s discussion of rhetorical style.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your evaluation must use the text''s definitions and criteria for analyzing style. You must link each metric to its role in rhetorical effectiveness as described in the text, and your conclusion must be based on logical reasoning from the provided framework.'

    The numbers that the students entered in the first column differed according to the paragraphs they chose to study, but we can give some mean figures for four of the items in the list:

    1. The average length of Lucas's sentences was 20.8 words.

    2. About 17 per cent of Lucas's sentences were ten words or more over the average.

    3. About 40 per cent of Lucas's sentences were five words or more below the average.

    4. Lucas averaged 7.6 sentences per paragraph—a fairly well-developed paragraph.

    Most of the students found that their average sentence matched the length of Lucas's average sentence. Many of the students were surprised to learn, however, that they had a higher percentage of above-average sentences and a strikingly lower percentage of below-average sentences. Perhaps the most dramatic difference that the students noted was in paragraph development. At least half of the students found that they were averaging between three and four sentences in their paragraphs.

    In addition to filling out the mimeographed sheet, the students submitted an essay in which they commented on what they had learned about style from this exercise. Excerpts from their essays are reproduced below.

    First of all, here are some of the students' comments about sentence length and sentence variety:

    I found that the percentage of sentences in Lucas's essay that contained more than ten words over the average sentence was 17%, while mine was a mere 3%. But the percentage of his sentences that contained five words or more below the average was 40% compared to my 16%. I see now that I must strive for greater variety of sentence structure and length in my themes in order for the pieces to be more effective.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Length Analysis**\n\nLucas''s essay has an average sentence length of 20.8 words, with 17% of his sentences being ten words or more over average and 40% being five words or more below average.\n\nYour task is to analyze the implications of these statistics for effective writing:\n- **Part A**: Compare Lucas''s sentence length distribution to your own. If you found that 3% of your sentences were ten words or more over average and 16% were five words or more below average, explain how this difference might affect the readability and impact of your writing.\n- **Part B**: Considering that Lucas averaged 7.6 sentences per paragraph, while most students averaged between three and four sentences per paragraph, evaluate how this difference might influence the overall structure and coherence of the essay.\n- **Part C**: Propose a writing strategy that combines sentence variety and paragraph development to improve your essay''s effectiveness, based on the data provided.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate quantitative analysis with rhetorical effectiveness and demonstrate a clear understanding of how sentence length and paragraph structure contribute to writing quality.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Reflection on Writing Style**\n\nAfter analyzing Lucas''s essay, you wrote an essay commenting on what you learned about style. Use the data provided to construct a coherent argument about the importance of sentence variety and paragraph development in effective writing:\n- **Part A**: Reference the statistics about percentage of above-average and below-average sentences to explain how sentence variety impacts reader engagement.\n- **Part B**: Discuss the difference in paragraph development between Lucas and the average student, and how this affects the overall flow of an essay.\n- **Part C**: Synthesize your findings into a conclusion that emphasizes the balance between sentence structure and paragraph organization for effective communication.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate critical thinking by connecting the data to rhetorical principles and showing how stylistic choices influence reader comprehension.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Rhetorical Analysis**\n\nUsing the data from the text, create an original rhetorical analysis that addresses how sentence length and paragraph development contribute to the effectiveness of written communication:\n- **Part A**: Design a hypothetical scenario where sentence variety and paragraph development could be used to enhance the persuasive power of an argument.\n- **Part B**: Apply the statistics about sentence lengths to a real-world example (e.g., a public speech, advertisement, or academic paper) and evaluate how the chosen format could be improved using the data.\n- **Part C**: Propose a new writing guideline that integrates both sentence structure and paragraph organization, based on your analysis.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must show creative problem-solving by applying the data to real-world contexts and demonstrating an understanding of how rhetorical strategies can be optimized for different purposes.'

- prompt: "My average sentence length is very close to that of Mr. Lucas. I think  \nthis is misleading, however, since in my high school newspaper work I  \nacquired the habit of gathering more than one thought in a single sen-  \ntence. My sentence length is good, but my sentence content could be im-  \nproved. Another factor that was evident is that I tend to use fewer short  \nsentences than professional writers do. I think I can explain this lack of  \nshort sentences by considering the subject matter of the themes I write.  \nI have noticed that in the past I would use longer, more involved (and  \nless clear) sentences to write about things I didn't feel completely at ease  \nin writing about. I use short sentences to present ideas that are very lucid  \nto me.\n\nOne thing I found is that good prose doesn't necessarily imply long,  \nverbose sentences and polysyllabic words.\n\nThere is not quite enough variety in length or pattern in my sentences.  \nEven my longer sentences tend to be of the compound variety rather than  \nthe complex or compound-complex type.\n\nNow for some excerpts from students' comments on paragraphing:\n\nThis paragraph analysis revealed some drastic differences in style. My  \nparagraphs, surprisingly, are considerably longer than Lucas's. The aver-  \nage number of sentences per paragraph in my work is twelve, whereas  \nMr. Lucas's average is about eight. My longest paragraph has sixteen  \nsentences, twice the professional's average. This could indicate poor para-  \ngraph planning and division on my part. My extended paragraphs seem  \nmuch like run-on sentences and probably have a tiring effect on my  \nreader.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Sentence Structure and Paragraph Length**\n\nCompare your writing style with that of Mr. Lucas based on the provided text about sentence length and paragraph structure:\n- **Part A**: Discuss how your tendency to use longer, more involved sentences affects the clarity and flow of your writing. Use specific examples from the text to support your reasoning.\n- **Part B**: Evaluate the potential impact of having paragraphs with an average of twelve sentences on reader engagement and comprehension. Justify your evaluation using the text''s mention of ''run-on sentences'' and ''tiring effect on the reader.''\n- **Part C**: Propose a strategy to balance sentence length and paragraph structure based on the text''s advice about ''good prose not necessarily implying long, verbose sentences.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s analysis of sentence structure and paragraphing, demonstrating an understanding of how these elements affect readability and style.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Interpreting Paragraphing Techniques**\n\nExamine the differences in paragraph structure between your writing and Mr. Lucas''s based on the provided text:\n- **Part A**: Explain why your paragraphs, which average twelve sentences, might be considered ''poorly planned'' according to the text. Use the text''s reference to ''run-on sentences'' in your explanation.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the potential consequences of having ''extended paragraphs'' that are similar to ''run-on sentences.'' How does this relate to the text''s mention of a ''tiring effect on the reader''?\n- **Part C**: Suggest how you could revise your paragraphing to align with the text''s advice that ''good prose doesn''t necessarily imply long, verbose sentences.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reflect an understanding of the text''s critique of paragraph length and structure, with clear reasoning based on the provided analysis.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesizing Writing Style and Rhetorical Principles**\n\nIntegrate the concepts of sentence structure, paragraphing, and prose style from the text to evaluate your writing habits:\n- **Part A**: Discuss how your use of longer sentences might reflect a ''lack of short sentences'' as noted in the text. How does this relate to your comfort level with certain topics?\n- **Part B**: Explain the text''s assertion that ''good prose doesn''t necessarily imply long, verbose sentences.'' Provide an example from your writing that demonstrates this principle.\n- **Part C**: Propose a method to improve paragraph planning based on the text''s advice about avoiding ''run-on sentences'' and ensuring a balance in sentence length.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an ability to synthesize the text''s rhetorical principles with your own writing practices, showing a clear understanding of how structure affects readability and style.'

    My longest paragraph is 17 sentences, almost 10 sentences over my aver-
    age paragraph length; Lucas's longest paragraph has 10 sentences, less
    than 3 sentences over his average paragraph length. Also, in this long
    paragraph the average length of sentences is 14 words, which is 7 words
    per sentence below the average for the whole theme. And in this same
    paragraph of mine there are 12 out of the total 17 sentences which con-
    tain 5 words or more below the average sentence. The reason for this
    paragraph being strikingly different from my average paragraph is that
    I used a different style of writing in this paragraph. I tried to make an
    emotional appeal to back up my arguments, using short questions and
    terse statements. In trying to give the effect of an impassioned speech,
    I departed from my usual prose style; thus this paragraph is not repre-
    sentative of my usual style of paragraphing.
    422

    STYLE

    In Lucas's piece there is an average of 126 words per paragraph, while
    I have an average of only 70 words per paragraph. I probably should use
    more words to develop my ideas, not for the sake of wordiness but for
    the sake of being more fully understood. I leave out examples and ex-
    planations which may be vital to the clarity of the theme.

    In the paragraphs I chose to study, Mr. Lucas used a total of fifty-six
    sentences. I used a total of fifty-four sentences in my theme. This aver-
    ages to approximately seven sentences per paragraph in both essays. How-
    ever, this similarity is slightly invalid. In choosing the Lucas paragraphs,
    I was careful to choose only those which were of an "average" length; I
    purposely skipped those paragraphs which seemed short. One of the
    paragraphs in my theme contained only three sentences, but I had to
    count it. This tended to lower my average number of sentences per para-
    graph, whereas Mr. Lucas's average was slightly inflated because only
    "average" paragraphs were studied.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analyzing Paragraph Structure and Word Count**\n\nGiven the provided passage, calculate and compare the average number of words per paragraph for both Lucas''s essay and your own theme.\n- **Step 1**: Determine the total number of words in each author''s selected paragraphs.\n- **Step 2**: Divide by the number of paragraphs to find the average words per paragraph for each.\n- **Step 3**: Compare the results and explain why there is a difference in average word count between the two authors'' selected paragraphs.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must include specific numerical calculations and a logical explanation based on the text provided.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Evaluating Sentence Structure and Clarity**\n\nAnalyze the sentence structure and clarity of both authors'' selected paragraphs.\n- **Part A**: Calculate the average number of sentences per paragraph for both authors.\n- **Part B**: Explain why one author''s approach to sentence structure may be more effective for conveying complex ideas, based on the text provided.\n- **Part C**: Propose a strategy for improving clarity in writing, incorporating elements from both authors'' styles.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate specific details from the text and demonstrate an understanding of effective writing techniques.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Interpreting Writing Style and Purpose**\n\nAnalyze the writing styles of both authors based on the provided text.\n- **Part A**: Identify one stylistic choice that reflects the purpose of each author''s writing.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the difference in paragraph length and sentence structure affects the overall purpose of each essay.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate which author''s style is more suitable for a specific academic or professional context, and justify your choice using the text provided.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate specific details from the text and demonstrate an understanding of rhetorical strategies in writing.'

    Another thing that I realized when doing this stylistic study is that in the professional writers' work the paragraphs fit together like the pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Each paragraph develops a separate thought but becomes an integral part of the whole. I have trouble tying my ideas together. Although all my ideas relate to the theme topic, often I find that they do not follow in a logical pattern.

    In addition to commenting on sentences and paragraphs, several students commented on other features of style that they had noted in doing this study. Here are some excerpts from those comments:

    I see now that enlarging my vocabulary is necessary to improve my style. I don't mean necessarily that I must start using bigger words; I mean rather that I must learn when certain words should be used. I must learn to use big words only when they fall naturally into place and when they can be fully understood by the intended audience. Professional writers do not always use big words, but their knowledge of words enables them to use the proper word at the proper time.

    One characteristic of Lucas's style which I don't like and which I think I avoided in my writing is the excessive use of parentheses and dashes. I certainly feel that a parenthesis or a dash is appropriate at times, and, in fact, I used a dash four times in my writing. But I believe that Mr. Lucas overworked parentheses and dashes. I feel that the reader's train of thought is broken when the writing contains many dashes or parentheses.

    A STUDENT REPORT ON A STUDY OF STYLE 423

    Lucas brings his writing to life by the use of figures of speech. When he says, "Men are often taken, like rabbits, by the ears," his writing becomes vivid and distinctive. Another of Mr. Lucas's figures of speech, "There are blustering signatures that swish across the page like cornstalks bowed before a tempest," shows that he avoids the trite, overworked figures. He searches for new and fresh expressions. I noticed that in my piece of writing there wasn't a single simile, metaphor, or personification.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Paragraph Structure and Style**\n\nAnalyze the paragraph from Lucas''s writing: "Men are often taken, like rabbits, by the ears..." and compare it to your own writing style.\n- **Task A**: Identify the literary device used in Lucas''s metaphor and explain how it enhances the writer''s intent.\n- **Task B**: Evaluate how your own writing, as described in the student report, avoids figures of speech such as similes and metaphors.\n- **Task C**: Propose a strategy for incorporating the use of figures of speech into your writing without overusing parentheses or dashes, as noted in the student''s critique.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of literary devices and paragraph coherence, integrating insights from the student''s analysis of Lucas''s style.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Vocabulary and Contextual Appropriateness**\n\nConsider the student''s comment about vocabulary: "I must learn to use big words only when they fall naturally into place and when they can be fully understood by the intended audience."\n- **Task A**: Provide an example of a context where a ''big word'' would be appropriate and another where it would not.\n- **Task B**: Explain how the use of a single, precise word can be more effective than multiple smaller words in certain contexts.\n- **Task C**: Reflect on how the student''s approach to vocabulary aligns with the principles of effective writing as discussed in the text.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of vocabulary use and contextual appropriateness, integrating the student''s insights into a coherent argument.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Balance of Punctuation and Literary Devices**\n\nThe student notes that Lucas uses figures of speech to bring his writing to life, while the student avoids them.\n- **Task A**: Analyze the difference between using a simile (e.g., "like rabbits") and using parentheses or dashes in writing.\n- **Task B**: Create a paragraph that incorporates one figure of speech and one appropriate use of parentheses or dashes without overusing them.\n- **Task C**: Justify why a balance between literary devices and punctuation is essential for effective writing, referencing the student''s critique of Lucas''s excessive use of parentheses.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of punctuation, literary devices, and their interplay in creating a cohesive writing style.'

    Although Lucas's longest sentence is twice as long as my longest sen-
    tence, my sentence is harder to follow. This difference in readability can
    be attributed partly to the number of syllables. Although syllable-count
    was not included on the study sheet, it has a great bearing on the clarity
    of one's prose. The majority of words in Lucas's sentences are mono-
    syllabic. Because of the monosyllabic diction, the interest of the reader
    is not bogged down by heavy words.

    This study also confirmed something I was already suspicious of—I don't
    write really long sentences. This, I believe, is due to the fact that I am
    afraid of the punctuation a long sentence may require. It is much simpler
    to write two short sentences correctly than to write one long sentence
    correctly. Since we were graded in high school more on correctness than
    on style, I formed the habit of writing two shorter sentences rather than
    one long one. I guess I'll have to start worrying about style as well as
    correctness if I want to become a good writer.

    I noticed how well the parts of Mr. Lucas's essay were proportioned and
    how mine seemed rather top-heavy. A closer look showed me that I over-
    develop the beginnings of my essays, often leaving the middle thinly
    developed.

    I have noticed that sometimes my sentences sound artificial and stiff
    because I place adverb clauses and verbal phrases where they do not fit
    naturally....Good professional writers have mastered the art of appro-
    priateness. I have found that most professional writers' long sentences
    are surprisingly easy to follow, while my long sentences are frequently
    too involved to be understood.

    Here are a few excerpts from the students' comments on the general value
    of a close study like this. What is particularly notable is that the students
    retained their sense of perspective. They saw no merit in cultivating any

    it contributed to the effectiveness of the passage in which it occurred:

    icial to me, but I would like to consider the choice and arrangement of

    the length of his sentences and paragraphs.

    I believe, however, that this comparison between my prose and Lucas's
    reveals simply a difference in style and that no definite decisions can be
    made about what I should do with my prose style. In order to make such
    a decision, I would have to compare my vocabulary and sentence struc-
    ture with Mr. Lucas's when both of us were writing on the same sub-
    ject-matter.

    In general, style depends on a person's individuality and his basic knowl-
    edge of English grammar. It doesn't depend on how long the sentences
    are or how short they are. Mr. Lucas has successfully combined English
    grammar with his own personal touch to produce a good piece of prose.
    My own style suffers from the fact that my knowledge of English gram-
    mar has not yet developed enough to aid my individuality of expression.

    Although this study cannot definitely determine whether my style is good
    or bad (since there is no entirely good or bad style), it can show the
    major similarities and differences between my style and a typical modern
    style.

    The style of a professional—in this case, F. L. Lucas—shouldn't be slav-
    ishly copied, for it is only by evolving his own style that a student gains
    enough command over the language to become an effective writer.

    So much for this discussion of what to look for when one analyzes prose
    style. The student will be further aided in developing his own style and in
    developing a technique for analyzing style by practicing some of the imita-
    tion exercises recommended in a later section of this chapter. The student
    is also urged to read the stylistic analyses of Addison's Spectator essay and
    of President Kennedy's Inaugural Address at the end of this chapter.

    We come now to a consideration of figures of speech. It is fair enough to regard figures of speech as the "graces of language," as the "dressing of thought," as "embellishments," for indeed they do "decorate" our prose and give it "style," in the couturier's sense. But it would be a mistake to regard embellishment as the chief or sole function of figures. The classical rhetoricians certainly did not look upon them as decorative devices primarily. Metaphor, according to Aristotle, did give "charm and distinction" to our expression; but even more than that, metaphor was another way to give "clearness" and "liveliness" to the expression of our thoughts. Figures, in his view, provided one of the best ways to strike that happy balance between "the obvious and the obscure," so that our audience could grasp our ideas promptly and thereby be disposed to accept our arguments.

    "What, then, can oratorical imagery effect?" Longinus asked. He was even more explicit than Aristotle in pointing out the rhetorical function of figures: "Well, it is able in many ways to infuse vehemence and passion into spoken words, while more particularly when it is combined with the argumentative passages it not only persuades the hearer but actually makes him its slave." —On the Sublime, XV, 9.

    It was Quintilian who most explicitly related the figures to the logos, pathos, and éthos of argument. Quintilian looked upon the figures as another means of lending "credibility to our arguments," of "exciting the emotions," and of winning "approval for our characters as pleaders" (Instit. Orat., IX, i). This view of the function of figures of speech is perhaps the most reliable attitude to adopt toward these devices of style. Because figures can render our thoughts vividly concrete, they help us to communicate with our audience clearly and effectively; because they stir emotional responses, they can carry truth, in Wordsworth's phrase, "alive into the heart by passion"; and because they elicit admiration for the eloquence of the speaker or writer, they can exert a powerful ethical appeal.

    Sister Miriam Joseph in her book Shakespeare's Use of the Arts of Language reclassified the more than two hundred figures distinguished by the Tudor rhetoricians according to the four categories: grammar, logos, pathos, and ethos. In doing this, she was able to demonstrate, quite convincingly, that the three "schools" of rhetoric during the Renaissance (the Ramists, the traditionalists, and the figurists) saw the figures as being intimately connected with the topics of invention. Metaphor, for instance, involving comparison of like things, is tied up with the topic of similarity; antithesis, involving the juxtaposition of opposites, is tied up with the topic of dissimilarity or of contraries. Then there were figures, like apostrophe, that were calculated to work directly on the emotions, and figures, like comprobatio, that were calculated to establish the ethical image of the speaker or writer. In our exposition we shall frequently point out the relationship of the figures either with grammar or with the three modes of persuasive appeal.

    The mention of two hundred figures of speech in the previous paragraph may have appalled the student. If pressed, most students could name—even if they could not define or illustrate—a half dozen figures of speech. But where did those other figures come from? and what are they? In their passion for anatomizing and categorizing knowledge, the Humanists of the Renaissance delighted in classifying and sub-classifying the figures. Admittedly, they were being overly subtle in distinguishing such a multitude of figures. The most widely used classical handbook in the Renaissance schools, Rhetorica ad Herennium, required the students to learn only 65 figures. Susenbrotus, in his popular Epitome troporum ac schematum (1540), distinguished 132 figures. But Henry Peacham, in his 1577 edition of The Garden of Eloquence, pushed the number up to 184. Pity the poor Tudor school-boy who was expected to define and illustrate and to use in his own compositions a goodly number of these figures.

    We are not going to plague the student with a long catalogue of figures,
    but we are going to introduce more figures than he has met with in his
    previous study of style. If nothing else, the student should become aware,
    through this exposure, that his language has more figurative resources than
    he was conscious of. And he may discover that he has been using many of
    the figures of speech all his life. For men did not begin to use figures of
    speech only after academicians had classified and defined them; rather, the
    figures were classified and defined after men had been using them for
    centuries. Like the principles of grammar, poetics, and rhetoric, the doctrine
    of the figures was arrived at inductively. Rhetoricians merely gave "names"
    to the verbal practices of their fellow men.

    What do we mean by the term "figures of speech"? We mean the same
    thing that Quintilian meant when he used the term figura: "any deviation,
    either in thought or expression, from the ordinary and simple method of
    speaking, a change analogous to the different positions our bodies assume
    when we sit down, lie down, or look back.... Let the definition of a figure,
    therefore, be a form of speech artfully varied from common usage (Ergo
    figura sit arte aliqua novata forma dicendi)"—Instit. Orat., IX, i, 11.

    We will use "figures of speech" as the generic term for any artful devia-
    tions from the ordinary mode of speaking or writing. But we will divide
    the figures of speech into two main groups—the schemes and the tropes. A

    Both types of figures involve a transference of some kind: a trope, a trans-
    ference of meaning; a scheme, a transference of order. When Shakespeare's
    Mark Antony said, "Brutus is an honorable man," he was using the trope
    called irony, because he was "transferring" the ordinary meaning of the word
    honorable to convey a different meaning to his audience. If Mark Antony
    had said, "Honorable is the man who gives his life for his country," he
    would have been using a species of the scheme hyperbaton, because he would
    be "transferring" the usual order of words. In a sense, of course, both schemes
    and tropes involve a change of "meaning," since both result in effects that
    are different from the ordinary mode of expression. But for all practical
    purposes, our distinction is clear enough to enable the student to distinguish
    between a scheme and a trope.

    The terms used to label the various figures appear formidable—strange,
    polysyllabic words, most of them merely transliterated from the Greek. But
    technical terms, in any discipline, are always difficult at first sight; they are
    difficult, however, mainly because they are unfamiliar. Whenever we study a
    new discipline we have to learn the "names" of things peculiar to that disci-
    pline. Inevitably these specialized terms will be puzzling, but they will remain
    puzzling only until we learn to connect the sign with the concept or thing
    for which it stands. The word tree is difficult for the child only until he
    learns to associate the sound or the graphic mark of this word with the
    thing that it designates. The term prosopopeia will frighten the student at
    first, but once he gets to the point where he can immediately associate the
    term with its significance, prosopopeia will be no more frightening to the stu-
    dent than the familiar terms metaphor and simile. We could, as the
    Renaissance rhetorician George Puttenham tried to do, invent English terms
    for the various figures, but since they would have to be coined terms, they
    would not necessarily be any easier to learn than the classical terms. However,
    wherever a familiar Anglicized term exists for a figure, we will use that
    term instead of the classical one.

    In any case, we must not look upon terminology as an end in itself. Just
    as we can speak and write our native language without knowing the names
    of the parts of speech, so we can use and respond to figurative language
    without knowing the names of the figures. Nomenclature, in any study, is
    a convenience for purposes of classification and discussion. But an awareness
    of the various figures of speech can increase our verbal resources, and if we
    make a conscious effort to learn the figures of speech, it is likely that we will
    resort to them more often.

    428 STYLE

    The Schemes

    SCHEMES OF WORDS

    We shall not dwell very long on schemes of words because while they occur
    frequently in poetry—especially in the poetry of earlier centuries—they rarely
    occur in prose. The schemes of words (sometimes called orthographical
    schemes, because they involve changes in the spelling or sound of words)
    are formed (1) by adding or subtracting a letter or a syllable at the begin-
    ning, middle, or end of a word, or (2) by exchanging sounds. Terms like
    the following are of more concern to the grammarian and the prosodist than
    to the rhetorician:

    prosthesis—adding a syllable in front of word—e.g. beloved for loved

    epenthesis—adding a syllable in the middle of word—e.g. visitating
    for visiting

    proparalepsis—adding a syllable at the end of word—e.g. climature
    for climate

    aphaeresis—subtracting a syllable from the beginning of word—e.g.
    neath for beneath

    syncope—subtracting a syllable from the middle of word—e.g. pros-
    prous for prosperous

    apocope—subtracting a syllable from the end of word—e.g. even
    for evening

    metathesis—transposition of letters in a word—e.g. clapse for clasp

    antistrophe—change of sound—e.g. wrang for wrong

    One can easily see that all of these involve a change in the shape or configuration of words. Poets used to employ such schemes to accommodate the rhyme or the rhythm of a line of verse. And because such changes are associated primarily with poetry, it is customary to regard such altered words as "poetic diction." Perhaps the situation in modern prose where we are most likely to use schemes of words would be the dialogue in a story. If a character in a story habitually clipped syllables from his words or mispronounced certain words, we might try to indicate those speech habits with spelling changes. Readers of Finnegan's Wake could supply numerous examples of other uses that James Joyce made of orthographical schemes in his remarkably ingenious prose.

    Parallelism is one of the basic principles of grammar and rhetoric. The
    principle demands that equivalent things be set forth in co-ordinate gram-
    matical structures. So nouns must be yoked with nouns, prepositional phrases
    with prepositional phrases, adverb clauses with adverb clauses. When this
    principle is ignored, not only is the grammar of co-ordination violated, but
    the rhetoric of coherence is wrenched. Students must be made to realize
    that violations of parallelism are serious, not only because they impair com-
    munication but because they reflect disorderly thinking. Whenever the stu-
    dent sees a co-ordinating conjunction in one of his sentences, he should check
    to make sure that the elements joined by the conjunction are of the same
    grammatical kind. Such a check would prevent him from writing sentences
    like this: "He was jolly, a good talker, and even better as a drinker."

    When the parallel elements are similar not only in structure but in length
    (that is, the same number of words, even the same number of syllables), the
    scheme is called isocolon. For example: His purpose was to impress the ig-
    norant, to perplex the dubious, and to confound the scrupulous. The addition
    of symmetry of length to similarity of structure contributes greatly to the
    rhythm of sentences. Obviously, the student should not strive for isocolon
    every time he produces parallel structure. Such regularity of rhythm would
    approach the recurrent beat of verse.

    The Schemes

    SCHEMES OF WORDS

    We shall not dwell very long on schemes of words because while they occur
    frequently in poetry—especially in the poetry of earlier centuries—they rarely
    occur in prose. The schemes of words (sometimes called orthographical
    schemes, because they involve changes in the spelling or sound of words)
    are formed (1) by adding or subtracting a letter or a syllable at the begin-
    ning, middle, or end of a word, or (2) by exchanging sounds. Terms like
    the following are of more concern to the grammarian and the prosodist than
    to the rhetorician:

    prosthesis—adding a syllable in front of word—e.g. beloved for loved

    epenthesis—adding a syllable in the middle of word—e.g. visitating

    aphaeresis—subtracting a syllable from the beginning of word—e.g.

    syncope—subtracting a syllable from the middle of word—e.g. pros-
    prous for prosperous

    apocope—subtracting a syllable from the end of word—e.g. even

    metathesis—transposition of letters in a word—e.g. clapse for clasp

    ANTITHESIS—the juxtaposition of contrasting ideas, often in parallel structure.

    Examples: Contempt is the proper punishment of affectation, and detestation
    the just consequence of hypocrisy.

    Many things difficult to design prove easy to perform.

    If you are pleased with prognostics of good, you will be terrified
    likewise with tokens of evil.

    If of Dryden's fire the blaze is brighter, of Pope's the heat is more

    regular and constant.

    All of these examples are quoted from Dr. Johnson, in whose prose, antithesis
    is such a pronounced feature that we have come to associate this structural
    device with his name. But antithesis was a scheme greatly admired by all
    the rhetoricians.

    It was the unknown author of Rhetorica ad Alexandrum who most clearly
    pointed up the fact that the opposition in an antithesis can reside either in
    the words or in the ideas or in both:

    An antithesis occurs when both the wording and the sense, or one or
    other of them, are opposed in a contrast. The following would be an
    antithesis both of wording and sense: "It is not fair that my opponent
    should become rich by possessing what belongs to me, while I sacrifice
    my property and become a mere beggar." In the following sentence we
    have a merely verbal antithesis: "Let the rich and prosperous give to the
    poor and needy"; and an antithesis of sense only in the following: "I
    tended him when he was sick, but he has been the cause of very great
    misfortune to me." Here there is no verbal antithesis, but the two actions
    are contrasted. The double antithesis (that is, both of sense and of word)
    would be the best to use; but the other two kinds are also true
    antitheses. (From Rhetorica ad Alexandrum, Ch. 26, trans. E. S. Forster.)

    Nicely managed, antithesis can produce the effect of aphoristic neatness and
    can win for the author a reputation for wit. Antithesis is obviously related
    to the topic of dissimilarity and the topic of contraries. (See the analysis of
    antithesis in Clark Kerr's sentence.)

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: 'ANTITHESIS IN LITERARY ANALYSIS\n\nExamine the following two sentences and identify the type of antithesis present in each:\n1. "It is not fair that my opponent should become rich by possessing what belongs to me, while I sacrifice my property and become a mere beggar."\n2.

    2. Schemes of unusual or inverted word order (hyperbaton)

    ANASTROPHE— inversion of the natural or usual word order.

    Examples: Backward run the sentences, till reels the mind. (From a parody of the style of Time Magazine.)

    With folly no man is willing to confess himself very intimately acquainted.—Dr. Johnson

    People that he had known all his life he didn't really know.—student theme

    Perfectly does anastrophe conform to our definition of a scheme as "an artful deviation from the ordinary pattern or arrangement of words." Because such deviation surprises expectation, anastrophe can be an effective device for gaining attention. But its chief function is to secure emphasis. It is a commonplace that the beginning and end of a clause are the positions of greatest emphasis. Words placed in those positions draw special attention, and when those initial or terminal words are not normally found in those positions, they receive extraordinary emphasis.

    PARENTHESIS—insertion of some verbal unit in a position that interrupts the normal syntactical flow of the sentence.

    Examples: But wherein any man is bold—I am speaking foolishly—I also am bold.... Are they ministers of Christ? I—to speak as a fool—am more.—St. Paul, 2 Cor. 11, 21 and 23

    He tried—who could do more?—to restrain the fury of the mob.

    The extraordinary number of bills passed during that session (312 of them) did not speak well of the Congressmen's capacity for deliberation.

    The distinguishing mark of parenthesis is that the interpolated member is "cut off" from the syntax of the rest of the sentence. A parenthesis abruptly — and usually briefly — sends the thought off on a tangent. Although the parenthetical matter is not necessary for the grammatical completeness of the sentence, it does have a pronounced rhetorical effect. For a brief moment, we hear the author's voice, commenting, editorializing, and, for that reason, the sentence gets an emotional charge that it would otherwise not have. Note, for instance, the difference in effect if the parenthetical element in St. Paul's first sentence is syntactically integrated with the rest of the sentence: "But I am speaking foolishly if I claim that wherein any man is bold."

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Anastrophe and Parenthesis in Rhetorical Effect**\n\nAnalyze the following two sentences from different authors and explain how they employ anastrophe and parenthesis to achieve rhetorical effect:\n1. "Backward run the sentences, till reels the mind." (Parody of Time Magazine)\n2. "The distinguishing mark of parenthesis is that the interpolated member is ''cut off'' from the syntax of the rest of the sentence." (Corbett)\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the rhetorical device used in each sentence (anastrophe for the first, parenthesis for the second).\n- **Part B**: Explain how each device creates emphasis or alters the reader''s interpretation. For example, in the first sentence, the inversion of word order emphasizes the unexpectedness of the statement.\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast how anastrophe and parenthesis function in their respective sentences, highlighting the difference in their focus (emphasis vs. tangential commentary).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the definitions and functions of both rhetorical devices as presented in the text, with clear examples from the provided sentences.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Creative Application of Parenthesis in a Rhetorical Context**\n\nConstruct a sentence that uses parenthesis to convey an unexpected or humorous comment, similar to the example: "He tried—who could do more?—to restrain the fury of the mob."\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Write your original sentence, ensuring that the parenthesis is properly integrated and creates a rhetorical effect.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the parenthetical element functions in your sentence, referencing the text''s description of parenthesis as ''cut off'' from the syntax and creating a brief tangent.\n- **Part C**: Compare your sentence to the example provided, highlighting how the use of parenthesis achieves a similar effect in terms of tone and reader engagement.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must be original, clearly demonstrate the use of parenthesis as a rhetorical device, and your explanation must align with the text''s analysis of parenthesis.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Rhetorical Devices**\n\nThe text describes anastrophe as a device that ''surprises expectation'' and emphasizes initial or terminal words. Using this definition, answer the following questions:\n1. Why does the sentence "People that he had known all his life he didn''t really know." (a student theme) use anastrophe to emphasize its meaning?\n2. How does the sentence "The extraordinary number of bills passed during that session (312 of them) did not speak well of the Congressmen''s capacity for deliberation." use parenthesis to add a contrasting or clarifying comment?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your responses must directly reference the text''s definitions of anastrophe and parenthesis, explaining how each device serves its rhetorical purpose as described in the passage.'

    **432 STYLE**

    Apposition—placing side by side two co-ordinate elements, the second of which serves as an explanation or modification of the first.

    Examples: John Morgan, the president of the Sons of the Republic, could not be reached by phone.

    A great many second-rate poets, in fact, are second-rate just for this reason, that they have not the sensitiveness and consciousness to perceive that they feel differently from the preceding generation and therefore must use words differently.—T. S. Eliot

    Men of this kind—soldiers of fortune, pool-hall habitués, gigolos, beachcombers—expend their talents on trivialities.

    Apposition is such a common method of expansion in modern prose that it hardly seems to conform to our definition of a scheme as "an artful deviation from the ordinary patterns of speech." But if one reflects upon his own experience, he will have to acknowledge that appositional structures seldom occur in impromptu speech. Apposition may not be the exclusive property of written prose, but it certainly occurs most frequently in written prose— in a situation, in other words, where we have time to make a conscious choice of our arrangement of words. So there is something artful about the use of the appositive. And there is something out-of-the-ordinary about the appositive, too. Although the appositive does not disturb the natural flow of the sentence as violently as parenthetical expressions do (mainly because the appositive is grammatically co-ordinate with the unit that it follows), it does interrupt the flow of the sentence, interrupts the flow to supply some gratuitous information or explanation.

    3. Schemes of Omission
    Expository—deliberate omission of a word or of words which are readily implied by the context.
    Examples: And he to England shall along with you—Hamlet, III, iii, 4

    As with religion, so with education. In colonial New England, education was broad-based, but nevertheless elitist; and in its basic assumptions, intellectualist—David Marquand, Encounter (March 1964)
    When in doubt, play trumps.

Eliot''s quote: \"A great many second-rate poets, in fact, are second-rate just for this reason, that they have not the sensitiveness and consciousness to perceive that they feel differently from the preceding generation and therefore must use words differently.\"\n- **Step 1**: Identify two instances of apposition in the quote and explain their function.\n- **Step 2**: Discuss how this structure contributes to the overall tone and message of the passage.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this usage with the example from "Men of this kind..." and explain how both use apposition to convey different aspects of the text''s theme.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must clearly demonstrate an understanding of apposition as defined in the text and its impact on literary interpretation.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Expository Schemes in Rhetorical Analysis**\n\nThe text describes expository schemes as deliberate omissions of words that are implied by context. Using the quote from Hamlet: \"And he to England shall along with you\" (III, iii, 4), analyze how the omission of certain words affects the meaning and stylistic purpose of the sentence.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the implied words that are omitted in the quote and explain their possible content.\n- **Step 2**: Compare this with the expository scheme in the quote about education in colonial New England. Discuss how both examples use omission to create meaning without explicit statement.\n- **Step 3**: Reflect on the role of expository schemes in shaping the reader''s interpretation of the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate the concept of expository schemes as defined in the text and show how omission contributes to rhetorical effect.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Schemes**\n\nThe text presents apposition and expository schemes as distinct rhetorical devices. Construct a paragraph that demonstrates how these two schemes can be combined in a single sentence to convey a complex message.\n- **Step 1**: Create a sentence that uses both apposition and expository schemes.\n- **Step 2**: Identify the elements of each scheme within your sentence and explain their functions.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss how the combination of these schemes enhances the clarity and impact of the sentence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both schemes as defined in the text and show how they work together to achieve a rhetorical effect.'

    Ellipsis can be an artful and arresting means of securing economy of expression. We must see to it, however, that the understood words are grammatically compatible. If we wrote, "The ringleader was hanged, and his accomplices imprisoned," we would be guilty of a solecism, because the understood was is not grammatically compatible with the plural subject (accomplices) of the second clause. And we produce a "howler" if we say, "While in the fourth grade, my father took me to the zoo."

    AsyNDEToN—deliberate omission of conjunctions between a series of related clauses.

    Examples: I came, I saw, I conquered.

    They may have it in well-doing, they may have it in learning, they may have it even in criticism—Matthew Arnold

    The infantry plodded forward, the tanks rattled into position, the big guns swung their snouts toward the rim of the hills, the planes raked the underbrush with gunfire.

    The Tudor rhetoricians had a special name for the omission of conjunctions between single words or phrases. They would have labelled the following as instances of brachylogia:

    ...and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth—Abraham Lincoln

    ... that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty —John F. Kennedy

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Ellipsis and Grammatical Compatibility\n\nExplain the grammatical incompatibility in the sentence: ''While in the fourth grade, my father took me to the zoo.'' According to the text, ellipsis can be used when understood words are grammatically compatible. However, in this case, the omission of a conjunction leads to a grammatical error.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the error in this sentence using the text''s definition of ellipsis.\n- **Step 2**: Compare it to the example given in the text: ''I came, I saw, I conquered.'' Explain why this sentence is grammatically correct.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your reasoning by referencing the text''s explanation of how understood words must be grammatically compatible.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly address the grammatical incompatibility and explain why the example with ''I came, I saw, I conquered'' is valid under ellipsis rules.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Application of Brachylogia in Rhetorical Composition\n\nConstruct a sentence using the concept of brachylogia (deliberate omission of conjunctions) as defined in the text. Your sentence must:\n- **Part A**: Be a compound sentence with at least three related clauses.\n- **Part B**: Demonstrate that the omitted conjunctions are grammatically compatible with the structure of the sentence.\n- **Part C**: Reference at least one example from the text (e.g., Lincoln''s or Kennedy''s quotes) to show how your sentence follows the same rhetorical pattern.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must be grammatically correct and demonstrate a clear understanding of brachylogia as outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Logical Reasoning with Ellipsis and Rhetorical Style\n\nAnalyze the following passage: ''The infantry plodded forward, the tanks rattled into position, the big guns swung their snouts toward the rim of the hills, the planes raked the underbrush with gunfire.''\n- **Part A**: Identify how ellipsis is used in this passage. According to the text, ellipsis can be an artful means of securing economy of expression.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the omission of conjunctions (brachylogia) contributes to the rhetorical effect. Use examples from the text to support your explanation.\n- **Part C**: Compare this passage to Lincoln''s quote: ''that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.'' Explain how both use ellipsis but serve different rhetorical purposes.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate the text''s definitions of ellipsis and brachylogia, and demonstrate an understanding of their role in rhetorical composition.'

    But there seems to be no good reason why we cannot use the single term asyndeton for all these instances of omission of conjunctions. The principal effect of asyndeton is to produce a hurried rhythm in the sentence. Aristotle observed that asyndeton was especially appropriate for the conclusion of a discourse, because there, perhaps more than in any other place in the discourse, we may want to produce the emotional reaction that can be stirred by, among other means, rhythm. And Aristotle concluded his Rhetoric with an instance of asyndeton that is noticeable even in translation: "I have done. You have heard me. The facts are before you. I ask for your judgment." The opposite scheme is polysyndeton (deliberate use of many conjunctions). Note how the proliferation of conjunctions in the following quotation slows up the rhythm of the prose and produces an impressively solemn note:

    And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds." And it was so. And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.—Genesis, 1:24-25

    Ernest Hemingway uses polysyndeton to create another effect. Note how the repeated and's in the following passage suggest the flow and continuity of experience:

    I said, "Who killed him?" and he said, "I don't know who killed him but he's dead all right," and it was dark and there was water standing in the street and no lights and windows broke and boats all up in the town and trees blown down and everything all blown and I got a skiff and went out and found my boat where I had her inside Mango Key and she was all right only she was full of water—Hemingway, "After the Storm"

    Polysyndeton can also be used to produce special emphasis. Note the difference in effect of these two sentences:

    4. Schemes of Repetition

    ALLITERATION—repetition of initial or medial consonants in two or more adjacent words.

    Examples: The moan of doves in immemorial elms
    And murmuring of innumerable bees,—Tennyson, The Princess

    After life's fitful fever he sleeps well—Macbeth, II], 1i, 22

    It is lawful to picket premises for the purpose of peacefully persuad-
    ing persons to refrain from trespassing.

    In Anglo-Saxon poetry, alliteration rather than rhyme was the device to bind
    verses together. Because it contributes to the euphony of verse or prose, alliter-
    ation became a conspicuous feature of Euphistic prose and Romantic poetry.
    Because it is such an obvious mannerism, alliteration is rarely used in modern
    prose. It is sometimes used today, however, for special effects—as a mnemonic
    device for slogans (Better Business Builds Bigger Bankrolls) and advertising
    catch-lines (Spark/ing ...Flavorful... Miller High Life... The Champagne
    of Bottle Beer... Brewed only in Milwaukee. Sometimes alliteration is de-
    liberately used for humorous effect: He was a preposterously pompous pro-
    ponent of precious pedantry.

    THE SCHEMES 435

    ASSONANCE—the repetition of similar vowel sounds, preceded and followed
    by different consonants, in the stressed syllables of adjacent words.

    Example: An old, mad, blind, despised, and dying king—
    Princes, the dregs of their dull race, who flow
    Through public scorn—mud from a muddy spring—
    —Shelley, "Sonnet: England in 1819"

    Assonance, a device of sound, like alliteration, is used mainly in poetry. A
    prose writer might deliberately use assonance to produce certain onomato-
    poetic or humorous effects. The danger for the prose writer, however, lies in
    the careless repetition of similar vowel-sounds, producing awkward jingles
    like this: "He tries to revise the evidence supplied by his eyes."

    ANAPHORA—repetition of the same word or group of words at the beginnings
    of successive clauses.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..

    King forever. The Lord shall give strength unto his people. The

    This is the essence—this is the heart—this is the day-to-day stuff of
    our duty in this Assembly as we see it: to build mightier mansions,
    to keep strengthening the United Nations—Adlai E. Stevenson

    Whenever anaphora occurs, we can be sure that the author has used it deliberately. Since the repetition of the words helps to establish a marked rhythm in the sequence of clauses, this scheme is usually reserved for those
    passages where the author wants to produce a strong emotional effect. Note
    how Reinhold Niebuhr combines anaphora with plays on words to produce this neat aphorism: "Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible;
    but man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary."

    Epistrophe—repetition of the same word or group of words at the ends of
    successive clauses.

    Examples: Shylock: I will have my bond! Speak not against my bond!
    I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond!
    —Merchant of Venice, II, iii, 3-4

    nobody was proud of—Walter Bagehot

    He's learning fast. Are you earning fast?—Advertisement for Aetna

    Epistrophe not only sets up a pronounced rhythm but secures a special em-
    phasis, both by repeating the word and by putting the word in the final
    position in the sentence.

    EPANALEPSIS—repetition at the end of a clause of the word that occurred at
    the beginning of the clause.

    Example: Blood hath bought blood, and blows have answer'd blows:
    Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power.

    —Shakespeare, King John, III, i, 329-30

    Epanalepsis is rare in prose, probably because when the emotional situation
    arises that can make such a scheme appropriate, poetry seems to be the only
    form that can adequately express the emotion. It would seem perfectly nat-
    ural for a father to express his grief over the death of a beloved son in this
    fashion: "He was flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone, blood of my blood."
    But would the father be speaking prose or poetry? Perhaps the only answer
    we could give is that it is heightened language of some sort, the kind of lan-
    guage which, despite its appearance of contrivance, springs spontaneously
    from intense emotion. Repetition, we know, is one of the characteristics of
    highly emotional language. And in this instance what better way for the
    father to express the intimacy of the relationship with his son than by the
    repetition of words at the beginning and end of successive groups of words?

    Perhaps the best general advice about the use of epanalepsis—in fact of all
    those schemes that are appropriate only to extraordinary circumstances—
    would be, "If you find yourself consciously deciding to use epanalepsis, don't
    use it." When the time is appropriate, the scheme will present itself unbidden.

    ANADIPLosis—repetition of the last word of one clause at the beginning of
    the following clause.

    Examples: Labor and care are rewarded with success, success produces con-
    fidence, confidence relaxes industry, and negligence ruins the repu-
    tation which diligence had raised—Dr. Johnson, Rambler No. 21

    Climax can be considered a scheme of repetition only when, as in the first
    example quoted above, it is a continued anadiplosis involving three or more
    members. Otherwise, as in the second and third examples, it is simply a
    scheme which arranges a series in an order of gradually rising importance.
    This latter variety of climax can be looked upon as a scheme related to the
    topic of degree, and it is the kind of climax that the student will most often

    From President Kennedy's Inaugural Address, would it have been so often quoted if it had read something like this: "Do not ask what America can do for you. You would do better to ask whether your country stands in need of your services"? The "magic" has now gone out of the appeal. It would be a profitable exercise for the student to take several of the schemes presented in this section and convert them into ordinary prose. Such an exercise would undoubtedly reveal what the schemes add to the expression of the thought.

    Similar to antimetabole is the scheme called chiasmus ("the criss-cross"). Chiasmus reverses the grammatical structures in successive clauses, but unlike antimetabole, does not repeat the words. Example: "I am indisposed to work, but to beg I am ashamed." Both antimetabole and chiasmus can be used to reinforce antithesis.

    Polyptoton—repetition of words derived from the same root.

    Examples: The Greeks are strong, and skilful to their strength,
    Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;

    (metaphor)

    We shall treat of metaphor and simile together because they are so much
    alike. The difference between metaphor and simile lies mainly in the manner
    of expressing the comparison. Whereas metaphor says, "David was a lion in
    battle," simile says, "David was like a lion in battle." Both of these tropes are
    related to the topic of similarity, for although the comparison is made be-
    tween two things of unlike nature (David and lion), there is some respect in
    which they are similar (e.g., they are courageous, or they fight ferociously, or
    they are unconquerable in a fight). The thing with which the first thing is
    compared is to be understood in some "transferred sense": David is not liter-
    ally a lion, but he is a lion in some "other sense."

    An extended or continued metaphor is known as an allegory. We see one
    of these sustained metaphors in The Battle of the Books, where Jonathan
    Swift compares the classical writers, not to the spider, which spins its web
    out of its own entrails, but to the far-ranging bee:

    As for us the ancients, we are content with the bee to pretend to nothing
    of our own, beyond our wings and our voices, that is to say, our flights
    and our language. For the rest, whatever we have got has been by in-
    finite labor and search, and ranging through every corner of nature; the
    difference is that instead of dirt and poison, we have chosen to fill our
    hives with honey and wax, thus furnishing mankind with the two noblest
    of things, which are sweetness and light.

    Closely allied to this form of extended metaphor is parable, an anecdotal
    narrative designed to teach a moral lesson. The most famous examples of
    parable are those found in the New Testament. In the parable of the sower
    of seeds, for instance, our interest is not so much in the tale of a man who
    went out to sow some seeds as in what each detail of the anecdote "stands
    for," in what the details "mean." Whenever the disciples were puzzled about
    what a particular parable meant, they asked Christ to interpret it for them.

    And while we are talking about these analogical tropes, we should warn
    the student to be on his guard against the "mixed metaphor," which results
    when he loses sight of the terms of his comparison. When Joseph Addison
    said, "There is not a single view of human nature which is not sufficient to
    extinguish the seeds of pride," it is obvious that he is mixing two different
    metaphors. We could say "to extinguish the flames of pride" or "to water
    the seeds of pride," but we cannot mix the notion of extinguishing with that
    of seeds. The rhetoricians sometimes called such "wrenching of words"
    catachresis.

    SYNECDOCHE—a figure of speech in which a part stands for the whole.
    Examples:

    genus substituted for the species:
    vessel for ship, weapon for sword, creature for man, arms for rifles,
    vehicle for bicycle

    species substituted for the genus:
    bread for food, cutthroat for assassin

    part substituted for the whole:
    sail for ship, hands for helpers, roofs for houses

    matter for what is made from it:
    silver for money, canvas for sail, steel for sword

    In general, we have an instance of synecdoche when the part or genus or adjunct that is mentioned suggests something else. It is an oblique manner of speaking. All of the following illustrate this trope: "Give us this day our daily bread." "All hands were summoned to the quarter-deck." "Not marble, nor the gilded monuments of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme." "They braved the waves to protect their fatherland." "Brandish your steel, men." "Are there no roofs in this town that will harbor an honorable man?" "It is pleasing to contemplate a manufacture rising gradually from its first mean state by the successive JABORS of innumerable minds."—Johnson, Rambler No. g. "The door closed upon the extempore surgeon and midwife, and Roaring Camp sat down outside, smoked its pipe, and awaited the issue."—Bret Harte, "The Luck of Roaring Camp."

    Metonymy—substitution of some attributive or suggestive word for what is actually meant.

    Examples: crown for royalty, mitre for bishop, wealth for rich people, brass for military officers, bottle for wine, pen for writers

    THE TROPES 441

    Metonymy and synecdoche are so close to being the same trope that George Campbell, the eighteenth-century rhetorician, wondered whether we should make any great effort to distinguish them. Those rhetoricians who did make the effort to discriminate these tropes would label the following as examples of metonymy:

    He slinks out of the way of the humblest petticoat—G. B. Shaw

    As if the kitchen and the nursery were less important than the office in the city —G. B. Shaw

    "Who is this Son of Man?" Jesus said to them, "The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light lest the darkness overtake you."—John 13, 34-5

    He addressed his remarks to the chair.
    He was addicted to the Jotztle.
    Yesterday I sold a Rembrandt.

    If the nearness of our last necessity brought a nearer conformity into it, there were happiness in hoary hairs and no calamity in half senses —Sir Thomas Browne

    In Europe, we gave the cold shoulder to De Gaulle, and now he
    gives the warm hand to Mao Tse-tung.—Richard Nixon

    Puns—generic name for those figures which make a play on words.

    (1) Antanaclasis—repetition of a word in two different senses.

    Learn a craft so that when you grow older you will not have to
    earn your living by craft.

    Never serve the coffee without the cream—Harvey's Bristol
    Cream (advertising slogan)

    (2) Paronomasia—use of words alike in sound but different in
    meaning.

    It was a foul act to steal my fowl.
    RCA—A sound tradition (advertisement for a stereo set).

    (3) Syllepsis—use of a word understood differently in relation to
    two or more other words, which it modifies or governs.

    He jost his hat and his temper.

    Here thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey
    Dost sometimes counsel take—and sometimes tea.—Alexander Pope

    442 STYLE

    The figure of zeugma is somewhat like syllepsis, but whereas in syllepsis the
    single word is grammatically and idiomatically compatible with both of the
    other words that it governs, in a zeugma the single word does not fit gram-
    matically or idiomatically with one member of the pair. If we say, "Jane has
    murdered her father, and may you too" or "He maintained a flourishing
    business and racehorse," we would be producing an instance of zeugma,
    because in both sentences the underlined word is either grammatically or
    idiomatically incongruous with one member (in these examples, the second
    member) of the pair it governs. Those two lines from Pope's Rape of the
    Lock which are often classified as zeugma—"Or stain her honour, or her
    new brocade" and "Or lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball"—would,
    according to our definition, be examples of syllepsis. Syllepsis is the only one of
    these two figures which can be considered a form of pun. Zeugma, if skill-
    fully managed, could be impressive as a display of wit, but often enough,
    zeugma is nothing more than a faulty use of the scheme of ellipsis.

    ANTHIMERIA—the substitution of one part of speech for another.

    Examples: Vl unhair thy head—Shakespeare, Antony and Cleopatra, Ul,
    v. 64

    A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
    The way into her mercy.—Shakespeare, Coriolanus, V, i, 5

    The thunder would not peace at my bidding—Shakespeare, King
    Lear, IV, vi, 103

    Dozens of other examples of anthimeria could be quoted from Shakespeare's
    plays. If a word was not available for what he wanted to express, Shake-
    speare either coined a word or used an old word in a new way. Today's
    writer must use anthimeria seldom and with great discretion unless he is
    truly a master of the existing English language. On the other hand, an apt
    creation can be pungent, evocative, witty, or memorable. English today is a
    rich, flexible language, because words have been borrowed, changed, and
    created. Think of all the ways in which a word like smoke has been used
    since it first came into the language:

    The smoke rose from the chimney.
    The chimney smokes.

    He smoked the ham.

    He smokes.

    He asked for a smoke.

    He objected to the smoke nuisance.
    He noticed the smoky atmosphere.

    THE IROPES 443

    He tried smoking on the sly.

    He smoked out the thief.

    His dreams went up in smoke.

    The Ferrari smoked along the wet track.

    Someday someone will say, if it hasn't been said already, "He looked at her
    smokily."

    PERIPHRASIS (antonomasia)—substitution of a descriptive word or phrase for
    a proper name or of a proper name for a quality associated with the name.

    Examples: The Splendid Splinter hit two more round-trippers today.

    The Negro does not escape Jim Crow when he moves into a higher-
    income bracket.

    She may not have been a Penelope, but she was not as unfaithful as
    the gossips made her out to be.

    When his swagger is exhausted, he drivels into erotic poetry or sen-
    timental uxoriousness. And the Tennysonian King Arthur posing at
    Guinevere becomes Don Quixote grovelling before Dulcinea.—

    The frequency with which we meet this trope, even in modern prose, is evidence of the urge in man to express familiar ideas in uncommon ways. Circumlocutions and tags can become tiresome clichés (as they often do on the sports page), but when they display a fresh, decorous inventiveness, they can add grace to our writing. It is the trite or overly ingenious oblique expression that wearies the reader.

    PERSONIFICATION (prosopoeia)—investing abstractions or inanimate objects with human qualities or abilities.

    Examples: The ground thirsts for rain.
    The very stones cry out for revenge.

    Can Honor's voice provoke the silent dust,

    Or Flatt'ry sooth the dull cold ear of Death? —Thomas Gray

    Personification is such a familiar figure that there is no need to multiply examples of it. This is one of the figures that should be reserved for passages designed to stir the emotions. Another emotional figure, closely allied to personification, is apostrophe (addressing an absent person or a personified abstraction). Here is an example of apostrophe from Sir Walter Raleigh's History of the World:

    O eloquent, just, and mighty Death! whom none could advise, thou hast persuaded; what none hath dared, thou hast done; and whom all the world has flattered, thou only hast cast out of the world and despised.
    Thou hast drawn together all the far-stretched greatness, all the pride,
    cruelty, and ambition of man, and covered it all with these two narrow
    words, Hic jacet.

    Hyperbole—the use of exaggerated terms for the purpose of emphasis or heightened effect.

    Examples: His eloquence would split rocks.

    It's really ironical...I have gray hair. I really do. The one side of
    my head—the right side—is full of millions of gray hairs—Holden
    Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye

    My left leg weighs three tons. It is embalmed in spices like a
    mummy. I can't move. I haven't moved for five thousand years. I'm
    of the time of Pharaoh—Thomas Bailey Aldrich, "Marjorie Daw"

    Hyperbole is so steadily droned into our ears that most of us have ceased to
    think of it as a figure of speech. Advertisers and teenagers can hardly talk
    without using superlatives. Perhaps we would not be so much amused by
    the Oriental greeting, "We welcome you, most honorable sir, to our miser-
    able abode," if we stopped to consider how exaggerated many of our forms
    of greeting, address, and compliment are.

    Hyperbole can be a serviceable figure of speech if we learn to use it with
    restraint and for a calculated effect. Under the stress of emotion, it will slip
    out naturally and will then seem appropriate. If we can learn to invent fresh
    hyperboles, we will be able to produce the right note of emphasis (as in the
    first example above) or humor (as in the quotation from Aldrich).

    Being related to the topic of degree, hyperbole is like the figure called
    auxesis (magnifying the importance or gravity of something by referring to
    it with a disproportionate name). So a lawyer will try to impress a jury by
    referring to a scratch on the arm as "a wound" or to pilfering from the
    petty-cash box as "embezzlement." We can accept Mark Antony's reference
    to the wound that Brutus inflicted on Caesar as "the most unkindest cut of
    all,' but the occasion seemed not to warrant Senator Joseph McCarthy's
    classic remark, "That's the most unheard of thing I ever heard of."

    Lirores—deliberate use of understatement, not to deceive someone but to
    enhance the impressiveness of what we say.
    Examples: It was a not unhappy crowd that greeted the team at the airport.

    Scaliger's influence in France was not inconsiderable during the six-
    teenth century.—Joel E. Spingarn, Literary Criticism in the Renais-
    sance

    Litotes is a form of meiosis (a lessening). The same lawyer whom we saw
    in the previous section using auxesis might represent another of his clients
    by referring to a case of vandalism as "boyish highjinks." A rose by any other
    name will smell as sweet, but a crime, if referred to by a name that is not
    too patently disproportionate, may lose some of its heinousness.

    RHETORICAL QUESTION (erotema)—asking a question, not for the purpose of
    eliciting an answer but for the purpose of asserting or denying something

    obliquely.

    Examples: What! Gentlemen, was I not to foresee, or foreseeing was I not
    to endeavor to save you from all these multiplied mischiefs and dis-
    graces? ... Was I an Irishman on that day that I boldly withstood
    our pride? or on the day that I hung down my head and wept in
    shame and silence over the humiliation of Great Britain? I became
    unpopular in England for the one, and in Ireland for the other.
    What then? What obligation lay on me to be popular? —Edmund
    Burke, Speech in the Electors of Bristol

    Wasn't the cult of James a revealing symbol and symbol of an age and society which wanted to dwell like him in some false world of
    false art and false culture? —Maxwell Geismar, Henry James and
    The Cult

    The rhetorical question is a common device in impassioned speeches, but
    it can be used too in written prose. It can be an effective persuasive device,
    subtly influencing the kind of response one wants to get from an audience.
    The manner in which the question is phrased can determine either a nega-
    tive or an affirmative response. If we say, "Was this an act of heroism?" the
    audience will respond, in the proper context, with a negative answer. By
    inducing the audience to make the appropriate response, the rhetorical ques-
    tion can often be more effective as a persuasive device than a direct assertion
    would be.

    Irony—use of a word in such a way as to convey a meaning opposite to the
    literal meaning of the word.

    Examples: For Brutus is an honourable man;
    So are they all, all honourable men.—Shakespeare, Julius Caesar,

But this objection is, I think, a little unworthy of so refined an age as ours——Swift, Argument Against the Abolishing of Christianity  \n\nAs a trope which quite definitely conveys a \"transferred meaning,\" irony is related to the topic of contraries or the topic of contradiction. A highly sophisticated device, irony must be used with great caution. If one misjudges the intelligence of his audience, he may find that his audience is taking his words in their ostensible sense rather than in the intended opposite sense.  \n\nThe Tudor rhetoricians had a special name for the kind of irony in which one proposed to pass over some matter, yet managed subtly to reveal the matter anyway. They called this kind of irony paralipsis. A notable example of paralipsis is found in Mark Antony's famous \"Friends, Romans, countrymen\" speech in Julius Caesar:  \n\nLet but the commons hear this testament,  \nWhich (pardon me) I do not mean to read,  \nAnd they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds...  \nHave patience, gentle friends; I must not read it.  \n\nIt is not meet you know how Caesar lov'd you....  \n\"Tis good you know not that you are his heirs.  \n\n(IIT, ii, 136-51)  \n\nA look at the entire speech will show how Antony, despite his disclaimers, managed to let the mob know what was in Caesar's last will.  \n\nONoMATOPOEIA—uSe of words whose sound echoes the sense.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

    And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;
    But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,

    The spray was hissing hot, and a huge jet of water burst up from
    its midst.

    In the passage quoted above from Pope, some of the onomatopoetic effects
    are produced by the rhythm of the lines as well as by the sounds of words.
    Since onomatopoeia seeks to match sound with sense, it is easy to see why
    this figure was commonly associated with the topic of similarity. Onoma-
    topoeia will be used much less frequently in prose than in poetry, yet it still
    has its appropriate uses in prose. Wherever sound-effects can be used to set
    the emotional or ethical tone of a passage, onomatopoeia can make a contri-
    bution. In seeking to discredit a person or an act, we could reinforce the
    effect of pejorative diction with cacophony. In a phrase like "a dastardly epi-
    sode," we reveal our attitude toward the event not only by the unpleasant
    connotations of the word dastardly but also by the harsh sound of the word.

    By thus combining contradictories, the writer produces a startling effect, and
    he may, if his oxymorons are fresh and apt, win for himself a reputation for
    wit. There is displayed in this figure, as in most metaphorical language,
    what Aristotle considered a special mark of genius: the ability to see simi-
    larities. Here are some examples of oxymoron:

    Concluding Remarks on the Figures of Speech

    A knowledge of the figures that have been presented in this chapter will
    not insure that the student will be able to invent his own figures or that
    when he uses figures he will use them aptly and efficaciously. The benefit
    from such an investigation is rather that having been made aware of the
    various schemes and tropes the student may make a conscious effort to use
    figures when he sees that they will suit his purpose. In acquiring any skill,
    we must at first do consciously what experts do automatically; or, as Dr.
    Johnson said, "What we hope ever to do with ease, we must learn first to
    do with diligence." And during this period of apprenticeship, we can expect
    to do awkwardly what experts do smoothly. With practice, however, we will

    arrive at that happy state of naturalness that Longinus spoke of in On the
    Sublime:

    Wherefore a figure is at its best when the very fact that it is a figure
    escapes attention....For art is perfect when it seems to be nature, and
    nature hits the mark when she contains art hidden within her.

- prompt: "Up to this point we have been dealing with the precepts of style. Now we  \nwill move on to the second of the ways in which one learns to write or to  \nimprove his writing—imitation. Classical rhetoric books are filled with testi-  \nmonies about the value of imitation for the refinement of the many skills  \ninvolved in effective speaking or writing. Style is, after all, the most imitable  \nof the skills that co-operate to produce effective discourse.  \n\nRhetoricians recommended a variety of exercises to promote conscious imi-  \ntation. Roman schoolboys, for example, were regularly set the task of trans-  \nlating Greek passages into Latin and vice versa. In some of the Renaissance  \nschools in England, schoolboys worked back and forth between Greek and  \nLatin and English. Schoolmasters—the better ones anyway—were aware  \nthat grammatical differences among these three languages necessitated  \ncertain stylistic adjustments in the translation from one language to another.  \nDespite these differences, however, students did learn from this exercise many  \nvaluable lessons about sentence structure.  \n\nAnother exercise imposed on schoolboys was the practice of paraphrasing  \npoetry into prose. Here again many adjustments in style had to be made.  \nBesides teaching students the salient differences between the poetic medium  \nand the prose medium, this exercise made students pay close attention to the  \npotentialities of precise, concrete diction, of emphatic disposition of words,  \nand of figures of speech. Even today there are those who maintain that the  \nbest way to improve one's prose style is to study or write poetry.  \n\nAnother common practice was to set the students the task of saying some-  \nthing in a variety of ways. This process usually started out with a model  \nsentence, which had to be converted into a variety of forms each retaining  \nthe basic thought of the original. Erasmus, for instance, in Chapter 33 of his  \nwidely-used little book, De duplici copia verborum ac rerum, showed the  \nstudents 150 ways of phrasing the Latin sentence, Tuae literae me magnopere  \ndelectarunt (Your letter has delighted me very much). This variety was  \nachieved partly by the choice of different words, partly by different colloca-  \ntions of words. Here is a sampling of Erasmus's reworkings:  \n\nYour epistle has cheered me greatly.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."

    Your letter provided me with no little pleasure.

    Obviously, not all of the 150 sentences were equally satisfactory or ap-
    propriate; in fact, some of them were monstrosities. But by artificially ex-
    perimenting with various forms, the student becomes aware of the flexibility
    of the language in which he is working and learns to extend his own range.
    Ultimately he learns that although there is a variety of ways of saying some-
    thing, there is a "best way" for his particular subject matter, occasion, or
    audience. What was "best" for one occasion or audience, he discovers, is
    not "best" for another occasion or audience.

    This text will give the student the opportunity to practice two kinds of
    imitation—copying passages of prose and imitating various sentence patterns.
    But before we get into those exercises, we will present the testimony of some
    famous writers about how they learned to write. The student will see as he
    reads these testimonies how basic imitation is to the formation of style.

    One must first think and excogitate his matter, then choose his words, and examine the weight of either. Then take care, in placing and ranking both matter and words, that the composition be comely; and to do this with diligence and often. No matter how slow the style be at first, so it be laboured and accurate; seek the best, and be not glad of the forward conceits, or first words, that offer themselves to us; but judge of what we invent, and order what we approve. Repeat often what we have formerly written; which besides that it helps the consequence, and makes the juncture better, it quickens the heat of imagination, that often cools in the time of setting down, and gives it new strength, as if it grew lustier by the going back. As we see in the contention of leaping, they jump farthest that fetch their race longest; or, as in throwing a dart or javelin, we force back our arms to make our loose the stronger. Yet if we have a fair gale of wind, I forbid not the steering out of our sail, so the favour of the gale deceive us not. For all that we invent doth please us in the conception of birth, else we would never set it down. But the safest is to return to our judgment, and handle over again those things the easiness of which might make them justly suspected. So did the best writers in their beginnings; they imposed upon themselves care and industry; they did nothing rashly; they obtained first to write well, and then custom made it easy and a habit. By little and little their matter showed itself to them more plentifully; their words answered, their composition followed; and all, as in a well-ordered family, presented itself in the place. So that the sum of all is, ready writing makes not good writing, but good writing brings on ready writing.

    About this time I met with an odd volume of the Spectator. It was the third. I had never before seen any of them. I bought it, read it over and over, and was much delighted with it. I thought the writing excellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it. With this view I took some of the papers, and, making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, try'd to compleat the papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand. Then I compared my Spectator with the original, discovered some of my faults, and corrected them. But I found I wanted a stock of words, or a readiness in recalling and using them, which I thought I should have acquired before that time if I had gone on making verses; since the continual occasion for words of the same import, but of different length, to suit the measure, or

    of different sound for the rhyme, would have laid me under a constant necessity of searching for variety, and also have tended to fix that variety in my mind, and make me master of it. Therefore I took some of the tales and turned them into verse; and, after a time, when I had pretty well forgotten the prose, turned them back again. I also sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into confusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best order, before I began to form the full sentences and compleat the paper. This was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts. By comparing my work afterwards with the original, I discovered many faults and amended them; but I sometimes had the pleasure of fancying that, in certain particulars of small import, I had been lucky enough to improve the method or the language, and this encouraged me to think I might possibly in time come to be a tolerable English writer, of which I was extreamly ambitious.

    I continued in this unpretentious situation for nearly a year. However, by being so long in the lowest form [at Harrow] I gained an immense advantage over the cleverer boys. They all went on to learn Latin and Greek and splendid things like that. But I was taught English. We were considered such dunces that we could learn only English. Mr. Somervell—a most delightful man, to whom my debt is great—was charged with the duty of teaching the stupidest boys the most disregarded thing—namely, to write mere English. He knew how to do it. He taught it as no one else has ever taught it. Not only did we learn English parsing thoroughly, but we also practised continually English analysis. Mr. Somervell had a system of his own. He took a fairly long sentence and broke it up into its components by means of black, red, blue, and green inks. Subject, verb, object: Relative Clauses, Conditional Clauses, Conjunctive and Disjunctive Clauses! Each had its colour and its bracket. It was a kind of drill. We did it almost daily. As I remained in the Third Form (8) three times as long as anyone else, I had three times as much of it. I learned it thoroughly. Thus I got into my bones the essential structure of the ordinary British sentence—which is a noble thing. And when in after years my schoolfellows who had won prizes and distinction for writing such beautiful Latin poetry and pithy Greek epigrams had to come down again to common English, to earn their living or make their way, I did not feel myself at any disadvantage. Naturally I am biased in favour of

    boys learning English. I would make them all learn English: and then I

    As it is, I have had to teach myself. I have looked at the stories I wrote when
    I was very young in order to discover what natural aptitude I had, my origi-
    nal stock-in-trade, before I developed it by taking thought. The manner had
    a superciliousness that perhaps my years excused and an irascibility that was
    a defect of nature; but I am speaking now only of the way in which I
    expressed myself. It seems to me that I had a natural lucidity and a knack
    for writing easy dialogue.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Techniques in Early Writing**\n\nIn the passage, the author reflects on his early writing style and mentions having a "natural lucidity" and a "knack for writing easy dialogue." How does this reflect on the rhetorical principles of clarity and persuasion?\n- **Step 1**: Identify two rhetorical devices or concepts from classical rhetoric that are implied by the author''s description of his natural ability.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how these devices contribute to effective communication as described in classical rhetoric texts.\n- **Step 3**: Use the text''s mention of "natural lucidity" to argue why clear expression is a fundamental aspect of rhetorical skill.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate classical rhetoric principles and justify how the author''s natural abilities align with these concepts.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Concepts in Self-Reflection**\n\nThe author describes his "irascibility" as a defect of nature but acknowledges that it was excused by his years. How does this self-reflection relate to the classical rhetorical idea of *ethos* (credibility) and *pathos* (emotional appeal)?\n- **Part A**: Define *ethos* and *pathos* using classical rhetorical definitions.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how the author''s acknowledgment of his "irascibility" affects the reader''s perception of his credibility (ethos).\n- **Part C**: Explain how the author''s self-awareness of his character traits could be used to evoke *pathos* in a rhetorical context.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of both *ethos* and *pathos* as defined in classical rhetoric, with clear examples from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Rhetorical Development**\n\nThe author claims that his "original stock-in-trade" was his natural ability to express himself, which he developed through thought. How does this statement reflect on the relationship between innate talent and rhetorical learning?\n- **Part A**: Define *innate talent* and *rhetorical learning* using classical rhetorical terms.\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument that demonstrates how innate talent and learning are complementary in the development of rhetorical skill.\n- **Part C**: Provide an example from classical rhetoric where both innate ability and training are essential to achieving rhetorical excellence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate classical rhetoric principles and show a clear understanding of how natural aptitude and education contribute to effective communication.'

    When Henry Arthur Jones, then a well-known playwright, read my first
    novel, he told a friend that in due course I should be one of the most suc-
    cessful dramatists of the day. I suppose he saw in it directness and an effective
    way of presenting a scene that suggested a sense of the theatre. My language
    was commonplace, my vocabulary limited, my grammar shaky and my
    phrases hackneyed. But to write was an instinct that seemed as natural to
    me as to breathe, and I did not stop to consider if I wrote well or badly.
    It was not till some years later that it dawned upon me that it was a delicate
    art that must be painfully acquired. The discovery was forced upon me by
    the difficulty I found in getting my meaning down on paper. I wrote dialogue
    fluently, but when it came to a page of description I found myself entangled
    in all sorts of quandaries. I would struggle for a couple of hours over two
    or three sentences that I could in no way manage to straighten out. I made
    up my mind to teach myself how to write. Unfortunately I had no one to
    help me. I made many mistakes. If I had had someone to guide me like the
    charming don of whom I spoke just now I might have been saved much
    time. Such a one might have told me that such gifts as I had lay in one
    direction and that they must be cultivated in that direction; it was useless
    to try to do something for which I had no aptitude. But at that time a florid
    prose was admired. Richness of texture was sought by means of a jewelled
    phrase and sentences stiff with exotic epithets: the ideal was a brocade so
    heavy with gold that it stood up by itself. The intelligent young read Walter
    Pater with enthusiasm. My common sense suggested to me that it was
    anaemic stuff; behind those elaborate, gracious periods I was conscious of a

    Tired, wan personality. I was young, lusty and energetic; I wanted fresh air, action, violence, and I found it hard to breathe that dead, heavily scented atmosphere and sit in those hushed rooms in which it was indecorous to speak above a whisper. But I would not listen to my common sense. I persuaded myself that this was the height of culture and turned a scornful shoulder on the outside world where men shouted and swore, played the fool, whined and got drunk. I read *Intentions* and *The Picture of Dorian Gray*. I was intoxicated by the colour and rareness of the fantastic words that thickly stud the pages of *Salome*. Shocked by the poverty of my own vocabulary, I went to the British Museum with pencil and paper and noted down the names of curious jewels, the Byzantine hues of old enamels, the sensual feel of textiles, and made elaborate sentences to bring them in. Fortunately I could never find an opportunity to use them, and they lie there yet in an old notebook ready for anyone who has a mind to write nonsense.

    It was generally thought then that the Authorized Version of the Bible was the greatest piece of prose that the English language has produced. I read it diligently, especially the Song of Solomon, jotting down for future use turns of phrase that struck me and making lists of unusual or beautiful words. I studied Jeremy Taylor's *Holy Dying*. In order to assimilate his style I copied out passages and then tried to write them down from memory.

    The first fruit of this labour was a little book about Andalusia called The Land of the Blessed Virgin. I had occasion to read parts of it the other day. I know Andalusia a great deal better now than I knew it then, and I have changed my mind about a good many things of which I wrote. Since it has continued in America to have a small sale it occurred to me that it might be worth while to revise it. I soon saw that this was impossible. The book was written by someone I have completely forgotten. It bored me to distraction. But what I am concerned with is the prose, for it was as an exercise in style that I wrote it. It is wistful, allusive and elaborate. It has neither ease nor spontaneity. It smells of hothouse plants and Sunday dinner like the air in the greenhouse that leads out of the dining-room of a big house in Bayswater. There are a great many melodious adjectives. The vocabulary is sentimental. It does not remind one of an Italian brocade, with its rich pattern of gold, but of a curtain material designed by Burne-Jones and reproduced by Morris.

    I do not know whether it was a subconscious feeling that this sort of writing was contrary to my bent or a naturally methodical cast of mind that led me then to turn my attention to the writers of the Augustan Period. The prose of Swift enchanted me. I made up my mind that this was a perfect way to write, and I started to work on him in the same way as I had done

    With Jeremy Taylor. I chose *The Tale of a Tub*. It is said that when the Dean re-read it in his old age he cried: "What genius I had then!" To my mind his genius was better shown in other works. It is a tiresome allegory, and the irony is facile. But the style is admirable. I cannot imagine that English can be better written. Here are no flowery periods, fantastic turns of phrase or high-flown images. It is a civilized prose, natural, discreet and pointed. There is no attempt to surprise by an extravagant vocabulary. It looks as though Swift made do with the first word that came to hand, but since he had an acute and logical brain it was always the right one, and he put it in the right place. The strength and balance of his sentences are due to an exquisite taste. As I had done before, I copied passages and then tried to write them out again from memory. I tried altering words or the order in which they were set. I found that the only possible words were those Swift had used and that the order in which he had placed them was the only possible order. It is an impeccable prose.

- prompt: "But perfection has one grave defect: it is apt to be dull. Swift's prose is  \nlike a French canal, bordered with poplars, that runs through a gracious and  \nundulating country. Its tranquil charm fills you with satisfaction, but it  \nneither excites the emotions nor stimulates the imagination. You go on  \nand on and presently you are a trifle bored. So, much as you may admire  \nSwift's wonderful lucidity, his terseness, his naturalness, his lack of affecta-  \ntion, you find your attention wandering after a while unless his matter pecu-  \nlarly interests you. I think if I had my time over again I would give to the  \nprose of Dryden the close study I gave to that of Swift. I did not come across  \nit till I had lost the inclination to take so much pains. The prose of Dryden  \nis delicious. It has not the perfection of Swift nor the easy elegance of  \nAddison, but it has a springtime gaiety, a conversational ease, a blithe  \nspontaneousness that are enchanting. Dryden was a very good poet, but  \nit is not the general opinion that he had a lyrical quality; it is strange that  \nit is just this that sings in his softly sparkling prose. Prose had never been  \nwritten in England like that before; it has seldom been written like that  \nsince. Dryden flourished at a happy moment. He had in his bones the  \nsonorous periods and the baroque massiveness of Jacobean language, and  \nunder the influence of the nimble and well-bred felicity that he learnt from  \nthe French he turned it into an instrument that was fit not only for solemn  \nthemes but also to express the light thought of the passing moment. He wis  \nthe first of the rococo artists. If Swift reminds you of a French canal Dryden  \nrecalls an English river winding its cheerful way round hills, through quietly  \nbusy towns and by nestling villages, pausing now in a noble reach and then  \nrunning powerfully through a woodland country. It is alive, varied, wind  \nswept; and it has the pleasant open-air smell of England.\n\nThe work I did was certainly very good for me.

    I did not write well. I wrote stiffly and self-consciously. I tried to get a pattern into my sentences, but did not see that the pattern was evident. I took care how I placed my words, but did not reflect that an order that was natural at the beginning of the eighteenth century was most unnatural at the beginning of ours. My attempt to write in the manner of Swift made it impossible for me to achieve the effect of inevitable rightness that was just what I so much admired in him. I then wrote a number of plays and ceased to occupy myself with anything but dialogue. It was not till five years had passed that I set out again to write a novel. By then I no longer had any ambition to be a stylist; I put aside all thought of fine writing. I wanted to write without any frills of language, in as bare and unaffected a manner as I could. I had so much to say that I could afford to waste no words. I wanted merely to set down the facts. I began with the impossible aim of using no adjectives at all. I thought that if you could find the exact term a qualifying epithet could be dispensed with. As I saw it in my mind's eye my book would have the appearance of an immensely long telegram in which for economy's sake you had left out every word that was not necessary to make the sense clear. I have not read it since I corrected the proofs and do not know how near I came to doing what I tried. My impression is that it is written at least more naturally than anything I had written before; but I am sure that it is often slipshod, and I daresay there are in it a good many mistakes in grammar.

    Since then I have written many other books; and though ceasing my methodical study of the old masters (for though the spirit is willing, the flesh is weak), I have continued with increasing assiduity to try to write better. I discovered my limitations, and it seemed to me that the only sensible thing was to aim at what excellence I could within them. I knew that I had no lyrical quality. I had a small vocabulary, and no efforts that I could make to enlarge it much availed me. I had little gift of metaphor; the original and striking simile seldom occurred to me. Poetic flights and the great imaginative sweep were beyond my powers. I could admire them in others as I could admire their far-fetched tropes and the unusual but suggestive language in which they clothed their thoughts, but my own invention never presented me with such embellishments; and I was tired of trying to do what did not come easily to me. On the other hand, I had an acute power of observation, and it seemed to me that I could see a great many things that other people missed. I could put down in clear terms what I saw. I had a logical sense, and if not great feeling for the richness and strangeness of words, at all events a lively appreciation of their sound. I knew that I should never write as well as I could wish, but I thought with pains I could arrive at writing as my natural defects allowed. On taking thought it seemed to me that I must aim at lucidity, simplicity, and euphony. I have put these three qualities in the order of the importance I assigned to them.

    As soon as an American teacher comes into direct contact with the French educational system, he marvels at the large place writing holds in the schools and their routine life. First, it matters not in what classroom a small boy may be seen, he is never without his general notebook, in which he records all assignments, all problems, all experiments, all quotations to be learned, all geographical and historical notes and maps, as well as many special exercises; and the language he employs in this work is carefully marked and graded by the teacher. In the second place, compositions are numerous. From the time the boy is regarded as mature enough to think consecutively, he prepares compositions at regular intervals. In some classes he writes two short exercises every three or five days. In the elementary primary schools, even up to the time the boy is thirteen or fourteen years old, the shorter themes once or twice a week seem to stand in great favor. These vary in length, usually, from a hundred and fifty to four hundred words—they are rather longer than the average American daily theme—and the less frequent, longer compositions range ordinarily from six hundred to fifteen hundred words. Then, in the upper grades, there are, in addition, many papers in history, civics, philosophy, and literature. So it may be seen that a boy is provided with much opportunity to write. It is, in fact, scarcely an exaggeration to say that he writes all the time. In any event, his practice is so continuous that he sooner or later comes to do the work in a perfectly normal frame of mind, just as he performs his other schoolday labors.

    The volume of required writing, however, is regarded as less important than its quality. If a boy thinks and writes poorly, he is looked upon as an unfortunate who deserves either pity or contempt. If, on the other hand, he is able to think and write skillfully, he is held in great honor by his teachers and his classmates. And this interest in ability to write is evident outside the recitation-room. Authors of books and articles discuss the perils of the pure mother tongue as seriously as if they were dealing with a question of ethics or of grave national policy. Parents, I found when I was securing compositions for the purposes of this book, are usually desirous of preserving the written work of their children. Moreover, when pupils distinguish themselves in examinations—which in France are always largely a matter of composition—they receive prizes and public mention very much as if they were the winners of athletic trophies. Now I would not have anyone make the hasty inference that intellectual contests are substituted for athletics. The French boy loves the open just as much as the American boy does, and outdoor sports are steadily taking a larger place in school life. But the ideal of writing well has been held up before the schoolboy so long, and with such seriousness, that he attaches more importance to ability of this kind than the average American boy could at present be led to comprehend.

- prompt: "When so much importance is everywhere attached to ability to write, it  \nis not surprising to find that in both the primary and secondary school  \nsystems the course in the mother tongue gives large place to systematic  \ntraining in composition. It is the conviction of the great body of teachers,  \nas well as the Ministry, that work in grammar, rhetoric, and literature is in  \nmost respects lost unless it contributes to the pupil's ability to give full,  \nintelligent expression to his thought. Moreover, theories of teaching, and all  \nthe proposed changes in the course of study, seem to be considered first in  \nrespect to their influence on this ability of the pupil. Expression is not the  \nsole end, but in all the lower schools it is the primary end. And, taking the  \nother point of view, the chief responsibility for the pupil's manner of expres-  \nsion rests upon the teacher of the mother tongue. As we shall see later, the  \nwriting that the boy does in history, geometry, and his other subjects is  \nmade to contribute its full share to his skill; yet upon the teacher of the  \nnative language rests the largest responsibility and the greatest burden of  \nlabor. He accepts his task as difficult, very expensive in time and energy,  \nbut extremely important. Without going into any examination of exceptional  \naims or of intricate personal devices, let us see what he attempts to accomplish  \nand how he pursues his way.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P.

    Two groups of exercises are everywhere regarded as essential preliminaries to work in original composition. Those in the first group are intended to enlarge and organize the pupil's vocabulary. Now, I am aware that when one stands apart and looks at exercises designed to improve the vocabulary, they are likely to appear very artificial and ineffective. And, in truth, they may be. In the hands of a poorly trained teacher, or one who lacks the all-important teaching instinct, it would be difficult to imagine an exercise that could be more dismally futile. But this possibility seems to be disregarded by French educators. They are ready to admit that the lessons may become valueless, or even harmful, when directed by a poor teacher—and what exercise may not?—but they do not spring to the conclusion that such lessons should for that reason be cast aside. They have taken the good teacher as the norm, and have given themselves earnestly to the task of obviating the dangers and developing the advantages of a kind of instruction which at its best appears to them to have unquestioned value.

    The theory upon which this instruction is based is not the individual opinion of the occasional teacher; it is accepted doctrine throughout the country. In the volume of Instructions issued by the Minister to teachers in the secondary school system, it is summarized as follows: "The preceding exercises [in grammar] help the pupil to understand his native language and to enrich his vocabulary; but for this latter purpose, one ought not to rely solely upon them or even upon conversation, dictations, reading, or the explication of texts. The pupil must learn words, though never apart from things; he must be able to seize their signification and the exact shade of their meaning; and he must become accustomed to finding the words quickly when he stands in need. Hence the value of exercises devoted especially to the study of the vocabulary."

    In the exercise designed to enlarge the vocabulary, it is held to be absolutely essential that the pupil relate the word unmistakably to the object or idea which it represents. Although it is much more difficult to have a word in mind without relating it to some idea than we generally suppose, the French teacher seems to take no risk. He guides the pupil to feel the uselessness of words unless they are symbols of something physically or mentally real. Secondly, the pupil is required to relate a new word to other words already in his working vocabulary, so that it will remain firmly fixed in his mind. The new word may be linked to a synonym that is known to the pupil, it may be contrasted with words already known to him, or it simply may be linked to a group of ideas that by circumstances are brought to his mind frequently; but in some manner he is led to associate it with words which he knows well. Thirdly, the word is put into normal contexts—sometimes before its meanings are explained—so that the pupil may develop a feeling for its idiomatic use. And finally, in the definition or explanation that a word or a group of words may require, the beginning is specific rather than general, concrete rather than abstract. In theory at least, a teacher would establish the meaning of sincere in a boy's mind before he discussed the abstract quality, sincerity. He would show the boy that many things are rich before he explained richness; or noble, before he explained nobility. Moreover, if a word has many definitions, the simplest one, the one most easily understood, the one that would most readily associate itself with the boy's stock of concrete ideas and images is explained before those that are predominantly abstract or figurative. It is taken for granted that if a word is to be of much value to a boy, it must represent an idea clearly established in his mind, and it must have its individual flavor.

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Vocabulary Acquisition Strategies\n\nBased on the passage''s emphasis on vocabulary development, design a step-by-step teaching method for introducing a new word to students. Your method must incorporate all four of the following techniques: linking the new word to a known synonym, contrasting it with related words, placing it in normal contexts, and using concrete definitions first.\n- **Step 1**: Choose a new word (e.g., "sophisticated") and identify a synonym that the student already knows.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast this word with a simpler, related term (e.g., "simple") to highlight differences.\n- **Step 3**: Present the word in a common sentence (e.g., "The artist''s sophisticated style impressed the critics").\n- **Step 4**: Define the word using a concrete example before an abstract one (e.g., "A sophisticated person is someone who knows many things and can talk about them well").\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must demonstrate a clear understanding of each technique and how they contribute to long-term retention.

    In the exercises designed primarily to sharpen feeling for words, one is sure to be impressed with the many means by which a word is brought into the pupil's life. He defines it, he finds examples of its accepted uses, he learns its original significance—its literal meaning when the word is predominantly figurative—he compares it with other words of similar meaning, and above all, he contrasts it with words that are essentially its opposite. It is scarcely too much to say that the basis of all word-teaching is contrast rather than likeness. If a given word is used chiefly as a noun, the teacher does not let the pupil form the notion that synonymous adjectives may be attached to it indiscriminately, but helps him to learn what adjectives are or may be used appropriately with it. If the word is an adjective or verb, he shows how it normally takes certain adverbs, and how others, as soon as they are brought into close relation with it, seem awkward and unidiomatic. In a similar manner he guides the pupil to see the distinctions that usage has established between nouns which in general meaning are the same. To take a very simple example, if the word stem appeared in a lesson, he would be extremely careful to bring out the difference between stem and stalk, stem and trunk, and stalk and trunk, so that the pupil would never fall into the error of using them as if they were convertible terms. Through numerous exercises of this kind the pupil is made to see that words do not have the same value, and that the choosing of them is not merely a question of finding approved dictionary definitions when occasion arises, but of possessing a word sense.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Word Teaching Principles**\n\nUsing the principles outlined in the text, explain how a teacher should approach teaching the word ''stem'' to ensure students understand its distinct meanings and proper usage.\n- **Step 1**: Define the word ''stem'' according to its literal meaning.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast it with synonyms such as ''stalk,'' ''trunk,'' and ''root'' based on the text''s emphasis on contrast in word teaching.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example of a sentence where ''stem'' is used appropriately and another where it would be incorrect, demonstrating the importance of context.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s principle that ''the basis of all word-teaching is contrast rather than likeness'' and demonstrate an understanding of how this applies to the word ''stem''.'

    Concerning the exercises in calling words to mind quickly, little need be said. Their character has already been suggested. They usually consist of rapid-fire questions about the word itself, its use, its likes and opposites, and of oral or written practice in composition on subjects likely to call words of a given class into use. I saw no turning of verse into prose, but I did see many exercises that required the pupils to turn one kind of prose into another. In most instances the teacher simply read a story or an essay to the class and then called upon pupils to repeat it in language of their own. After a little practice of this kind, a boy unconsciously adopts many words that he has well understood but has not made a part of his working vocabulary. He does not surrender his individuality, as he must do—momentarily, at least—in writing imitations, yet he is in a state of open-mindedness that encourages a definite impression of what he reads or hears read.

    The scope of the lessons in vocabulary is wide. By the time a boy has reached the age of twelve he not only has had practice in calling simple objects by their right names, but he has reached out into the world around him and made acquaintance with words belonging to a great variety of activities. He can speak intelligently about the professions, the occupations of workingmen, the farm, social life, political life; he can discuss the more familiar phenomena of the atmosphere, the physical qualities of his friends, their moral virtues and their moral faults; he can use accurately the words that spring from such relations as commerce, war, colonization, life in the city or the small village; and he can talk or write about such means of communication as railways, steamships, street-railways, and the telegraph and telephone. This ability he gains not by sporadic or blind plunging about, but by means of orderly, systematic study. The instruction is not overrigid or mechanical; one might visit classrooms for months without feeling that the instruction was organized in any large way. Yet it is the careful organization that makes the wide scope of the work possible. The simplicity is not that of isolated, individual effort, but of well-designed plan.

    The second of the preliminary exercises universally employed by the French teacher of the mother tongue is dictation. In America, dictation seems to have been put aside to make way for something new. French teachers, however, do not hesitate to use an old-fashioned method or device if they believe it is good. Instead, therefore, of dropping dictation from the programme of studies, they have emphasized it and developed it until it is now a very important and thoroughly established part of their educational procedure.
    It is based on the conviction that a child can acquire skill before he develops the power of profound or sustained thought. He has much practice, then, in writing the thoughts of others while he is yet too young to write his own. Teachers admit that dictation has its dangers, but since they regard these as incomparable to its possible value, they employ it, just as they employ exercises in vocabulary, with the confidence that though they are risking small dangers, they are following the direction of a larger common sense.

    French teachers usually dwell upon four or five specific values of dictation. It gives the pupil much practice in the handling of the sentence; it directs his attention to grammatical constructions; it helps him to learn to spell, to punctuate, and to capitalize; it enlarges his vocabulary and gives him practice in the use of words already known to him; and it fills his mind with good standards of speech. To these should be added one value that the thoughtful teacher must regard as greatest of all; namely, that dictation prevents the pupil from separating spoken language and writing. One of the objections almost invariably made by the young pupil to practice in original composition is that writing seems an artificial process quite unlike anything.

    He has ever before attempted. In making this objection, he is, of course,
    merely giving expression to the fact that language is naturally a matter of
    speech rather than writing, and the additional fact that he has not felt a
    close relation between what he says by word of mouth and what he writes
    on paper. If then, before he begins composition, and later while he is prac-
    ticing it in an elementary manner, he has drill in writing down what he
    hears, the relation between speech and writing is much less likely to be
    weakened. While he is listening carefully to his teacher's reading, catching
    the words in their natural thought groups, and putting them down one by
    one in his exercise-book, he is not only learning much about the mechanics
    of composition, but he is saving himself from the error of looking upon
    theme-writing as something far removed from normal existence.

    In giving dictations, the teacher exercises great care. After the very earliest
    classes, where the work must of necessity be simple, he does not give isolated
    or detached sentences, but instead, a complete, interesting paragraph. More-
    over, he always explains the paragraph fully before he asks the pupil to
    write it down. This precaution is regarded as so important that a teacher
    is prohibited from requiring a pupil to write down anything that is mean-
    ingless or vague. Again, he reads a paragraph that contains material suited
    to keep the pupil's attention. That is to say, the ideas and the words in
    which they are expressed must be just within the pupil's reach. And finally,
    the teacher guards against letting the exercise become monotonous. It is
    never long—usually it is a short, crisp paragraph—the corrections are made
    immediately while interest is warm, and the pupil is not asked to rewrite
    the dictation unless he has been exceedingly careless. The ten or fifteen min-
    utes are so full of pleasant activity that the time passes quickly, and the boy
    seems never to dream that he is doing something that might, under a
    thoughtless teacher, become a dreary, useless punishment.

    When we turn from the preliminary preparation for writing to the actual work of constructing original compositions, we find at the outset that the French teacher attaches unusual importance to the kind of material with which a pupil practices. It is possible to conceive of a time in the history of French education when the substance of a pupil's writing might have been sacrificed to the niceties of elegant expression; but certainly no such evil exists today. In truth, here in our own country, where we boast—sometimes to our misfortune—that "substance is the thing," we give much less attention to the finding and developing of theme material than does the average teacher in France. It is true that the French are not yet satisfied with what they have accomplished in giving material its deserved place in the teaching of composition. In spite of the progress they have made, they believe that much yet remains to be done. But this very state of mind indicates how much importance is attached to subject matter.

    Material receives much of the teacher's thought not only because in a given instance it has a large part in determining the boy's success in his writing, but also because the subject-matter about which a boy writes from month to month and from year to year may be made an extremely influential part of his education. Here again we may observe the results of the Frenchman's ability to see things in the large. Regardless of differences of opinion about questions of detail, teachers agree that theme material should have a threefold influence upon a pupil's life: it should cultivate (1) observation, (2) imagination, and (3) reflection or judgment.

    In daily practice, the French watchword is sincerity. Teachers and heads of schools feel that in the older days when the Classical languages dominated completely the teaching of the mother tongue, much of the material assigned was to some extent beyond the pupil's mental reach. Consequently there is today a loud cry and a strict guarding against the encouragement of any sort of intellectual hypocrisy. One may yet meet occasionally with a teacher who clings to the older method of giving his boys culture or finish, but he is so much alone and so thoroughly on the defensive that he seems to belong to another educational age. The teacher that one meets every day believes in making theme material vital by relating it to the pupil's life. Neither in the grade of the material nor in the type within the grade does he permit unnecessary temptation to falsehood or affectation. Thus it comes about that the very young boy does not attempt to write organized compositions at all; that his first efforts in original work require only direct observation or the memory of observation previously made; that the next in order require observation and imagination; and that only as he approaches the end of his course—that is to say, when he would be a senior in an American high school or a freshman in college—is the material he must write upon designed chiefly to encourage analysis or reflection. Of course, these lines of demarcation are not rigidly drawn. The young pupil is asked to reflect, and the oldest pupil is asked to observe and imagine; but the emphasis is first upon observation, then upon imagination, and finally upon reflection.

    In helping pupils toward the actual process of writing down what they have to say, the French teachers so generally follow one practice that it must be regarded as an essential part of their method of instruction. This is the working over of material in the classroom. Teachers seem to feel that their first duty is to arouse the boy's interest in his subject and to put his mind in motion. He is made to feel at the outset that he must not attempt to organize his material—much less to write—until he knows what the material

    Indeed, it is so. Hence much emphasis is placed upon what one teacher aptly called the imaginative part of composing. That is to say, the boy is encouraged to let his power of association run free for the purpose of collecting as many ideas or images as possible. His only aim is to reach the limits of his subject; nothing that promises to be of the least value is permitted to escape. After these miscellaneous ideas or images are jotted down or by some other means fixed in mind, the members of the class examine them more carefully. And here, it might be observed in passing, speech is brought into use as an aid to writing. The exercise does not partake in the least of the nature of a formal lesson in oral composition, but the members of the class must speak accurately and clearly. The teacher questions the pupils, the pupils question the teacher, and the pupils question one another. The purpose is not to provide the indolent with material that is ready to use, but to give everyone enough of a basis to enable him to do thinking of his own. In the lower grades, the exercise is frequently nothing more than questions and answers designed to reveal the accuracy with which observations have been made; but in the higher grades it assumes the character of an interesting round-table discussion.

    The usual method of criticizing themes is significant in at least two respects. In the first place, the teacher makes a very large part of his criticism orally in the presence of the entire class. The written criticism is not slighted. But the vigorous classroom discussion is regarded as the chief means of helping pupils to do better work.

    ing pupils how themes are faulty or weak or uninteresting, but point out
    clearly how they might be made better. Prevailing faults are dealt with,
    most certainly; but much more time is devoted to pointing out qualities
    that are good. Frequently, poor work is put alongside good work, so that
    the pupils may see more readily just how far the one is from the other.
    Sometimes the comparison is humiliating to one of the pupils, but the teacher
    seems to worry very little about that fact. He wants the comparison to have
    its full force. Neither does he group all the grades of the better pupils between
    go and 92 7/16. He does not deal harshly with the pupil who because of
    little ability cannot do well; but he does not try to conceal anyone's weak-
    ness. His purpose is to lead all the pupils of the class to do better the next
    time, and if one boy's fault will be of service to himself or his classmates
    in future work, the teacher's sensitiveness about "hurting some one's feelings"
    is not likely to stand in the way. He points out pitfalls, and he dwells upon
    the good qualities that individual themes possess. Then he is almost certain
    to follow a plan of rebuilding that is recommended in the Instructions for
    secondary teachers. In this he and the pupils bring together the good quali-
    ties of the themes that have been read, and the teacher's and the pupils' best
    notions of what a theme ought to be, and fuse them into a kind of ideal
    theme, so that every pupil may see how good the work would be if it were
    the result of the combined intelligence of the class. Thus no pupil is left
    with the crushing conviction that there is no direction in which he may im-
    prove himself.

    The attention, then, that the actual business of writing receives in the French
    schools is a matter not only of adequate instruction, but of full and definite
    practice under stimulating circumstances. Composition is held up as a very
    important part—in fact, the most important part—of the course in the mother
    tongue. Studies in vocabulary and practice in dictation are carried on con-
    stantly in the lower grades in order that the boy may express himself with-
    out hindrance when he is once old enough to have something of his own to
    say in organized compositions. The material assigned is regarded as a matter
    of great moment. It is intended to develop, in order, the powers of attention
    and observation, the imagination, and habits of reflection. This material,
    moreover, is almost invariably discussed in the classroom until the pupil
    is awakened and interested; and when he writes upon it, he must give the
    most thoughtful care to organization and general good form. In the criticism
    of themes, oral discussion holds a large place. Furthermore, the teacher makes
    his critical suggestions distinctly constructive; that is, he emphasizes the
    difference between poor work and good, and he leads the pupils to reflect
    upon the possibilities that the subject-matter possesses, rather than upon the
    magnitude of their own shortcomings. And finally, the training that pupils
    receive in the study of the mother tongue is re-enforced to no small degree
    by the work in other subjects.

    Exercises in Imitation

    COPYING PASSAGES

    The first exercise in imitation that we will recommend to the student con-
    sists of copying passages, word for word, from admired authors. This may
    strike the student as being a rather brainless exercise, but it can teach the
    student a great deal about the niceties of style. Earlier in this chapter, we
    pointed out a number of features one looks for when he makes a close study
    of style. These features will strike the student as he carefully transcribes
    the passage.

    If the student is to derive any benefit from this exercise, he must observe
    a few simple rules:

    1. He must not spend more than fifteen or twenty minutes copying at
    any one time. If he extends this exercise much beyond twenty minutes at any
    one sitting, his attention will begin to wander, and he will find himself merely
    copying words.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Training in French Education**\n\nGiven the passage''s emphasis on the importance of practice and composition in French schools, evaluate the claim that "Rhetorical training is only effective when it is closely tied to real-world communication."\n- **Step 1**: Analyze the passage''s argument about the role of composition in developing "powers of attention and observation, the imagination, and habits of reflection."\n- **Step 2**: Compare this to the author''s assertion that "the material assigned is regarded as a matter of great moment."\n- **Step 3**: Justify your evaluation with references to the passage''s discussion of "stimulating circumstances" and "full and definite practice."\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly address the effectiveness of rhetorical training in the context of real-world communication, using specific passages from the text.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Imitation in Rhetorical Practice**\n\nUsing the instructions for "COPYING PASSAGES" from the text, design a 10-step plan for a student to effectively practice imitation in rhetorical writing:\n- **Step 1**: Select an admired author and a passage to copy.\n- **Step 2**: Follow the rule of not copying for more than twenty minutes at a time.\n- **Step 3**: Identify specific stylistic features from the passage (e.g., diction, sentence structure) as described in the text.\n- **Step 4**: Reflect on how these features contribute to effective communication.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your plan must incorporate the "rules" provided in the text and explicitly reference the features discussed in the passage.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Analysis of Rhetorical Training Methods**\n\nCritically evaluate the passage''s assertion that "the training that pupils receive in the study of the mother tongue is re-enforced to no small degree by the work in other subjects."\n- **Step 1**: Analyze how the passage connects language training to other academic disciplines.\n- **Step 2**: Examine the role of "stimulating circumstances" and "constructive criticism" in reinforcing mother-tongue training.\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in developing comprehensive communication skills.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly address the interplay between language training and other subjects, using specific examples from the passage.\n'

    2. He must do this copying with a pencil or pen. Typing is so fast and so mechanical that the student can copy off whole passages without paying any attention to the features of an author's style. Copying by hand, he transcribes the passage at such a pace that he has time to observe the choice and disposition of words, the patterns of sentences, and the length and variety of sentences.

    3. He must not spend too much time with any one author. If the student concentrates on a single author's style, he may find himself falling into that "servile imitation" that rhetoricians warned of. The aim of this exercise is not to acquire someone else's style but to lay the groundwork for developing one's own style by getting the "feel" of a variety of styles.

    4. He must read the entire passage before starting to copy it so that he can capture the thought and the manner of the passage as a whole. When he is copying, it is advisable to read each sentence through before transcribing it. After the student has finished copying the passage, he should read his transcription so that he once again gets a sense of the passage as a whole.

    5. He must copy the passage slowly and accurately. If he is going to dash through this exercise, he might as well not do it at all. A mechanical way of insuring accuracy and the proper pace is to make his handwriting as legible as he can.

    The student will derive the maximum benefit from this copying exercise if he will practice it over an extended period of time. Transcribing a single different passage every day for a month will prove more beneficial to the student than transcribing several different passages every day for a week. The student must have time to absorb what he has been observing in this exercise; and he will not have time to absorb the many lessons to be learned from this exercise if he crams it into a short period.

    IMITATING SENTENCE PATTERNS

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Copying Techniques**\n\nA student is tasked with copying a passage from a text to improve their understanding of authorial style. Based on the instructions provided, outline a step-by-step process that the student should follow to effectively engage with this exercise.\n- **Step 1**: Describe how the student should approach reading the passage before copying it.\n- **Step 2**: Explain the importance of transcribing each sentence individually after reading it.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why copying the passage slowly and accurately is essential to developing a ''feel'' for different styles.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the key principles from the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of how each step contributes to mastering authorial style.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning on Imitation**\n\nThe text warns against copying the style of a single author and instead encourages exposure to multiple styles. Using logical reasoning, explain why imitating only one author''s style could lead to ''servile imitation'' and how exposure to varied styles aids in developing originality.\n- **Part A**: Define ''servile imitation'' as described in the text and explain its potential negative consequences.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of how exposure to multiple styles can help a student develop their own unique style.\n- **Part C**: Justify why the text recommends extending this practice over time rather than cramming it into a short period.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s argument and apply it to real-world reasoning about literary development.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Transcription**\n\nA student is copying a passage and must decide how to balance speed and accuracy. Based on the text''s advice, create a scenario where the student must choose between copying quickly (to complete the exercise) and copying slowly (to ensure accuracy).\n- **Part A**: Describe a situation where the student prioritizes speed over accuracy and explain the potential drawbacks.\n- **Part B**: Describe a situation where the student prioritizes accuracy over speed and explain the benefits of this approach.\n- **Part C**: Propose a compromise that balances both speed and accuracy, referencing the text''s advice on handwriting legibility.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your scenario must reflect the text''s emphasis on quality over quantity and demonstrate an application of its principles to real-life decision-making.'

    After the student has spent some time merely copying passages, he might
    attempt another kind of imitation. He can take individual sentences as pat-
    terns on which to devise sentences of his own. This is a more difficult exer-
    cise than the verbatim copying, but it pays high dividends to the student
    who uses it conscientiously.

    How closely should the student follow the model? As closely as he cares
    to, is the most sensible answer. But he will find this exercise most fruitful if
    he will observe at least the same kind, number, and order of clauses and
    phrases. If the model sentence has an adverb clause, he should write an
    adverb clause. If the model sentence is introduced by a participial phrase,
    he should put a participial phrase in the lead-off position. If the model sen-
    tence has three noun clauses arranged in parallel structure, he should write
    a sentence containing three noun clauses in a similar structure.

    The aim of this exercise is not to achieve a word-for-word correspondence
    with the model but rather to achieve an awareness of the variety of sentence
    structures of which the English language is capable. The reason why many
    students never venture outside their puerile, monotonous sentence structure
    is that they have never attempted sophisticated sentence patterns. Writiny:
    such patterns according to models will increase the student's syntactical re
    sources. And with more resources at his command, he will acquire more
    confidence in his writing ability.

    No one, of course, says to himself while he is writing, "I just wrote a com
    pound sentence interspersed with gerund phrases. This time I think PI begin
    my sentence with an adverb clause and use a series of noun clauses as thi
    object of the main verb." Such a self-conscious approach to writing would
    undoubtedly result in some monstrous prose.

    No, our prose must come as naturally as—to use Keats's words—‘"the leaves
    to the trees." The kind of prose we write cannot be arbitrary; it is governed
    by the subject matter, the occasion, the purpose, the audience, and the pet

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Sentence Structure Patterns**\n\nUsing the principles from the text, create a sentence that mimics the structure of this model sentence: *''The student who has spent some time merely copying passages may attempt another kind of imitation.''*\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key structural elements in the model sentence (e.g., adverb clause, main clause).\n- **Step 2**: Replicate the same number and order of clauses, ensuring parallelism in structure.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your constructed sentence by referencing the text''s emphasis on ''observing at least the same kind, number, and order of clauses.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your sentence must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s principles, with a clear explanation of how it reflects the model''s structure.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analyzing Writing Habits and Prose Quality**\n\nThe text suggests that students often use monotonous sentence structures because they have not attempted sophisticated patterns.\n- **Part A**: Explain why the author believes that exposing students to complex sentence structures through imitation improves their writing skills.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the author''s view on ''natural prose'' (as in Keats''s quote) with a self-conscious, deliberate approach to writing.\n- **Part C**: Construct an example of ''natural prose'' that demonstrates the author''s idea of writing being influenced by subject matter, purpose, and audience.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s concepts of imitation, sophistication in sentence structure, and the role of natural prose in effective writing.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Rhetorical Imitation**\n\nBased on the text''s discussion of sentence structure patterns, create a short paragraph that demonstrates the following:\n1. An adverb clause at the beginning of the sentence\n2. A participial phrase in the lead-off position\n3. Three noun clauses arranged in parallel structure as objects of a main verb\n- **Part A**: Write the paragraph, ensuring that each structural element is present and in the correct order.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how your paragraph reflects the text''s principles of imitation and syntactical resource development.\n- **Part C**: Explain how this exercise aligns with the text''s argument that ''prose must come as naturally as the leaves to the trees.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your paragraph and analysis must demonstrate mastery of the text''s rhetorical strategies for improving writing skills.'

    The sonality of the writer. If it is true that matter and form are intimately related, then there must be one best way in which to say a particular thing for a given audience and purpose. But as a practical matter, what we manage to achieve most of the time is one of a number of better ways to say something. Coleridge once said that the infallible test of a perfect style was "its untranslatableness in words of the same language without injury to the meaning." Only seldom, perhaps, do we achieve this kind of "inevitable prose." What we achieve most of the time is, at best, an adequate prose.

    A great deal of the writing the student may be called upon to do in the future will be impromptu, spur-of-the-moment writing. While he is still in school, he will have to write essay-type examinations, where he has little time for reflection and almost no time for revision. In his job someday, he will have to dash off memos, directives, and letters. As a private citizen, he will have to scribble off notes to send to school with his children, pen a hurried letter to his parents, pound out a letter to the editor of the local newspaper. The more practice he has had in writing, the better will be this one-draft prose.

    But he may also be called upon at times to do some writing that entails a great deal of reflection, research, organization, and revision. He may have to write a report to be read to the board of governors or prepare a speech to be delivered before the Chamber of Commerce. It is this kind of deliberate writing that will call upon all the inventive and stylistic resources at his command. This will necessarily be slow writing, but it does not have to be labored writing for being slow. Someone once said that "hard writing makes for easy reading." And Quintilian once said, "Write quickly and you will never write well; write well and you will soon write quickly."

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Rhetorical Principles\n\nUsing the text''s discussion on the relationship between matter and form, explain how a writer should balance ''infallible test of a perfect style'' with the practical need for ''adequate prose.''\n- **Step 1**: Define ''infallible test of a perfect style'' and ''adequate prose'' based on the text.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how the text suggests that perfect style is unattainable in most cases but ''adequate prose'' is the standard for practical writing.\n- **Step 3**: Construct an example of a situation where ''infallible'' style would be expected, and another where ''adequate prose'' is sufficient.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s philosophical stance on style and its practical implications in different writing contexts.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Practical Application of Rhetorical Writing\n\nGiven the text''s emphasis on impromptu writing, compose a one-draft letter to a friend explaining that you will be unable to attend a planned meeting.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the purpose, audience, and context of the letter based on the text''s discussion of ''spur-of-the-moment writing.''\n- **Step 2**: Apply the text''s advice on ''one-draft prose'' by writing the letter without revision.\n- **Step 3**: Justify your choice of language and structure based on the text''s assertion that ''the more practice he has had in writing, the better will be this one-draft prose.''\n**Answer Requirement**: The letter must demonstrate ''adequate prose'' as defined in the text and reflect the writer''s experience with impromptu writing.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Reflection on Deliberate Writing\n\nThe text contrasts ''slow writing'' with ''labored writing.'' Explain how a writer can achieve ''slow writing'' without it being ''labored,'' using examples from the text.\n- **Step 1**: Define ''slow writing'' and ''labored writing'' based on the text.\n- **Step 2**: Use the quote ''hard writing makes for easy reading'' to argue that deliberate, thoughtful writing leads to clarity.\n- **Step 3**: Provide an example of a deliberate writing task (e.g., preparing a speech) and explain how the writer can ensure it is ''slow but not labored.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate the text''s discussion on the relationship between writing quality and speed, as well as its advice on achieving effective deliberate writing.'

    So with these cautions and objectives in mind, let the student now try his
    hand at imitating the sentence patterns of practiced writers. The student may
    never in his life have occasion to write a sentence like some of those that
    he has mechanically imitated in this exercise, but he will be none the worse
    for having gone through the paces.

    As examples of how to imitate sentence patterns, a few samples of the
    method are printed below. For models, the student can select sentences from
    his favorite authors, or he can use sentences from the specimen passages
    reproduced in this chapter.

    SAMPLE IMITATIONS

    MobeL sENTENCE: The gallows stood in a small yard, separate from the main
    grounds of the prison and overgrown with tall prickly weeds—
    George Orwell, Burmese Days

    468 STYLE

    Imiration: The dog shivered in the background, wet from nosing his way
    through the early-morning grasses and covered with damp cockle-
    spurs.

    (Write a sentence according to the pattern of the model sentence.)

    Monet sENTENcE: He went through the narrow alley of Temple Bar quickly,
    muttering to himself that they could all go to hell because he was
    going to have a good night of it—James Joyce, "Counterparts"

    Imiration: They stood outside on the wet pavement of the terrace, pretend-
    ing that they had not heard us when we called to them from the
    library.

    MobEL sENTENCE: To regain the stage in its own character, not as a mere
    emulation of prose, poetry must find its own poetic way to the mas-
    tery the stage demands—the mastery of action. Archibald Mac-
    Leish, "The Poet as Playwright"

    Imitation: To discover our own natures, not the personalities imposed on us
    by others, we must honestly assess the values we cherish—in short,
    our "philosophy of life."

    Mopet sEnTeENcE: If one must worship a bully, it is better that he should be
    a policeman than a gangster—George Orwell, "Raffles and Miss
    Blandish"

    Imitation: Since he continued to be belligerent, it was plain that cajoling
    would prove more effective than scolding.

    Specimen Passages for Imitation

    THE BIBLE

    I returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the
    battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of
    understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance hap-
    peneth to them all. For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are
    taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the
    sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them. This
    wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me. There
    was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against
    it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it. Now there was found
    in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man
    remembered that same poor man. Then said I, Wisdom is better than
    strength: nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are
    not heard. The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of
    him that ruleth among fools. Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but
    one sinner destroyeth much good.

    By the Cross of Christ stood the holy Virgin Mother, upon whom old Simeon's prophesy was now verified. For now she felt a sword passing through her very soul; she stood without clamour and womanish noises, and, silent, and with a modest grief, deep as the waters of the abyss, but smooth as the face of a pool, full of love and patience and sorrow and hope. Now she was put to it to make use of all those excellent discourses her holy Son had used to build up her spirit and fortify it against this day. Now she felt the blessings and strengths of Faith, and she passed from the griefs of the Passion to the expectation of the Resurrection, and she rested in this death as in a sad remedy; for she knew it reconciled God with all the World. But her hope drew a veil before her sorrow, and though her grief was great enough to swallow her up, yet her love was greater and did swallow up her grief. But the sun also had a veil upon his face and taught us to draw a curtain before the passion, which would be the most artificial expression of its greatness, whilst by silence and wonder we confess it great, beyond our expression, or which is all one, great as the burden and baseness of our sins; and with this veil drawn before the face of Jesus let us suppose him at the gates of Paradise, calling with his last words in a loud voice to have them opened: That the King of glory might come in.

    By this it appears how necessary it is for any man that aspires to true Knowledge to examine the Definitions of former Authors; and either to correct them, where they are negligently set down; or to make them himself.

    For the errors of Definitions multiply themselves, as the reckoning proceeds; and lead men into absurdities, which at last they see, but cannot avoid, without reckoning anew from the beginning; in which lies the foundation of their errors. From whence it happens that they which trust to books do as they that cast up many little sums into a greater, without considering whether those little sums were rightly cast up or not; and at last finding the error visible, and not mistrusting their first grounds, know not which way to clear themselves; but spend time in fluttering over their books;

    as birds that entering by the chimney and finding themselves enclosed in a chamber flutter at the false light of a glass window, for want of wit to consider which way they came in. So that in the right Definition of Names lies the first use of Speech; which is the acquisition of Science; and in the wrong, or no Definitions, lies the first abuse, from which proceed all false and senseless Tenets; which make those men that take their instruction from the authority of books, and not from their own meditation, to be as much below the condition of ignorant men, as men endued with true Science are above it.

    For between true Science and erroneous doctrines, ignorance is in the middle. Natural sense and imagination are not subject to absurdity. Nature itself cannot err, and as men abound in copiousness of language, so they become more wise or more mad than ordinary.

    If the nearness of our last necessity brought a nearer conformity into it, there
    were a happiness in hoary hairs, and no calamity in half-senses. But the long
    habit of living indisposeth us for dying; when avarice makes us the sport of
    death, when even David grew politicly cruel, and Solomon could hardly be
    said to be the wisest of men. But many are too early old, and before the date
    of age. Adversity stretcheth our days, misery makes Alcmena's nights, and
    time hath no wings unto it. But the most tedious being is that which can
    unwish itself, content to be nothing, or never to have been, which was beyond
    the malcontent of Job, who cursed not the day of his life, but his nativity;
    content to have so far been, as to have a title to future being, although he had
    lived here but in an hidden state of life, and as it were an abortion.

    Now therefore I went on in sin with great greediness of mind, still grudging
    that I could not be so satisfied with it as I would. This did continue with me
    about a month or more; but one day, as I was standing at a neighbor's shop-
    window, and there cursing and swearing and playing the madman, after
    my wonted manner, there sat within the woman of the house, and heard me,
    who, though she was a very loose and ungodly wench, yet protested that I
    swore and cursed at that most fearful rate that she was made to tremble to
    hear me; and told me further that I was the ungodliest fellow for swearing
    that ever she heard in all her life; and that I, by thus doing, was able to
    spoil all the youth in the whole town, if they came but in my company.

    At this reproof I was silenced and put to secret shame, and that too, as
    thought, before the God of heaven; wherefore, while I stood there, and
    hanging down my head, I wished with all my heart that I might be a little
    child again, that my father might learn me to speak without this wicked
    way of swearing; for, thought I, I am so accustomed to it that it is in vain
    for me to think of a reformation, for I thought it could never be.

    But how it came to pass, I know not; I did from this time forward so
    leave my swearing that it was a great wonder to myself to observe it; and
    whereas before, I knew not how to speak unless I put an oath before and
    another behind, to make my words have authority, now I could, without it,
    speak better, and with more pleasantness, than ever I could before. All this
    while I knew not Jesus Christ, neither did I leave my sports and play.

    SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE

    I know very well that many, who pretend to be wise by the forms of being
    grave, are apt to despise both poetry and music as toys and trifles too light
    for the use or entertainment of serious men. But whoever find themselves
    wholly insensible to these charms would, I think, do well to keep their own
    counsel, for fear of reproaching their own temper, and bringing the good-
    ness of their natures, if not of their understandings, into question. It may
    be thought at least an ill sign, if not an ill constitution, since some of the
    Fathers went so far as to esteem the love of music a sign of predestination,
    as a thing divine, and reserved for the felicities of Heaven itself. While this
    world lasts, I doubt not but the pleasure and request of these two entertain-
    ments will do so too; and happy those that content themselves with these or
    any other so easy and so innocent, and do not trouble the world or other
    men, because they cannot be quiet themselves, though nobody hurts them.

    (From "Of Poetry," 1690.)

    JOHN DRYDEN

    "Tis a vanity common to all writers, to overvalue their own productions; and 'tis better for me to own this failing in myself, than the world to do it for me. For what other reason have I spent my life in so unprofitable a study? why am I grown old in seeking so barren a reward as fame? The same parts and application which have made me a poet might have raised me to any honours of the gown, which are often given to men of as little learning and less honesty than myself. No Government has ever been, or ever can be, wherein time-servers and blockheads will not be uppermost. The persons are only changed, but the same jugglings in State, the same hypocrisy in religion, the same self-interest and mismanagement, will remain for ever. Blood and money will be lavished in all ages, only for the preferment of new faces, with old consciences. There is too often a jaundice in the eyes of great men; they see not those whom they raise in the same colours with other men. All whom they affect look golden to them, when the gilding is only in their own distempered sight. These considerations have given me a kind of contempt for those who have risen by unworthy ways. I am not ashamed to be little, when I see them so infamously great; neither do I know why the name of poet should be dishonourable to me, if I am truly one, as I hope I am; for I will never do anything that shall dishonour it.

    I must confess myself to have been very much dejected just before this happened; for the prodigious number that were taken sick the week or two before, besides those that died, was such, and the lamentations were so great everywhere, that a man must have seemed to have acted even against his reason if he had so much as expected to escape; and as there was hardly a house but mine in all my neighbourhood but what was infected, so had it gone on it would not have been long that there would have been any more neighbours to be infected. Indeed it is hardly credible what dreadful havoc the last three weeks had made, for if I might believe the person whose calculations I always found very well grounded, there were not less than 30,000 people dead and near 100,000 fallen sick in the three weeks I speak of; for the number that sickened was surprising; indeed it was astonishing, and those whose courage upheld them all the time before, sank under it now.

    In the middle of their distress, when the condition of the City of London was so truly calamitous, just then it pleased God, as it were, by His immediate hand to disarm this enemy; the poison was taken out of the sting. It was wonderful; even the physicians themselves were surprised at it. Wherever they visited they found their patients better; either they had sweated kindly, or the tumors were broke, or the carbuncles went down, and the inflamations round them changed color, or the fever was gone, or the violent headache was assuaged, or some good symptom was in the case; so that in a few days everybody was recovering, whole families that were infected and down, that had ministers praying with them, and expected death every hour, were revived and healed, and none died at all out of them.

    Though large herds of deer do much harm to the neighbourhood, yet the
    injury to the morals of the people is of more moment than the loss of their
    crops. The temptation is irresistible; for most men are sportsmen by con-
    stitution: and there is such an inherent spirit for hunting in human nature,
    as scarce any inhibitions can restrain. Hence, towards the beginning of this
    century all this country was wild about deer-stealing. Unless he was a hunter,
    as they affected to call themselves, no young person was allowed to be pos-
    sessed of manhood or gallantry. The Waltham blacks at length committed
    such enormities that government was forced to interfere with that severe
    and sanguinary act called the black act, which now comprehends more fel-
    onies than any law that ever was framed before. And, therefore, a late bishop
    of Winchester, when urged to re-stock Walthamchase, refused, from a mo-
    tive worthy of a prelate, replying that "it had done mischief enough already."

    Our old race of deer-stealers are hardly extinct yet: it was but a little while
    ago that, over their ale, they used to recount the exploits of their youth; such
    as watching the pregnant hind to her lair and, when the calf was dropped,
    paring its feet with a penknife to the quick to prevent its escape, till it was
    large and fat enough to be killed; the shooting at one of their neighbours
    with a bullet in a turnip-field by moonshine, mistaking him for a deer; and
    the losing a dog in the following extraordinary manner:—Some fellows, sus-
    pecting that a calf new-fallen was deposited in a certain spot of thick fern,
    went, with a lurcher, to surprise it; when the parent-hind rushed out of the
    brake and, taking a vast spring with all her feet close together, pitched upon
    the neck of the dog and broke it short in two.

    The renewal, or perhaps the improvement, of my English life was embittered by the alteration of my own feelings. At the age of twenty-one I was, in my proper station of a youth, delivered from the yoke of education, and delighted with the comparative state of liberty and affluence. My filial obedience was natural and easy; and in the gay prospect of futurity, my ambition did not extend beyond the enjoyment of my books, my leisure, and my patrimonial estate, undisturbed by the cares of a family and the duties of a profession. But in the militia I was armed with power; in my travels, I was exempt from control; and as I approached, as I gradually passed, my thirtieth year, I began to feel the desire of being master in my own house. The most gentle authority will sometimes frown without reason, the most cheerful submission will sometimes murmur without cause; and such is the law of our imperfect nature that we must either command or obey; that our personal liberty is supported by the obsequiousness of our own dependents. While so many of my acquaintances were married or in parliament, or advancing with a rapid step in the various roads of honour and fortune, I stood alone, immovable and insignificant; for after the monthly meeting of 1770, I had even withdrawn myself from the militia, by the resignation of an empty and barren commission. My temper is not susceptible of envy, and the view of successful merit has always excited my warmest applause. The miseries of a vacant life were never known to a man whose hours were insufficient for the inexhaustible pleasures of study. But I lamented that at the proper age I had not embraced the lucrative pursuits of the law or of trade, the chances of civil office or India adventure, or even the fat slumbers of the church; and my repentance became more lively as the loss of time was more irretrievable.

    A man who has been for twenty years at work on such matter as is now
    before us and who comes complacently forward with a whole quarto of it,
    after all the admonitions he has received, cannot reasonably be expected to
    "change his hand or check his pride," upon the suggestion of far weightier
    monitors than we can pretend to be. Inveterate habit must now have given
    a kind of sanctity to the errors of early taste; and the very powers of which
    we lament the perversion, have probably become incapable of any other ap-
    plication. The very quantity, too, that he has written, and is at this moment
    working up for publication upon the old pattern, makes it almost hopeless
    to look for any change of it. All this is so much capital already sunk in the
    concern, which must be sacrificed if that be abandoned; and no man likes
    to give up for lost the time and talent and labour which he has embodied in
    any permanent production. We were not previously aware of these obstacles
    to Mr. Wordsworth's conversion; and, considering the peculiarities of his
    former writings merely as the result of certain wanton and capricious ex-
    periments on public taste and indulgence, conceived it to be our duty to dis-
    courage their repetition by all the means in our power. We now see clearly,
    however, how the case stands; and, making up our minds, though with the
    most sincere pain and reluctance, to consider him as finally lost to the good
    cause of poetry, shall endeavour to be thankful for the occasional gleams of
    tenderness and beauty which the natural force of his imagination and af-
    fections must still shed over all his productions, and to which we shall ever
    turn with delight, in spite of the affectation and mysticism and prolixity,
    with which they are so abundantly contrasted.

    I ground both the moral and intellectual importance of habituating our-
    selves to a strict accuracy of expression. It is noticeable how limited an ac-
    quaintance with the masterpieces of art will suffice to form a correct and even
    a sensitive taste, where none but masterpieces have been seen and admired:
    while, on the other hand, the most correct notions, and the widest acquaint-
    ance with the works of excellence of all ages and countries, will not per-
    fectly secure us against the contagious familiarity with the far more numer-
    ous offspring of tastelessness or of a perverted taste. If this be the case, as it
    notoriously is, with the arts of music and painting, much more difficult will
    it be to avoid the infection of multiplied and daily examples in the practice
    of an art which uses words, and words only, as its instruments. In poetry,
    in which every line, every phrase, may pass the ordeal of deliberation and
    deliberate choice, it is possible, and barely possible, to attain that ultimatum
    which I have ventured to propose as the infallible test of a blameless style—
    its wntranslatableness in words of the same language without injury to the
    meaning. Be it observed, however, that I include in the meaning of a word
    not only its correspondent object but likewise all the associations which it
    recalls. For language is framed to convey not the object alone, but likewise
    the character, mood, and intentions of the person who is representing it.

    The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region and seems
    to be commander-in-chief of all powers of the air, is the apparition of
    a figure on horseback without a head. It is said by some to be the ghost of
    a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball,
    in some nameless battle during the revolutionary war; and who is ever and
    anon seen by the country folk, hurrying along in the gloom of night, as if
    on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not confined to the valley, but
    extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a
    church at no great distance. Indeed, certain of the most authentic historians of
    those parts, who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts
    concerning this spectre, allege that the body of the trooper having been
    buried in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in
    nightly quest of his head; and that the rushing speed with which he some-
    times passes along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being
    belated and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.

    Any one may mouth out a passage with a theatrical cadence, or get upon
    stilts to tell his thoughts; but to write or speak with propriety and simplic-
    ity is a more difficult task. Thus it is easy to affect a pompous style, to use
    a word twice as big as the thing you want to express: it is not so easy to
    pitch upon the very word that exactly fits it. Out of eight or ten words
    equally common, equally intelligible, with nearly equal pretensions, it is
    a matter of some nicety and discrimination to pick out the very one, the
    preferableness of which is scarcely perceptible, but decisive. The reason why
    I object to Dr. Johnson's style is that there is no discrimination, no selection,
    no variety in it. He uses none but "tall, opaque words," taken from the

    "first row of the rubric'—words with the greatest number of syllables, or
    Latin phrases with merely English terminations. If a fine style depended
    on this sort of arbitrary pretension, it would be fair to judge of an author's
    elegance by the measurement of his words, and the substitution of foreign
    circumlocutions (with no precise associations) for the mother-tongue. How
    simple it is to be dignified without ease, to be pompous without meaning!
    Surely, it is but a mechanical rule for avoiding what is low to be always
    pedantic and affected. It is clear you cannot use a vulgar English word, if
    you never use a common English word at all. A fine tact is shewn in adher-
    ing to those which are perfectly common, and yet never falling into any
    expressions which are debased by disgusting circumstances, or which owe
    their significance and point to technical or professional allusions. A truly
    natural or familiar style can never be quaint or vulgar, for this reason, that
    it is of universal force and applicability, and that quaintness and vulgarity
    arise out of the immediate connection of certain words with coarse and
    disagreeable, or with confined, ideas.

    Let those who look upon style as unworthy of much attention ask themselves how many, in proportion to men of genius, have excelled in it. In all languages, ancient and modern, are there ten prose-writers at once harmonious, correct, and energetic? Harmony and correctness are not uncommon separately, and force is occasionally with each; but where, excepting in Milton, where, among all the moderns, is energy to be found always in the right place? Even Cicero is defective here, and sometimes in the most elaborate of his orations. In the time of Milton it was not customary for men of abilities to address to the people at large what might inflame their passions. The appeal was made to the serious, to the well-informed, to the learned, and was made in the language of their studies. The phraseology of our Bible, on which no subsequent age has improved, was thought to carry with it solemnity and authority; and even when popular feelings were to be aroused to popular interest, the language of the prophets was preferred to the language of the vulgar. Hence, amid the complicated antagonisms of war there was more austerity than ferocity. The gentlemen who attended the court avoided the speech as they avoided the manners of their adversaries. Waller, Cowley, and South were resolved to refine what was already pure gold, and inadvertently threw into the crucible many old family jewels deeply encased within it. Eliot, Pym, Selden, and Milton reverenced their father's house and retained its right language unmodified. Lord Brougham would make us believe that scarcely a sentence in Milton is easy, natural, and vernacular. Nevertheless, in all his dissertations, there are many which might appear to have been written in our days, if indeed any writer in our days were endowed with the same might and majesty.

    Here, too, may we not pause for an instant and make a practical reflection?
    Considering the multitude of mortals that handle the Pen in these days,
    and can mostly spell, and write without glaring violations of grammar, the
    question naturally arises: How is it, that no Work proceeds from them,
    bearing any stamp of authenticity and permanence; of worth for more than
    one day? Shiploads of Fashionable Novels, Sentimental Rhymes, Tragedies,
    Farces, Diaries of Travel, Tales by flood and field, are swallowed monthly
    into the bottomless Pool: still does the Press toil; innumerable Paper-makers,
    Compositors, Printers' Devils, Book-binders, and Hawkers grown hoarse
    with loud proclaiming, rest not from their labour; and still, in torrents,
    rushes on the great array of Publications, unpausing, to their final home;
    and still Oblivion, like the Grave, cries, Give! Give! How is it that of all
    these countless multitudes, no one can attain to the smallest mark of excel-
    lence, or produce aught that shall endure longer than "snowflake on the
    river," or the foam of penny-beer? We answer: Because they are foam;
    because there is no Reality in them. These Three Thousand men, women
    and children, that make up the army of British Authors, do not, if we will
    well consider it, see anything whatever; consequently they ave nothing that
    they can record and utter, only more or fewer things that they can plausibly
    pretend to record. The Universe, of Man and Nature, is still quite shut up
    from them; the "open secret" still utterly a secret; because no sympathy
    with Man or Nature, no love and free simplicity of heart has yet unfolded
    the same. Nothing but a pitiful Image of their own pitiful Self, with its
    vanities, and grudgings, and ravenous hunger of all kinds, hangs forever
    painted in the retina of these unfortunate persons; so that the starry ALL,
    with whatsoever it embraces, does but appear as some expanded magic-
    lantern shadow of that same Image—and naturally looks pitiful enough.

    I have paid no poll-tax for six years. I was put into a jail once on this account, for one night; and, as I stood considering the walls of solid stone,
    two or three feet thick, the door of wood and iron, a foot thick, and the
    iron grating which strained the light, I could not help being struck with
    the foolishness of that institution which treated me as if I were mere flesh
    and blood and bones, to be locked up. I wondered that it should have con-
    cluded at length that this was the best use it could put me to, and had
    never thought to avail itself of my services in some way. I saw that, if
    there was a wall of stone between me and my townsmen, there was a
    still more difficult one to climb or break through before they could get to
    be as free as I was. I did not for a moment feel confined, and the walls
    seemed a great waste of stone and mortar. I felt as if I alone of all my towns-
    men had paid my tax. They plainly did not know how to treat me, but
    behaved like persons who are underbred. In every threat and in every com-

    stand the other side of that stone wall. I could not but smile to see how
    industriously they locked the door on my meditations, which followed them
    out again without let or hindrance, and they were really all that was danger-

    The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled
    to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way
    of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the
    form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That prin-
    ciple is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually
    or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their num-
    ber, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be right-
    fully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will,
    is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is
    not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear
    because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier,
    because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise or even right.
    These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him,
    or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visit-
    ing him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct
    from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil
    to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is
    amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely
    concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over
    his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.

    (From On Liberty, 1859.)

    ABRAHAM LINCOLN

    Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent
    a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all
    men are created equal.

    Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or
    any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on
    a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that
    field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that
    nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Moral and Legal Compulsion in Society**\n\nUsing the passage from *On Liberty*, argue whether it is morally justifiable to compel an individual to act in the public interest (e.g., adhering to laws, social norms) when that action is not directly harmful to others.\n- **Step 1**: Reference the principle that ''the sole end for which mankind are warranted in interfering with liberty is self-protection.''\n- **Step 2**: Apply this principle to a hypothetical scenario where an individual chooses not to follow a law that is widely perceived as beneficial (e.g., vaccination requirements).\n- **Step 3**: Justify your position by distinguishing between ''moral coercion'' and ''physical force'' as discussed in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must explicitly tie the concept of self-protection to the ethical justification for or against compulsory action, using at least two distinct logical points from the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Ethical Justification for Exemption from Legal Compulsion**\n\nConsider the following scenario: A person refuses to serve in the military due to a deeply held moral belief (e.g., opposition to war). Using *On Liberty*, determine whether this person is justified in refusing to comply with a legal mandate.\n- **Step 1**: Cite the text''s assertion that ''his own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.''\n- **Step 2**: Analyze the ethical distinction between ''moral coercion'' and ''physical force'' in this context.\n- **Step 3**: Construct a counterargument for the opposing view that societal benefit justifies compulsory service.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s principles with a logical counterargument, demonstrating an understanding of the boundaries between moral persuasion and compulsion.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Freedom of the Individual vs. Collective Good**\n\nThe Gettysburg Address states that ''government of the people, by the people, for the people'' should ensure equality. How does this principle align or conflict with the idea of self-protection as outlined in *On Liberty*?\n- **Step 1**: Reference the Lincoln quote about ''a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.''\n- **Step 2**: Compare this ideal with the text''s assertion that ''the individual is sovereign over his own body and mind.''\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate whether the collective good (e.g., national unity, equality) can override individual liberty in a democratic society.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must explicitly connect the rhetoric of the Gettysburg Address to the philosophical principles of *On Liberty*, using logical reasoning to defend your position on the balance between individual freedom and communal responsibility.'

The brave men, living and dead, who struggled  \nhere, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The  \nworld will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can  \nnever forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather, to be dedi-  \ncated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus  \nfar so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great  \ntask remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased  \ndevotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion;  \nthat we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that  \nthis nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; and that govern-  \nment of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from  \nthe earth.\n\n(From The Gettysburg Address, 1863.)\n\nSPECIMEN PASSAGES FOR IMITATION 483\n\nJOHN RUSKIN\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical and Historical Context**\n\nAnalyze the rhetorical strategies used in the Gettysburg Address and compare them to the style of John Ruskin''s text.\n- **Part A**: Identify and explain two rhetorical devices in Lincoln''s speech (e.g., anaphora, parallelism) and their effect on the audience.\n- **Part B**: Contrast these devices with those found in Ruskin''s text, which is described as a ''classical'' rhetorical work.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how the historical context of the Gettysburg Address (the Civil War) influences the structure and tone of Lincoln''s speech compared to Ruskin''s more general philosophical writing.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both texts'' rhetorical techniques and their historical contexts, integrating the concepts from the given passages.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Analysis of Rhetorical Purpose**\n\nEvaluate the rhetorical purpose of Lincoln''s Gettysburg Address in light of its historical context.\n- **Part A**: Explain how Lincoln''s use of repetition (''Fourscore and seven years ago...'') serves to unify the audience and reinforce his central message.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the inclusion of ''government of the people, by the people, for the people'' reflects the values of the time and its significance in the context of the Civil War.\n- **Part C**: Compare this purpose to the philosophical inquiries in Ruskin''s text, which focuses on the relationship between art and society.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must connect Lincoln''s speech to its historical moment and contrast it with the more abstract concerns of Ruskin''s work.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Synthesis of Rhetorical Elements**\n\nCompose a short rhetorical passage (5-7 sentences) that combines elements from both the Gettysburg Address and Ruskin''s text.\n- **Part A**: Use anaphora (e.g., ''We hold...'') and parallel structure to mirror Lincoln''s speech.\n- **Part B**: Incorporate a philosophical reflection on the role of society, as seen in Ruskin''s text.\n- **Part C**: Ensure that your passage reflects the themes of dedication, purpose, and the enduring impact of human action.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your passage must demonstrate a clear synthesis of rhetorical techniques from both texts and convey the intended themes without direct reference to the provided passages.'

    And therefore, first of all, I tell you earnestly and authoritatively (I know
    I am right in this), you must get into the habit of looking intensely at
    words and assuring yourself of their meaning, syllable by syllable—nay,
    letter by letter. For though it is only by reason of the opposition of letters
    in the function of signs, to sounds in the function of signs, that the study of
    books is called "literature," and that a man versed in it is called, by the
    consent of nations, a man of letters instead of a man of books, or of words,
    you may yet connect with that accidental nomenclature this real fact: that
    you might read all the books in the British Museum (if you could live long
    enough) and remain an utterly "illiterate," uneducated person; but that if
    you read ten pages of a good book, letter by letter—that is to say, with real
    accuracy—you are for evermore in some measure an educated person. The
    entire difference between education and non-education (as regards the merely
    intellectual part of it) consists in this accuracy. A well-educated gentleman
    may not know many languages—may not be able to speak any but his own—
    may have read very few books. But whatever language he knows, he knows
    precisely; whatever word he pronounces, he pronounces rightly; above all,
    he is learned in the peerage of words; knows the words of true descent and
    ancient blood, at a glance, from words of modern canaille; remembers all
    their ancestry, their intermarriages, distant relationships, and the extent to
    which they were admitted, and offices they held, among the national noblesse
    of words at any time and in any country. But an uneducated person may
    know, by memory, many languages, and talk them all, and yet truly know
    not a word of any—not a word even of his own.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Literary Analysis and Rhetorical Reasoning**\n\nAnalyze the passage from *Of Kings'' Treasuries* by Walter Bagehot, focusing on the contrast between ''education'' and ''non-education'' as defined by the author.\n- **Step 1**: Identify two key characteristics of a ''well-educated gentleman'' as described in the passage.\n- **Step 2**: Contrast these with the traits of an ''uneducated person'' as outlined in the text.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how Bagehot''s argument reflects a broader rhetorical strategy of defining terms to establish authority in discourse.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must incorporate specific textual evidence and demonstrate an understanding of how the author''s definition of education shapes his rhetorical argument.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Reasoning and Logical Structure**\n\nExamine the passage''s structure and reasoning.\n- **Part A**: Determine the author''s logical progression from the assertion that one can read all books in the British Museum and still be ''illiterate'' to the conclusion that reading ten pages of a good book with attention leads to education.\n- **Part B**: Identify the rhetorical device used in the comparison between ''well-educated gentleman'' and ''uneducated person.'' Explain how this contrast serves to emphasize the author''s central thesis.\n- **Part C**: Apply Bagehot''s definition of education to a modern context. Provide an example where precise word usage and understanding of language (as described in the text) would be essential for effective communication or scholarship.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the passage''s structure and apply its principles to a contemporary scenario.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Interpretation of Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nThe passage discusses the importance of accurate word usage and linguistic precision.\n- **Part A**: Explain how Bagehot differentiates between ''knowing a language'' and ''knowing words.''\n- **Part B**: Interpret the metaphor of ''words of true descent and ancient blood'' in the context of language. How does this metaphor support Bagehot''s argument about the value of linguistic precision?\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterargument to Bagehot''s claim that ''education'' is solely defined by precise word usage. Use the text to support your counterargument, and propose an alternative definition that accounts for both linguistic accuracy and broader cultural understanding.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate textual evidence with critical reasoning to present a balanced analysis of Bagehot''s argument.

    History, it is said, is of no use; at least a great critic, who is understood to have in the press a very elaborate work in that kind, not long since seemed to allege that writings of this sort did not establish a theory of the universe, and were therefore of no avail. But whatever may be the use of this sort of composition in itself and abstractedly, it is certainly of great use relatively and to literary men. Consider the position of a man of that species. He sits beside a library-fire, with nice white paper, a good pen, a capital style, every means of saying everything, but nothing to say; of course he is an able man; of course he has an active intellect, beside wonderful culture; but still one cannot always have original ideas. Every day cannot be an era; a train of new speculation very often will not be found; and how dull it is to make it your business to write, to stay by yourself in a room to write, and then to have nothing to say! It is dreary work mending seven pens and waiting for a theory to "turn up." What a gain if something would happen! then one could describe it. Something has happened, and that something is history. On this account, since a sedate Greek discovered this plan for a grave immortality, a series of accomplished men have seldom been found wanting to derive a literary capital from their active and barbarous kindred. Perhaps when a Visigoth broke a head, he thought that that was all. Not so; he was making history; Gibbon has written it down.

    Once a day a cheap, gaudy packet arrived upward from St. Louis, and
    another downward from Keokuk. Before these events, the day was glorious
    with expectancy; after them, the day was a dead and empty thing. Not
    only the boys, but the whole village, felt this. After all these years I can
    picture that old time to myself now, just as it was then: the white town
    drowsing in the sunshine of a summer's morning; the streets empty, or
    pretty nearly so; one or two clerks sitting in front of the Water Street stores,
    with their splint-bottomed chairs tilted back against the walls, chins on
    breasts, hats slouched over their faces, asleep—with shingle-shavings enough
    around to show what broke them down; a sow and a litter of pigs loafing
    along the sidewalk, doing a good business in watermelon rinds and seeds;
    two or three lonely little freight piles scattered about the "levee"; a pile of
    "skids" on the slope of the stone-paved wharf, and the fragrant town drunk-

    the wharf, but nobody to listen to the peaceful lapping of the wavelets

    one of those remote "points"; instantly a negro drayman, famous for his quick
    eye and prodigious voice, lifts up the cry, "Steam-boat a-comin'!" and the
    scene changes! The town drunkard stirs, the clerks wake up, a furious clatter
    of drays follows, every house and store pours out a human contribution, and

    GEORGE BERNARD SHAW

    Among the friends to whom I have read this play in manuscript are some of
    our own sex who are shocked at the "unscrupulousness," meaning the utter
    disregard of masculine fastidiousness, with which the woman pursues her
    purpose. It does not occur to them that if women were as fastidious as men,
    morally or physically, there would be an end of the race. Is there anything
    meaner than to throw necessary work upon other people and then disparage
    it as unworthy and indelicate. We laugh at the haughty American nation
    because it makes the negro clean his boots and then proves the moral and
    physical inferiority of the negro by the fact that he is a shoeblack; but we
    ourselves throw the whole drudgery of creation on one sex, and then imply
    that no female of any womanliness or delicacy would initiate any effort
    in that direction. There are no limits to male hypocrisy in this matter. No
    doubt there are moments when man's sexual immunities are made acutely
    humiliating to him. When the terrible moment of birth arrives, its supreme
    importance and its superhuman effort and peril, in which the father has
    no part, dwarf him into the meanest insignificance: he slinks out of the
    way of the humblest petticoat, happy if he be poor enough to be pushed
    out of the house to outface his ignominy by drunken rejoicings. But when
    the crisis is over he takes his revenge, swaggering as the breadwinner, and
    speaking of Woman's "sphere" with condescension, even with chivalry, as
    if the kitchen and the nursery were less important than the office in the city.
    When his swagger is exhausted he drivels into erotic poetry or sentimental
    uxoriousness; and the Tennysonian King Arthur posing at Guinevere be-
    comes Don Quixote grovelling before Dulcinea.

    But as I sat scrawling these silly figures on the brown paper, it began to
    dawn on me, to my great disgust, that I had left one chalk, and that a most
    exquisite and essential chalk, behind. I searched all my pockets, but I could
    not find any white chalk. Now, those who are acquainted with all the
    philosophy (nay, religion) which is typified in the art of drawing on brown
    paper, know that white is positive and essential. I cannot avoid remarking
    here upon a moral significance. One of the wise and awful truths which
    this brown-paper art reveals is this, that white is a color. It is not a mere
    absence of color; it is a shining and affirmative thing, as fierce as red, as
    definite as black. When, so to speak, your pencil grows red-hot, it draws

  finalExamQuestion1: '**The Significance of White in Brown-Paper Art**\n\nIn the passage, Chesterton emphasizes that ''white is a color'' and describes it as ''shining and affirmative.'' How does this philosophical insight relate to the broader theme of the brown-paper art mentioned in the text?\n- **Step 1**: Identify the core philosophical idea presented about white.\n- **Step 2**: Connect this idea to the practical implications of using white in drawing on brown paper.\n- **Step 3**: Draw a parallel between this artistic practice and a philosophical truth about the nature of reality.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly address the symbolic and philosophical meaning of white in this context, demonstrating an understanding of Chesterton''s argument.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**The Moral Implication of Lost Chalk**\n\nChesterton''s anecdote about leaving behind a ''most exquisite and essential chalk'' serves as a metaphor for a deeper moral lesson. What is this lesson, and how does it reflect the broader philosophical stance of the text?\n- **Step 1**: Analyze the significance of the lost chalk in the context of the artist''s work.\n- **Step 2**: Connect this to a moral or ethical principle from the text.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how this metaphor illustrates a broader philosophical view of creativity and responsibility.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate both the anecdote and the philosophical implications, showing a clear understanding of Chesterton''s message.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**The Affirmative Nature of White**\n\nChesterton argues that white is ''a shining and affirmative thing'' and contrasts it with the mere absence of color. How does this perspective challenge common perceptions of white, and what does it reveal about the nature of truth or reality according to the text?\n- **Step 1**: Contrast white with the common perception of white as an absence of color.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how this contrast relates to the text''s philosophical stance on truth and reality.\n- **Step 3**: Draw a conclusion about the role of affirming concepts in understanding the world.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an ability to synthesize Chesterton''s philosophical ideas with the artistic and moral themes presented in the text.'

    roses; when it grows white-hot, it draws stars. And one of the two or three
    defiant verities of the best religious morality, of real Christianity, for example,
    is exactly this same thing; the chief assertion of religious morality is that
    white is a color. Virtue is not the absence of vices or the avoidance of moral
    dangers; virtue is a vivid and separate thing, like pain or a particular smell.
    Mercy does not mean not being cruel or sparing people revenge or punish-
    ment; it means a plain and positive thing like the sun, which one has
    either seen or not seen. Chastity does not mean abstention from sexual wrong;
    it means something flaming, like Joan of Arc. In a word, God paints in
    many colors; but He never paints so gorgeously, I had almost said so gaudily,
    as when He paints in white. In a sense our age has realized this fact, and
    expressed it in our sullen costume. For if it were really true that white
    was a blank and colorless thing, negative and noncommittal, then white
    would be used instead of black and gray for the funeral dress of this pessi-
    mistic period. We should see city gentlemen in frock coats of spotless silver
    linen, with top hats as white as wonderful arum lilies. Which is not the case.

    The house of fiction has in short not one window, but a million—a number
    of possible windows not to be reckoned, rather; every one of which has
    been pierced, or is still pierceable, in its vast front, by the need of the indi-
    vidual vision and by the pressure of the individual will. These apertures,
    of dissimilar shape and size, hang so, all together, over the human scene
    that we might have expected of them a greater sameness of report than
    we find. They are but windows at the best, mere holes in a dead wall, dis-
    connected, perched aloft; they are not hinged doors opening straight upon
    life. But they have this mark of their own that at each of them stands a
    figure with a pair of eyes, or at least with a field-glass, which forms, again
    and again, for observation, a unique instrument, insuring to the person
    making use of it an impression distinct from every other. He and his
    neighbours are watching the same show, but one seeing more where the
    other sees less, one seeing black where the other sees white, one seeing bi
    where the other sees small, one seeing coarse where the other sees fine. And
    so on, and so on; there is fortunately no saying on what, for the particular
    pair of eyes, the window may not open; "fortunately" by reason, precisely,
    of this incalculability of range. The spreading field, the human scene, is the
    "choice of subject"; the pierced aperture, either broad or balconied or slit-
    like and low-browed, is the "literary form"; but they are, singly or together,
    as nothing without the posted presence of the watcher—without, in other
    words, the consciousness of the artist. Tell me what the artist is, and I will
    tell you of what he has been conscious. Thereby I shall express to you at once
    his boundless freedom and his "moral" reference.

    Not to mention behind, and as he wedged himself this way and that in the crystalline entrance and bruised his well-fed flanks, he saw beneath him a comparatively slim camel passing through the eye of a needle and being woven into the robe of God. The Gospels all through couple stoutness and slowness. They point out what is perfectly obvious, yet seldom realized: that if you have a lot of things you cannot move about a lot, that furniture requires dusting, dusters require servants, servants require insurance stamps, and the whole tangle of them makes you think twice before you accept an invitation to dinner or go for a bathe in the Jordan. Sometimes the Gospels proceed further and say with Tolstoy that property is sinful; they approach the difficult ground of asceticism here, where I cannot follow them. But as to the immediate effects of property on people, they just show straightforward logic. It produces men of weight. Men of weight cannot, by definition, move like the lightning from the East unto the West, and the ascent of a fourteen-stone bishop into a pulpit is thus the exact antithesis of the coming of the Son of Man. My wood makes me feel heavy.

    We have our very individuality in relationship. Let us swallow this important and prickly fact. Apart from our connections with other people, we are barely individuals, we amount, all of us, to next to nothing. It is in the living touch between us and other people, other lives, other phenomena that we move and have our being. Strip us of our human contacts and of our contact with the living earth and the sun, and we are almost bladders of emptiness. Our individuality means nothing. A skylark that was alone on an island would be songless and meaningless, his individuality gone, running about like a mouse in the grass. But if there were one female with him, it would lift him singing into the air, and restore him his real individuity.

    This time the bear didn't strike him down. It caught the dog in both arms,
    almost loverlike, and they both went down. He was off the mule now. He
    drew back both hammers of the gun but he could see nothing but moiling
    spotted houndbodies until the bear surged up again. Boon was yelling
    something, he could not tell what; he could see Lion still clinging to the
    bear's throat and he saw the bear, half erect, strike one of the hounds with
    one paw and hurl it five or six feet and then, rising and rising as though
    it would never stop, stand erect again and begin to rake at Lion's belly with
    its forepaws. Then Boon was running. The boy saw the gleam of the blade
    in his hand and watched him leap among the hounds, hurdling them,
    kicking them aside as he ran, and fling himself astride the bear as he had
    hurled himself onto the mule, his legs locked around the bear's belly, his
    left arm under the bear's throat where Lion clung, and the glint of the
    knife as it rose and fell.

    It fell just once. For an instant they almost resembled a piece of statuary:
    the clinging dog, the bear, the man astride its back, working and probing
    490 STYLE

    the buried blade. Then they went down, pulled over backward by Boon's
    weight, Boon underneath. It was the bear's back which reappeared first
    but at once Boon was astride it again. He had never released the knife and
    again the boy saw the almost infinitesimal movement of his arm and
    shoulder as he probed and sought; then the bear surged erect, raising with
    it the man and the dog too, and turned and still carrying the man and the
    dog it took two or three steps toward the woods on its hind feet as a man
    would have walked and crashed down. It didn't collapse, crumple. It fell
    all of a piece, as a tree falls, so that all three of them, man dog and bear,
    seemed to bounce once.

    JAMES BALDWIN

    Negroes want to be treated like men: a perfectly straightforward statement, containing only seven words. People who have mastered Kant, Hegel, Shakespeare, Marx, Freud, and the Bible find this statement utterly impenetrable. The idea seems to threaten profound, barely conscious assumptions. A kind of panic paralyzes their features, as though they found themselves trapped on the edge of a steep place. I once tried to describe to a very well-known American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South. My recital disturbed him and made him indignant; and he asked me in perfect innocence, "Why don't all the Negroes in the South move North?" I tried to explain what happens, unfailingly, whenever a significant body of Negroes move North. They do not escape Jim Crow: they merely encounter another, not-less-deadly variety. They do not move to Chicago, they move to the South Side; they do not move to New York, they move to Harlem. The pressure within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand, and this expansion is always violent. White people hold the line as long as they can, and in as many ways as they can, from verbal intimidation to physical violence. But inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from the rest of the world falls back bitterly before the black horde; the landlords make a tidy profit by raising the rent, chopping up the rooms, and all but dispensing with the upkeep; and what has once been a neighborhood turns into a "turf." This is precisely what happened: when the Puerto Ricans arrived in their thousands—and the bitterness thus caused is, as I write, being fought out all up and down those streets.

    But the experience of the war itself as well as the mechanical age—and, as
    Allan Nevins has shown, the conduct of the war gave great stimulus to
    an increase of Northern efficiency—had its influence on American style.
    Grant and Lincoln, in writing and speaking, were distinguished by similar
    qualities: lucidity, precision, terseness. What was it they had in common that
    gave them the same traits of style? Lincoln was not a West Pointer; he had
    not been affected by military discipline. Nor was it that both came from
    the West and had the habit of homely speech. The humor of the West was
    drawling: its drawl was exploited by Mark Twain in his readings and no
    doubt in the same way by Lincoln when he was telling his funny stories;
    and Western eloquence was slow and expansive. But Grant and Lincoln
    were both quick thinkers: no drawl is to be heard in their writings or in
    the framing of their reported opinions. Even when Lincoln is debating
    Douglas, there is nothing of the spellbinder about him. Though it would
    seem that he does attempt sometimes, as Douglas accused him of doing,
    to temper his sentiments to his audience—as he passes, in Illinois, from the
    North to the South—he avoids the demagogic tricks that make up so much
    of Douglas's armory; he aims to be direct and cogent, to try to hit the nails
    on the head. What was it, then, that led Grant and Lincoln to express
    themselves with equal concision? It was undoudbtedly the decisiveness with
    which they had to speak. They had no time in which to waste words. To
    temporize or deceive was too dangerous. They are obliged to issue orders
    and to lay down lines of policy that will immediately be understood. Their
    role is to convince and direct. This is the language of responsibility, and its
    accent of decisiveness will be carried on by the younger men who have
    served in the war: by Ambrose Bierce in his stoical nightmare; by John De
    Forest in his Roman impassivity; by Justice Holmes in his judicial austerity.
    One finds this even in Cable when, emerging from the humid bayous and
    the rich dialects of Louisiana, he comes to present in unequivocal language
    his analysis of the problems of the South.

    In 1759, Dr. Hugh Blair began teaching rhetoric at the University of Edinburgh, and in 1762, he was appointed the first Regius Professor of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at Edinburgh. In 1783, upon his retirement from this post, Blair published the forty-seven lectures on rhetoric and literature that he had presented for twenty-four years to packed classrooms. This text, Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres, became a widely used book in the English and American schools in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century.

    Midway in the course of lectures Blair presented detailed stylistic analyses of four of Addison's Spectator essays (Nos. 411-14) and an analysis of Jonathan Swift's "A Proposal for Correcting, Improving, and Ascertaining the English Tongue." These analyses represent one of the few instances in English of a stylistic analysis of an entire essay.

    Blair comments on points of grammar, usage, and style in Addison's essays. From the reprinting of Blair's first analysis, the student will learn one technique of analyzing, pointedly and concretely, English prose sentences and may become more conscious of his own prose style. Some of Blair's strictures on Addison's style, such as his views on the relative pronouns which and that, are delivered from the standpoint of eighteenth-century usage. And while some of Blair's comments may strike a modern audience as being somewhat captious, most students will find Blair's criticism judicious. In almost every case where Blair has rewritten Addison's sentences, the student will remark an improvement in the neatness and clarity of the prose.

    Occasionally, Blair's style of punctuation has been silently changed.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Critical Analysis of Rhetorical Techniques in Addison''s Essay**\n\nIn the text, Blair provides a detailed analysis of Addison''s essay No. 411 in *The Spectator*. Using the principles of classical rhetoric outlined in the text, identify and explain three rhetorical devices used by Addison in this essay. For each device, provide an example from the text and explain how it contributes to the overall effectiveness of the essay.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of classical rhetorical devices and their application in the text. You must reference specific examples from Blair''s analysis to support your points.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Comparison of Rhetorical Structures**\n\nBlair''s analysis includes a comparison between Addison''s style and the standards of eighteenth-century usage. Consider the following two sentences from Blair''s text:\n1. "In this sentence, the relative pronoun ''which'' is used to refer to a preceding noun."\n2. "In this sentence, the relative pronoun ''that'' is used to refer to a preceding noun."\n\nUsing the principles of rhetoric discussed in the text, explain how the choice between ''which'' and ''that'' affects the clarity and style of the sentence. Provide an example from Blair''s analysis where this distinction is critical to understanding the essay''s meaning.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate an understanding of eighteenth-century usage standards and the specific impact of pronoun choice on rhetorical effectiveness.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Principles**\n\nBlair''s text provides insights into the analysis of English prose, including the importance of clarity and precision in writing. Construct a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) that demonstrates an application of these principles to your own writing. In your paragraph, explicitly state one rhetorical device you have used and explain how it enhances the clarity or effectiveness of your message.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must reflect an understanding of the principles outlined in Blair''s analysis and demonstrate a clear application to your own writing style.'

    I have insisted fully on the subject of language and style, both because it is, in itself, of great importance and because it is more capable of being ascertained by precise rule, than several other parts of composition. A critical analysis of the style of some good author will tend further to illustrate the subject, as it will suggest observations which I have not had occasion to make and will show, in the most practical light, the use of those which I have made.

    Mr. Addison is the author whom I have chosen for this purpose. The Spectator, of which his papers are the chief ornament, is a book which is in the hands of every one and which cannot be praised too highly. The good sense and good writing, the useful morality and the admirable vein of humour which abound in it, render it one of those standard books which have done the greatest honour to the English nation. I have formerly given the general character of Mr. Addison's style and manner as natural and unaffected, easy and polite, and full of those graces which a flowery imagination diffuses over writing. At the same time, though one of the most beautiful writers in the language, he is not the most correct; a circumstance which renders his composition the more proper to be the subject of our

    Present criticism. The free and flowing manner of this amiable writer sometimes led him into inaccuracies which the more studied circumspection and care of far inferior writers have taught them to avoid. Remarking his beauties, therefore, which I shall have frequent occasion to do, as I proceed, I must also point out his negligences and defects. Without a free, impartial discussion, of both the faults and beauties which occur in his composition, it is evident this piece of criticism would be of no service; and from the freedom which I use in criticising Mr. Addison's style, none can imagine that I mean to depreciate his writings, after having repeatedly declared the high opinion which I entertain of them. The beauties of this author are so many and the general character of his style is so elegant and estimable that the minute imperfections I shall have occasion to point out are but like those spots in the sun, which may be discovered by the assistance of art but which have no effect in obscuring its lustre. It is, indeed, my judgment that what Quintilian applies to Cicero, "Tile se profecisse sciat, cui Cicero valde placebit," may, with justice, be applied to Mr. Addison: that to be highly pleased with his manner of writing is the criterion of one's having acquired a good taste in English style. The paper on which we are now to enter is No. 411, the first of his celebrated Essays on the Pleasures of the Imagination in the sixth volume of The Spectator. It begins thus:

    (1) Our sight is the most perfect and most delightful of all our senses.

    This is an excellent introductory sentence. It is clear, precise, and simple. The author lays down, in a few plain words, the proposition which he is going to illustrate throughout the rest of the paragraph. In this manner, we should always set out. A first sentence should seldom be a long, and never an intricate, one.

    He might have said, "Our sight is the most perfect and the most delightful." But he has judged better in omitting to repeat the article the. For the repetition of it is proper, chiefly when we intend to point out the objects of which we speak, as distinguished from, or contrasted with, each other; and when we want that the reader's attention should rest on that distinction.
    For instance, had Mr. Addison intended to say that our sight is at once the most delightful and the most useful of all our senses, the article might then have been repeated with propriety, as a clear and strong distinction would have been conveyed. But as between perfect and delightful there is less contrast, there was no occasion for such repetition. It would have had no other effect but to add a word unnecessarily to the sentence. He proceeds:

    (2) It fills the mind with the largest variety of ideas, converses with its objects at the greatest distance, and continues the longest in action, without being tired or satiated with its proper enjoyments.
    494 STYLE

    This sentence deserves attention, as remarkably harmonious and well
    constructed. It possesses, indeed, almost all the properties of a perfect sen-
    tence. It is entirely perspicuous. It is loaded with no superfluous or unneces-
    sary words. For tired or satiated towards the end of the sentence are not
    used for synonymous terms. They convey distinct ideas and refer to differ-
    ent members of the period: that this sense continues the longest in action
    without being tired, that is, without being fatigued with its action; and
    also, without being satiated with its proper enjoyments. That quality of a
    good sentence which I termed its unity is here perfectly preserved. It is our
    sight of which he speaks. This is the object carried through the sentence
    and presented to us, in every member of it, by those verbs, fills, converses,
    continues, to each of which it is clearly the nominative. Those capital words
    are disposed of in the most proper places; and that uniformity is maintained
    in the construction of the sentence which suits the unity of the object.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Devices in Text Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the passage from *Classical Rhetoric for the Modern Student* to explain why the author considers the sentence: \"It fills the mind with the largest variety of ideas, converses with its objects at the greatest distance, and continues the longest in action, without being tired or satiated with its proper enjoyments.\" as a "perfect sentence." \n- **Step 1**: Identify three rhetorical elements in the sentence that contribute to its harmony and clarity. \n- **Step 2**: Explain how the use of repetition (or lack thereof) affects the reader''s understanding. \n- **Step 3**: Justify why the author emphasizes "unity" in a good sentence, referencing specific examples from the text. \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate textual evidence and demonstrate understanding of classical rhetorical principles without referring to external sources.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Principle: Unity and Distinction**\n\nThe text discusses the importance of repetition in distinguishing objects when contrast is intended. Using this principle, analyze the following sentence: \"Our sight is the most perfect and the most delightful.\" \n- **Part A**: Explain why repetition of ''the most'' is appropriate in this context. \n- **Part B**: Contrast this with the sentence: \"It fills the mind... without being tired or satiated...\" and explain how the absence of repetition serves a different rhetorical purpose. \n- **Part C**: Construct an original sentence that effectively uses repetition to highlight a contrast between two attributes. \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of how repetition and its absence function in rhetoric, supported by examples from the text.

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Rhetorical Unity**\n\nThe text emphasizes that a good sentence must maintain "unity" by consistently referring to the same object throughout. Using this principle, evaluate the following two sentences: \nSentence A: \"Our sight is the most perfect and the most delightful. It fills the mind...\" \nSentence B: \"Our sight is the most perfect. It fills the mind...\" \n- **Part A**: Explain why Sentence A is considered more unified than Sentence B, referencing the text''s explanation of "unity." \n- **Part B**: Propose a third sentence that would maintain unity while introducing a new attribute of sight. \n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the concept of unity in rhetoric applies to modern writing, using an example not from the text. \n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concept of rhetorical unity with logical reasoning and provide original examples based on the text''s principles.'

    Observe, too, the music of the period; consisting of three members, each
    of which, agreeable to a rule I formerly mentioned, grows and rises above
    the other in sound, till the sentence is conducted, at last, to one of the most
    melodious closes which our language admits—without being tired or satiated
    with its proper enjoyments. Enjoyments is a word of length and dignity,
    exceedingly proper for a close which is designed to be a musical one. The
    harmony is the more happy, as this disposition of the members of the period
    which suits the sound so well is no less just and proper with respect to the
    sense. It follows the order of nature. First, we have the variety of objects
    mentioned, which sight furnishes to the mind; next, we have the action of
    sight on those objects; and lastly, we have the time and continuance of its
    action. No order could be more natural and happy.

    This sentence has still another beauty. It is figurative, without being too
    much so for the subject. A metaphor runs through it. The sense of sight
    is, in some degree, personified. We are told of its conversing with its objects;
    and of its not being tired or satiated with its enjoyments; all which expres-
    sions are plain allusions to the actions and feelings of men. This is that
    slight sort of personification which, without any appearance of boldness and
    without elevating the fancy much above its ordinary state, renders discourse
    picturesque and leads us to conceive the author's meaning more distinctly,
    by clothing abstract ideas, in some degree, with sensible colours. Mr. Addison
    abounds with this beauty of style beyond most authors; and the sentence
    which we have been considering is very expressive of his manner of writing.
    There is no blemish in it whatever, unless that a strict critic might perhaps
    object that the epithet large, which he applies to variety—the largest variety
    of ideas—is an epithet more commonly applied to extent than to number.

    (3) The sense of feeling can, indeed, give us a notion of extension, shape, and all other ideas that enter at the eye, except colours; but, at the same time, it is very much straitened and confined in its operations to the number, bulk, and distance of its particular objects.

    This sentence is by no means so happy as the former. It is, indeed, neither clear nor elegant. Extension and shape can, with no propriety, be called ideas; they are properties of matter. Neither is it accurate, even according to Mr. Locke's philosophy (with which our author seems here to have puzzled himself), to speak of any sense giving us a notion of ideas; our senses give us the ideas themselves. The meaning would have been much more clear if the author had expressed himself thus: "The sense of feeling can, indeed, give us the idea of extension, figure, and all the other properties of matter which are perceived by the eye, except colours."

    The latter part of the sentence is still more embarrassed. For what meaning can we make of the sense of feeling being confined in its operation to the number, bulk, and distance, of its particular objects? Surely, every sense is confined, as much as the sense of feeling, to the number, bulk, and distance of its own objects. Sight and feeling are, in this respect, perfectly on a level; neither of them can extend beyond its own objects. The turn of expression is so inaccurate here that one would be apt to suspect two words to have been omitted in the printing, which were originally in Mr. Addison's manuscript, because the insertion of them would render the sense much more intelligible and clear. These two words are with regard—it is very much straitened and confined in its operations, with regard to the number, bulk, and distance of its particular objects. The meaning then would be that feeling is more limited than sight in this respect—that it is confined to a narrower circle, to a smaller number of objects.

    The epithet particular, applied to objects, in the conclusion of the sentence,
    is redundant and conveys no meaning whatever. Mr. Addison seems to
    have used it in place of peculiar, as indeed he does often in other passages
    of his writings. But particular and peculiar, though they are too often con-
    founded, are words of different import from each other. Particular stands
    opposed to general; peculiar stands opposed to what is possessed in common
    with others. Particular expresses what, in the logical style, is called species;
    peculiar, what is called differentia. Its peculiar objects would have signified,
    in this place, the objects of the sense of feeling, as distinguished from the
    objects of any other sense and would have had more meaning than zts

    particular objects, though, in truth, neither the one nor the other epithet
    was requisite. It was sufficient to have said simply, its objects.

    (4) Our sight seems designed to supply all these defects, and may be
    considered as a more delicate and diffusive kind of touch, that spreads
    itself over an infinite multitude of bodies, comprehends the largest fig-
    ures, and brings into our reach some of the most remote parts of the
    universe.

    Here again the author's style returns upon us in all its beauty. This is a
    sentence distinct, graceful, well arranged, and highly musical. In the latter
    part of it, it is constructed with three members, which are formed much
    in the same manner with those of the second sentence, on which I bestowed
    so much praise. The construction is so similar that if it had followed imme-
    diately after it, we should have been sensible of a faulty monotony. But the
    interposition of another sentence between them prevents this effect.

    (5) It is this sense which furnishes the imagination with its ideas; so
    that by the pleasures of the imagination or fancy (which I shall use
    promiscuously) I here mean such as arise from visible objects, either
    when we have them actually in our view or when we call up their ideas
    into our minds by paintings, statues, descriptions, or any the like occasion.

    In place of, It is this sense which furnishes, the author might have said more shortly, Tazs sense furnishes. But the mode of expression which he has used is here more proper. This sort of full and ample assertion, it is this which, is fit to be used when a proposition of importance is laid down to which we seek to call the reader's attention. It is like pointing with the hand at the object of which we speak. The parenthesis in the middle of the sentence, which I shall use promiscuously, is not clear. He ought to have said, terms which I shall use promiscuously; as the verb use relates not to the pleasures of the imagination but to the terms of fancy and imagination, which he was to employ as synonymous. Any the like occasion. To call a painting or a statue an occasion is not a happy expression, nor is it very proper to speak of calling up ideas by occasions. The common phrase, any such means, would have been more natural.

    There are few words—which are employed. It had been better if our author here had said more simply, few words in the English language are employed. Mr. Addison, whose style is of the free and full, rather than the nervous, kind, deals, on all occasions, in this extended sort of phraseology. But it is proper only when some assertion of consequence is advanced, and which can bear an emphasis, such as that in the first sentence of the former paragraph. On other occasions, these little words, it is, and there are, ought to be avoided as redundant and enfeebling. Those of the fancy and the imagination. ‘The article ought to have been omitted here. As he does not mean the powers of the fancy and the imagination but the words only, the article certainly had no proper place; neither, indeed, was there any occasion for the other two words, those of. Better if the sentence had run thus: "Few words in the English language are employed in a more loose and uncircumscribed sense than fancy and imagination."

    he is speaking were loose and uncircumscribed. Fix relates to the first of
    these, determine to the last. We fix what is loose; that is, we confine the
    word to its proper place that it may not fluctuate in our imagination and
    pass from one idea to another; and we determine what is uncircumscribed;
    that is, we ascertain its termini or limits, we draw the circle round it that
    we may see its boundaries. For we cannot conceive the meaning of a word,
    or indeed of any other thing, clearly, till we see its limits and know how
    far it extends. These two words, therefore, have grace and beauty as they
    are here applied, though a writer more frugal of words than Mr. Addison
    would have preferred the single word ascertain, which conveys, without
    any metaphor, the import of them both.

    The notion of these words is somewhat of a harsh phrase, at least not so
    commonly used as the meaning of these words. As I intend to make use
    of them in the thread of my speculations. This is plainly faulty. A sort of
    metaphor is improperly mixed with words in the literal sense. He might
    very well have said, as I intend to make use of them in my following specu-
    lations. This was plain language; but if he chose to borrow an allusion from
    thread, that allusion ought to have been supported; for there is no consistency
    in making use of them in the thread of speculations; and indeed, in express-
    ing anything so simple and familiar as this is, plain language is always to
    be preferred to metaphorical. The subject which I proceed upon is an un-
    graceful close of a sentence; better, the subject upon which I proceed.

    (9) I must therefore desire him to remember that, by the pleasures of
    the imagination, I mean only such pleasures as arise originally from
    sight, and that I divide these pleasures into two kinds.

    As the last sentence began with, I therefore thought it necessary to fix,
    it is careless to begin this sentence in a manner so very similar, J must there-
    fore desire him to remember—especially as the small variation of using, on
    this account or for this reason, in place of therefore would have amended the
    style. When he says, I mean only such pleasures, it may be remarked that
    the adverb only is not in its proper place. It is not intended here to qualify
    the word mean but such pleasures, and therefore should have been placed
    in as close a connexion as possible with the word which it limits or qualifies.
    The style becomes more clear and neat when the words are arranged thus:
    "By the pleasures of the imagination, I mean such pleasures only as arise
    from sight."

    (10) My design, being first of all to discourse of those primary pleasures
    of the imagination, which entirely proceed from such objects as are before
    our eyes; and, in the next place, to speak of those secondary pleasures of
    the imagination, which flow from the ideas of visible objects, when the
    objects are not actually before the eye but are called up into our memo-
    ries or formed into agreeable visions of things that are either absent or
    fictitious.

    It is a great rule in laying down the division of a subject to study neatness
    and brevity as much as possible. The divisions are then more distinctly
    apprehended and more easily remembered. This sentence is not perfectly
    happy in that respect. It is somewhat clogged by a tedious phraseology. My
    design being first of all, to discourse—in the next place, to speak of—such
    objects as are before our eyes—things that are either absent or fictitious.
    Several words might have been spared here; and the style made more neat
    and compact.

    (11) The pleasures of the imagination, taken in their full extent, are not
    so gross as those of sense, nor so refined as those of the understanding.

    This sentence is distinct and elegant.

    (12) The last are indeed more preferable, because they are founded on
    some new knowledge or improvement in the mind of man; yet it must
    be confessed that those of the imagination are as great and as transport-
    ing as the other.

    In the beginning of this sentence, the phrase more preferable is such a plain inaccuracy that one wonders how Mr. Addison should have fallen into it, seeing preferable, of itself, expresses the comparative degree and is the same with "more eligible" or "more excellent."

    I must observe farther that the proposition contained in the last member of this sentence is neither clear nor neatly expressed—it must be confessed that those of the imagination are as great and as transporting as the other. In the former sentence, he had compared three things together—the pleasures of the imagination, those of sense, and those of the understanding. In the beginning of this sentence, he had called the pleasures of the understanding the last; and he ends the sentence with observing that those of the imagination are as great and transporting as the other. Now, besides that the other makes not a proper contrast with the last, he leaves it ambiguous whether, by the other, he meant the pleasures of the understanding or the pleasures of the sense; for it may refer to either, by the construction; though, undoubtedly, he intended that it should refer to the pleasures of the understanding only. The proposition reduced to perspicuous language runs thus: "Yet it must be confessed that the pleasures of the imagination, when compared with those of the understanding, are no less great and transporting."

    (13) A beautiful prospect delights the soul as much as a demonstration; and a description in Homer has charmed more readers than a chapter in Aristotle.

    This is a good illustration of what he had been asserting and is expressed with that happy and elegant turn, for which our author is very remarkable.

    (14) Besides, the pleasures of the imagination have this advantage above those of the understanding, that they are more obvious and more easy to be acquired.

    This is also an unexceptionable sentence.

    (15) It is but opening the eye, and the scene enters.

    This sentence is lively and picturesque. By the gayety and briskness which it gives the style, it shows the advantage of intermixing such a short sentence as this amidst a run of longer ones, which never fails to have a happy effect. I must remark, however, a small inaccuracy. A scene cannot be said to enter; an actor enters, but a scene appears or presents itself.

    (16) The colours paint themselves on the fancy, with very little attention
    of thought or application of mind in the beholder.

    This is still a beautiful illustration, carried on with that agreeable floweriness
    of fancy and style which is so well suited to those pleasures of the imagi-
    nation of which the author is treating.

    (17) We are struck, we know not how, with the symmetry of anything
    we see, and immediately assent to the beauty of an object, without in-
    quiring into the particular causes and occasions of it.

    There is a falling off here from the elegance of the former sentences. We
    assent to the truth of a proposition but cannot so well be said to assent to
    the beauty of an object. Acknowledge would have expressed the sense with
    more propriety. The close of the sentence too is heavy and ungraceful—the
    particular causes and occasions of it; both particular and occasions are words
    quite superfluous; and the pronoun it is in some measure ambiguous,
    whether it refers to beauty or to object. It would have been some amendment
    to the style to have run thus: "We immediately acknowledge the
    beauty of an object, without inquiring into the cause of that beauty."

    (18) A man of polite imagination is let into a great many pleasures that
    the vulgar are not capable of receiving.

    Polite is a term more commonly applied to manners or behaviour than
    to the mind or imagination. There is nothing farther to be observed on this
    sentence, unless the use of that for a relative pronoun, instead of which

    (19) He can converse with a picture and find an agreeable companion in a statue. He meets with a secret refreshment in a description; and often feels a greater satisfaction in the prospect of fields and meadows than another does in the possession. It gives him, indeed, a kind of property in every thing he sees; and makes the most rude, uncultivated parts of nature administer to his pleasures: so that he looks upon the world, as it were, in another light and discovers in it a multitude of charms that conceal themselves from the generality of mankind.

    All this is very beautiful. The illustration is happy and the style runs with the greatest ease and harmony. We see no labour, no stiffness or affectation; but an author writing from the native flow of a gay and pleasing imagination. This predominant character of Mr. Addison's manner, far more than compensates all those little negligences which we are now remarking. Two of these occur in this paragraph. The first, in the sentence which begins with "It gives him, indeed, a kind of property." To this it there is no proper antecedent in the whole paragraph. In order to gather the meaning, we must look back as far as to the third sentence before, the first of the paragraph, which begins with "a man of a polite imagination." This phrase, polite imagination, is the only antecedent to which this it can refer; and even that is an improper antecedent, as it stands in the genitive case, as the qualification only of a man.

    The other instance of negligence is towards the end of the paragraph, so that he looks upon the world, as it were in another light. By another light, Mr. Addison means a light different from that in which other men view the world. But though this expression clearly conveyed this meaning to himself when writing, it conveys it very indistinctly to others and is an instance of that sort of inaccuracy, into which, in the warmth of composition, every writer of a lively imagination is apt to fall and which can only be remedied by a cool, subsequent review. As it were is upon most occasions no more than an ungraceful palliative; and here there was not the least occasion for it, as he was not about to say anything which required a softening of this kind. To say the truth, this last sentence, so that he looks upon the world, and what follows had better been wanting altogether. It is no more than an unnecessary recapitulation of what had gone before—a feeble adjection to the lively picture he had given of the pleasures of the imagination.

    (20) There are, indeed, but very few who know how to be idle and innocent, or have a relish of any pleasures that are not criminal; every diversion they take is at the expense of some one virtue or another, and their very first step out of business is into vice or folly.

    Nothing can be more elegant or more finely turned than this sentence. It is neat, clear, and musical. We could hardly alter one word or disarrange one member without spoiling it. Few sentences are to be found more finished or more happy.

    (21) A man should endeavour, therefore, to make the sphere of his innocent pleasures as wide as possible that he may retire into them with safety and find in them such a satisfaction as a wise man would not blush to take.

    (22) Of this nature are those of the imagination, which do not require
    such a bent of thought as is necessary to our more serious employments,
    nor, at the same time, suffer the mind to sink into that indolence and
    remissness, which are apt to accompany our more sensual delights; but
    like a gentle exercise to the faculties awaken them from sloth and idle-
    ness, without putting them upon any labour or difficulty.

    The beginning of this sentence is not correct and affords an instance of
    a period too loosely connected with the preceding one. Of this nature, says
    he, are those of the imagination. We might ask, of what nature? For it had
    not been the scope of the preceding sentence to describe the nature of any
    set of pleasures. He had said that it was every man's duty to make the sphere
    of his innocent pleasures as wide as possible, in order that, within that
    sphere, he might find a safe retreat and a laudable satisfaction. The transi-
    tion is loosely made by beginning the next sentence with saying, of this
    nature are those of the imagination. It had been better if, keeping in view
    the governing object of the preceding sentence, he had said, "This advan-
    tage we gain" or "This satisfaction we enjoy by means of the pleasures of
    imagination." The rest of the sentence is abundantly correct.

    (23) We might here add that the pleasures of the fancy are more con-
    ducive to health than those of the understanding, which are worked out
    by dint of thinking and attended with too violent a labour of the brain.

    On this sentence, nothing occurs deserving of remark, except that worked
    out by dint of thinking is a phrase which borders too much on vulgar and

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Textual Analysis of Transition in Rhetorical Composition\n\nExamine the transition between sentences 22 and 23 in the provided passage. The author describes how the pleasures of imagination are distinct from those that require serious thought.\n- **Part A**: Identify the flaw in the transition between sentences 22 and 23, as noted in the text. Explain why the sentence beginning with ''Of this nature are those of the imagination'' is problematic in terms of rhetorical coherence.\n- **Part B**: Propose a revised version of the transition that maintains the original meaning but improves the flow between the sentences.

    (24) Delightful scenes, whether in nature, painting, or poetry, have a
    kindly influence on the body, as well as the mind, and not only serve to
    clear and brighten the imagination but are able to disperse grief and
    melancholy and to set the animal spirits in pleasing and agreeable mo-
    tions. For this reason, Sir Francis Bacon, in his Essay upon Health, has
    not thought it improper to prescribe to his reader a poem or a prospect,
    where he particularly dissuades him from knotty and subtile disquisitions
    and advises him to pursue studies that fill the mind with splendid and
    illustrious objects, as histories, fables, and contemplations of nature.

    In the latter of these two sentences, a member of the period is altogether
    out of its place—which gives the whole sentence a harsh and disjointed cast
    and serves to illustrate the rules I formerly gave concerning arrangement.
    The wrong-placed member which I point at is this: where he particularly
    dissuades him from knotty and subtile disquisitions; these words should un-
    doubtedly have been placed not where they stand but thus: Sir Francis Bacon,
    in his Essay upon Health, where he particularly dissuades the reader from
    knotty and subtile speculations, has not thought it improper to prescribe to
    him etc. This arrangement reduces every thing into proper order.

    (25) I have in this paper, by way of introduction, settled the motion of
    those pleasures of the imagination, which are the subject of my present
    undertaking, and endeavoured, by several considerations, to recommend
    to my readers the pursuit of those pleasures; I shall, in my next paper,
    examine the several sources from whence these pleasures are derived.

    These two concluding sentences afford examples of the proper collocation
    of circumstances in a period. I formerly showed that it is often a matter of
    difficulty to dispose of them in such a manner as that they shall not embar-
    rass the principal subject of the sentence. In the sentences before us, several
    of these incidental circumstances necessarily come in—By way of introduc-
    tion—by several considerations—in this paper—in the next paper. All which
    are with great propriety managed by our author. It will be found, upon
    trial, that there were ne other parts of the sentence, in which they could
    have been placed to equal advantage. Had he said, for instance, "I have
    settled the notion (rather, the meaning) of those pleasures of the imagina-
    tion, which are the subject of my present undertaking, by way of introduc-
    tion, in this paper, and endeavoured to recommend the pursuit of those
    pleasures to my readers, by several considerations," we must be sensible
    that the sentence, thus clogged with circumstances in the wrong place, would
    neither have been so neat nor so clear, as it is by the present construction.

    JOHN F. KENNEDY: INAUGURAL ADDRESS

    (January 20, 1961)

    1 We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom,
    symbolizing an end as well as a beginning, signifying renewal as well as
    change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn
    oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.

    2 The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the
    power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.
    And yet the same revolutionary belief for which our forebears fought is
    still at issue around the globe, the belief that the rights of man come not
    from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.

    3 We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution.
    Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike,
    that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans, born in
    this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud
    of our ancient heritage, and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing
    of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and
    to which we are committed today at home and around the world.

    4 Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall
    pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend,
    oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.

    5 This much we pledge—and more.

    6 To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we
    pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United, there is little we cannot do in
    a host of co-operative ventures. Divided, there is little we can do, for we
    dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.

    7 'To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we
    pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed
    away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always
    expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find
    them strongly supporting their own freedom, and to remember that, in
    the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger
    ended up inside.

    8 To those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling
    to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them
    help themselves, for whatever period is required, not because the Com-
    munists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is
    right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save
    the few who are rich.

    9 To our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge: to convert our good words into good deeds, in a new alliance for progress, to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty. But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers. Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. And let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house.

    10 To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support: to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective, to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak, and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.

    11 Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.

    12 We dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.

    13 But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course—both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war.

    14 So let us begin anew, remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.

    15 Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.

    16 Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms, and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations.

    18 Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command
    of Isaiah to "undo the heavy burdens...[and] let the oppressed go free."
    1g And if a beachhead of co-operation may push back the jungle of sus-

    20 All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it
    be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administra-
    tion, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.

    21 In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final
    success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each gen-
    eration of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national
    loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service
    surround the globe.

    22 Now the trumpet summons us again—not as a call to bear arms, though
    arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are; but a call
    to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, "re-
    joicing in hope, patient in tribulation," a struggle against the common
    enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself.

    23 Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North
    and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all man-
    kind? Will you join in that historic effort?

    24 In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been
    granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I
    do not shrink from this responsibility; I welcome it. I do not believe that
    any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other genera-
    tion. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor
    will light our country and all who serve it, and the glow from that fire
    can truly light the world.

    JOHN F. KENNEDY'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS

    As rhetoric has become an increasingly dispensable member of the liberal
    arts, people have abandoned the idea, held so firmly by the ancient Greeks
    and Romans, that eloquence is indispensable to politics. Perhaps President
    Kennedy's achievements in both spheres will revive a taste for good oratory

    —a taste that has been alternately frustrated by inarticulateness and dulled
    by bombast. There have been a few notable orators in our day—most
    recently Adlai Stevenson—but they have been the exceptions, and it has
    taken Mr. Kennedy's success as a politician to suggest that the power to
    "enchant souls through words" (Socrates) may soon be at a premium once
    more. Whatever the impact of the Inaugural Address on contemporary
    New Frontiersmen, we find it hard to believe that an Athenian or Roman
    citizen could have listened to it unmoved, or that Cicero, however jealous
    of his own reputation, would have found reason to object to it.

    We are all familiar by now with the generally high praise the President received for his first speech, but before the responsibility for a final judgment is yielded to Time it would be a shame not to seek the opinion of a couple of true professionals. Both Aristotle and Cicero, the one a theorist and the other a theorizing orator, believed that rhetoric could be an art to the extent that the orator was, first, a logician and, second, a psychologist with an appreciation and understanding of words. Cicero felt further, that the ideal orator was the thoroughly educated man. (He would be pleased by Mr. Kennedy's background, with its strong emphasis on affairs of state: the philosopher-orator-statesman.) Of the three types of oratory defined by the ancients—political, forensic, and display (in which audience participation was limited to a judgment of style)—the political was esteemed most highly, because it dealt with the loftiest of issues; namely, the fate of peoples, rather than of individuals. ("Now the trumpet summons us again... against the common enemies of man....") The ideal speech was thought to be one in which three kinds of persuasion were used by the speaker: logical, to present the facts of the case and construct an argument based on them; emotional, to reach the audience psychologically; and "ethical," to appeal to the audience by establishing one's own integrity and sincerity. The Inaugural Address, being a variation on the single theme of man's rights and obligations, is not primarily logical, although it contains no illogic; it is an appeal to men's souls rather than to their minds. During the Presidential campaign, Mr. Kennedy tested and patented an exercise in American psychology that proved to be all the emotional appeal he required for the inaugural speech: "And so, my fellow-Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country." His ethical persuasion, or indication of his personal probity, consisted of an extension of that appeal: "...ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you."

    Aristotle recognized only one (good) style, while Cicero thought that there were three styles—the plain, the middle, and the grand. To Aristotle, who considered it sufficient for a style to be clear and appropriate, avoiding undue elevation (whence bombast) and excessive lowliness, it would have seemed that Mr. Kennedy had achieved the Golden Mean. The formality of the Inaugural Address ("To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations...") is appropriate to the subject; the language ("In your hands, my fellow-citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course") is clear and direct. Cicero's ideal orator was able to speak in all three styles, in accordance with the demands of his subject, and in that respect Mr. Kennedy filled the role by speaking plainly on the practical ("All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days"), by speaking formally but directly on the purpose of national defense ("For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed"), and by speaking grandly on the potential accomplishments of the movement toward the New Frontier ("The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it—and the glow from that fire can truly light the world").

    certain traditions and rituals. A speech delivered on such an occasion is usu-
    ally of the ceremonial variety, although there may be deliberative elements
    in it. What the people have come to expect is not so much a speech that lays
    down a specific program as a speech that sets a mood. In striking the keynote
    of the coming administration, the speaker will try to heal the wounds that
    may have been inflicted during the campaign, to remind the audience of a
    common heritage and a common purpose, to set forth, in a general way, the
    policies and objectives of the new administration, and to reassure the inter-
    national community of the continuity and determination of the nation.

    Since a ceremonial speech like this deals in generalities rather than in par-
    ticulars, it can very easily slip off into platitude and pious cant. In seeking
    to please everyone with a "safe" speech, the speaker runs the risk of pleasing
    no one. In striving for that happy mean between the general and the specific,
    between the trite and the bizarre, and between the offensive and the fulsome,
    the speaker will have to draw on all his ingenuity to come up with a content
    and a form that will impress his audience without boring them.

    Having characterized the kind of speech that is usually delivered at an
    inauguration, we might consider now the special situation that faced Presi-
    dent Kennedy on that January morning in 1961. John Fitzgerald Kennedy
    was the youngest man and the first Catholic to be elected to the highest
    office in America, and he had been elected by a narrow margin of votes. His
    youth, his religious affiliation, and his narrow victory at the polls—all these
    combined to establish some doubts about him in the minds of his own people
    and the people of other countries. Having created an image, during the cam-
    paign, of enormous vitality and considerable political shrewdness, this leader
    of the New Frontier had to fulfill his promise to push the country forward.
    Clearly, this was an occasion when a powerful ethical appeal would have to
    be exerted if the confidence and initiative of the people were to be aroused.

    What about the audience for this address? There would be the immediate
    audience—the high dignitaries on the platform and the thousands of people
    gathered in the plaza in front of the Capitol building. Then there were the
    millions of people who would see and hear the speaker through the medium
    of television. And finally there would be the millions of people in foreign
    lands who would read accounts of the speech in their newspapers the next
    day. Taken together, this was a vast, heterogeneous audience, posing special
    problems for the speaker. As we have remarked before, the larger and more
    heterogeneous the audience is, the more difficult it is to adjust the discourse
    to fit the audience. In his content and his style, the President must strike
    some common denominator—but a common denominator that does not fall
    below the dignity that the occasion demands.

    Having looked at the general situation that prevailed for the speech, let
    510 STYLE

    us now see how the President accommodated his means to his end. In this
    analysis, of course, we are going to investigate only the way in which the
    President accommodated his style to the subject matter, occasion, audience,
    and his own personality.

    The Speech as a Whole

    One of the first things that strikes the reader is the relative brevity of the
    speech—1343 words, which at the normal rate for public address would take
    between nine and ten minutes to deliver. When the President wrote this
    speech he could not have known that the "live" audience for the speech
    would be standing in the biting cold that followed a heavy snowstorm in the
    Washington area on the day before the inauguration. So the President had
    not made his speech brief out of consideration for his wind-chilled audience.
    In preparing the speech, however, he might have taken into consideration
    that it would be delivered at the end of some lengthy preliminary speech-
    making. But perhaps the consideration that mainly determined the brevity
    of the speech was the traditional nature of inaugural addresses. As we have
    observed, inaugural addresses usually deal in broad, undeveloped generali-
    ties. Principles, policies, and promises are enunciated without elaboration.

    The relative brevity of the speech is reflected in the paragraph and sentence structure. A glance at the printed text of the speech reveals a succession of short paragraphs. Of the twenty-seven paragraphs in the speech, ten have only one sentence; seven paragraphs are two sentences long; and another seven are three sentences long. The longest paragraphs (g and 24) contain only four sentences. In terms of averages, there are 49.3 words per paragraph and 1.92 sentences per paragraph.

    The President is trying to cover a lot of ground in this short speech. In order to do this, he enunciates his principles, promises, and policies in a litany of capsule paragraphs. The effect of these unelaborated paragraphs would have been slight if the President had not rendered many of those paragraphs memorable by the brilliance of his style.

    Sentences: Length

    Descending to the next smallest unit of discourse, the sentence, we note some interesting facts about the length and kinds of sentences. The two extremes of sentence length are represented by the sentence of eighty words (second sentence of paragraph 3) and the sentence of four words (third sentence of paragraph 20). The average length of the President's sentences is 25.8 words. But what is more revealing about the President's style is the variation above and below this average. Fourteen of the fifty-two sentences (27%) are longer than the average, and twenty-eight (54%) are shorter. This variation suggests a deliberate use of sentence structure to create rhythm and emphasis in the speech.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Rhythm and Sentence Structure in Presidential Speech**\n\nAnalyze the sentence structure of the President''s speech based on the provided statistics.

    per cent) in the speech are ten words or more above the average; but twenty-
    three sentences (44 per cent) are five words or more below the average.
    Although the President has a number of unusually long sentences—66 words
    (paragraph 10), 64 words (paragraph 22), 54 words (paragraphs 8 and 13)
    —an unusually high proportion of his sentences are composed of twenty
    words or less. Even by modern journalistic standards, a twenty-word sen-
    tence is short. This high proportion of short sentences matches the over-all
    brevity of the speech and the short paragraphs. Although the President dis-
    plays an admirable variety in sentence-length, his heavy use of the short
    sentence does suggest that he had his /istening audience in mind when he
    composed his speech. Another consideration that may have influenced the
    President in the use of short sentences is that short sentences help to create
    the effect of sententiousness that is appropriate for a ceremonial speech.

    Sentences: Grammatical Types

    Having noted a high proportion of relatively short sentences, we might ex-
    pect that a majority of the sentences would be of the simple or compound
    type. But a close investigation of the grammatical types reveals that this is
    not so. Twenty (38.4 per cent) of the sentences are simple; only six (11.6
    per cent) sentences are compound. But twenty-six sentences (exactly 50 per
    cent) are complex. Taken together, the simple and compound sentences con-
    stitute 50 per cent of the whole, but the predominant grammatical type is
    the complex sentence. What this reveals is that the President manages the
    expansion of his sentences mainly through the sophisticated pattern of sub-
    ordination. A study of the sequence of sentences, however, shows how well
    the President has mixed the grammatical types in order to avoid monotony
    of structure. Only in a half dozen or so places in the speech does he string
    together two or more sentences of the same grammatical type.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Grammatical Sentence Types**\n\nBased on the text''s classification of sentences into simple, compound, and complex types, explain why the President''s speech contains 26 complex sentences (50 per cent) despite having only six compound sentences (11.6 per cent).\n- **Step 1**: Identify the grammatical features that define a complex sentence.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the use of subordinate clauses in complex sentences allows for sentence expansion without increasing length.\n- **Step 3**: Articulate the significance of this grammatical choice in maintaining variety while avoiding monotony, as noted in the text''s discussion of sentence sequence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reference the text''s specific numbers (26 complex sentences, 6 compound sentences) and demonstrate understanding of how subordination affects sentence structure.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Rhetorical Implications of Sentence Structure**\n\nThe text suggests that the President''s use of short sentences may have been intentional to create ''sententiousness'' appropriate for a ceremonial speech. Construct an argument that connects the use of short sentences and complex grammatical structures to the rhetorical purpose of the speech.\n- **Step 1**: Define ''sententiousness'' based on the text''s description.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how short sentences contribute to a direct and impactful delivery, as noted in the text''s discussion of ''listening audience.''\n- **Step 3**: Demonstrate how complex sentences allow for nuanced expression without sacrificing brevity, using examples from the text''s analysis of subordination.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the text''s mention of ''sententiousness'' and the President''s potential audience, linking both elements to the overall rhetorical strategy of the speech.'

    When we study the rhetorical patterns of the speech, we note another interesting feature of President Kennedy's style. The predominant rhetorical structure is antithesis. This recurring structure was perhaps dictated by the fact that the speech deals mainly with comparisons of opposites (end—beginning, old—new, rich—poor, friend-enemy). He strikes the theme of the speech and the antithetical keynote in the first sentence: "We observe today not a victory of party/ but a celebration of freedom—symbolizing an end/ as well as a beginning—signifying renewal/ as well as change." Additional examples of antithesis are not hard to find:

    to friend and foe alike (paragraph 3)
    United ... Divided (paragraph 6)
    512 STYLE

    To those old allies ...'To those new states (paragraphs 6, 7)

    If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the
    few who are rich. (paragraph 8)

    What problems unite us...those problems which divide us (para-
    graph 15)

    And the most memorable line of the speech is cast in the form of an an-
    tithesis:

    ... Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for
    your country.

    Most of these antitheses of thought are laid out in parallel grammatical
    structure. The recurring parallelism is appropriate here because although the
    President is pointing up opposites by his antitheses he wants to suggest that
    these opposites can be reconciled. Opposites can be reconciled only if they
    are co-ordinate, and one way to emphasize the co-ordinate value of opposites
    is to juxtapose them in a parallel grammatical structure.

    The other use that the President makes of parallelism is for the purpose
    of specification or enumeration, as in these three examples:

    born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter
    peace, proud of our ancient heritage (paragraph 3)

    pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend,
    oppose any foe (paragraph 4)

    Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease,
    and encourage the arts and commerce (paragraph 17)

    As we shall see when we come to study the figures of speech, there are additional schemes intertwined in many of these parallel and antithetical patterns.

    Before concluding this section on rhetorical patterns, we shall point out some other features of style. If the student needed any evidence to justify his use of a co-ordinating conjunction at the beginning of the sentence, he could cite this speech. The President begins fourteen of his sentences (over 25 per cent) with a co-ordinating conjunction. There is, of course, ample precedent for this usage in modern prose and the prose of earlier centuries. But it is interesting to note how effective rhetorically this means of articulating sentences is in the President's speech. Let us look at just one example of this usage:

    We dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed. (paragraph 12)

    Contrast the effect of this with the following:

    We dare not tempt them with weakness, for only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.

    The content and rhetorical scheme of both sentences is exactly the same, and perhaps if one were reading the second sentence aloud he could produce the same effect as the first sentence has. But on the printed page, a special emphasis is achieved by setting off the second clause in a sentence by itself and by signaling the syllogistic relationship of the two clauses by the capitalized initial For. If the student analyzes the other uses of initial co-ordinating conjunctions, he will usually find some rhetorical purpose being served.

    The overwhelming majority of the sentences are declarative. This proportion
    is appropriate in a speech that is designed to inform and reassure the world
    about the objectives of the new administration. Occasionally, however, the
    President uses some other functional types of sentence. In paragraph 23, he
    uses two rhetorical questions ("Can we forge against these enemies a grand
    and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more
    fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?"). These
    questions occur at the point in the speech when the President is about to
    launch into his peroration. Up to this point the President has been declaring
    what he will do, what the American people will do. Now he wants to sug-
    gest what the international community can do to support his program of
    peace and prosperity. But he can only suggest—he cannot dictate or predict
    —what other countries will do. The rhetorical questions are phrased in such
    a way, however, that the natural answer to them is a resounding Yes.

    The President groups together two other types of functional sentences—
    imperatives and hortatives. In paragraphs 25, 26, 27 (the concluding para-
    graphs of the speech), we see three sharp imperatives, using the verb to
    ask, which leave the citizens with a call to action. Up to this point, the audi-
    ence have been mere listeners to this ceremonial discourse. Now the audience
    must be engaged actively. The imperatives point to the general line of action
    that they must take.

    The series of fourteen hortative sentences ("Let us... Let both sides...")
    in paragraphs 14 through 20 also lays down a program of action, but the
    directives are softened by being cast in a hortatory form. (The Latin and
    Greek languages would have used the subjunctive mood of the verb to create
    this effect.) The President here is seeking to induce action, not command it
    In other words, he wants to persuade rather than coerce.

    And the most memorable line of the speech is cast in the form of an antithesis:

    ... Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for
    your country.

    Most of these antitheses of thought are laid out in parallel grammatical
    structure. The recurring parallelism is appropriate here because although the
    President is pointing up opposites by his antitheses he wants to suggest that
    these opposites can be reconciled. Opposites can be reconciled only if they
    are co-ordinate, and one way to emphasize the co-ordinate value of opposites
    is to juxtapose them in a parallel grammatical structure.

    The other use that the President makes of parallelism is for the purpose
    of specification or enumeration, as in these three examples:

    born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter
    peace, proud of our ancient heritage (paragraph 3)

    pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend,
    oppose any foe (paragraph 4)

    Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease,
    and encourage the arts and commerce (paragraph 17)

    As we shall see when we come to study the figures of speech, there are additional
    schemes intertwined in many of these parallel and antithetical patterns.

    Before concluding this section on rhetorical patterns, we shall point out
    some other features of style. If the student needed any evidence to justify
    his use of a co-ordinating conjunction at the beginning of the sentence, he
    could cite this speech. The President begins fourteen of his sentences (over
    25 per cent) with a co-ordinating conjunction. There is, of course, ample
    precedent for this usage in modern prose and the prose of earlier centuries.
    But it is interesting to note how effective rhetorically this means of articulat-
    ing sentences is in the President's speech. Let us look at just one example of
    this usage:

    We dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are
    sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will
    never be employed. (paragraph 12)

    Contrast the effect of this with the following:

    We dare not tempt them with weakness, for only when our arms are
    sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will
    never be employed.

- prompt: |-
    The content and rhetorical scheme of both sentences is exactly the same, and perhaps if one were reading the second sentence aloud he could produce the same effect as the first sentence has. But on the printed page, a special emphasis is achieved by setting off the second clause in a sentence by itself and by signaling the syllogistic relationship of the two clauses by the capitalized initial For. If the student analyzes the other uses of initial co-ordinating conjunctions, he will usually find some rhetorical purpose being served.

    514 STYLE

    Diction

    The diction of the speech unobtrusively but unmistakably exerts an influence on the effect of the speech. The simplicity of the diction is perhaps not immediately noticeable, but when one studies it, one notes that there is almost no word that a moderately intelligent high-school graduate would have to look up in a dictionary. A closer study of the diction reveals a high proportion of monosyllabic words: some 951 words in the speech (71 per cent) are monosyllabic. In paragraphs 19 and 20, the proportion of monosyllabic words is as high as 80 per cent. Even in the peroration of the speech, where one might expect the orator to make use of the sonorous cadence that can be achieved with polysyllabic diction, one finds a high proportion of one-syllable words. This monosyllabism helps to account not only for the impression of simplicity but also for the note of strength in the speech—a note that people had come to associate with the vigor of this youthful public figure. In working over the drafts of the speech, the President must consciously have sought out simple, Anglo-Saxon words.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Analysis of Diction in Persuasive Speech**\n\nThe text discusses the use of simple, monosyllabic words in a presidential speech. Consider the diction and its impact on the speech''s effect:\n- **Part A**: Explain how the high proportion of monosyllabic words (951 in total, 71%) contributes to the speech''s perceived simplicity and strength.\n- **Part B**: Justify why the use of simple diction aligns with the speech''s goal of persuasion rather than coercion, based on the text''s mention of hortatory language.\n- **Part C**: Compare the diction in paragraphs 19-20 (80% monosyllabic) with the overall speech. What does this contrast reveal about the speaker''s rhetorical strategy?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s analysis of diction and its relationship to persuasion, using specific percentages and examples from the passage.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Strategies**\n\nThe text highlights the President''s use of hortatory language (e.g., ''Let us... Let both sides...'') to induce action rather than command it. Analyze the rhetorical strategy in the context of the speech''s purpose:\n- **Part A**: Explain how hortatory language differs from imperative commands in terms of its effect on the audience.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the combination of hortatory language and simple diction reinforces the speech''s persuasive intent.\n- **Part C**: Propose a counterargument to the claim that ''complex language is more effective in persuasion.'' Support your argument with evidence from the text and examples of real-world communication.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of both diction and hortatory language, using specific examples from the text and logical reasoning about persuasive techniques.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Rhetorical Elements**\n\nThe text describes the President''s conscious effort to use simple words in his speech. Consider the implications of this choice in a broader rhetorical context:\n- **Part A**: Why might the use of Anglo-Saxon words (simple, familiar vocabulary) be more effective in influencing a general audience than Latin or Greek terms?\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument that the high proportion of monosyllabic words (71%) is a deliberate choice to enhance the speech''s ''note of strength.'' Support your argument with references to the text and logical reasoning about language perception.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the claim that ''simplicity in diction always undermines the authority of the speaker.'' Use the text to argue against this claim, providing a counterexample that demonstrates how simplicity can coexist with authority.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s analysis of diction and its relationship to rhetorical effectiveness, using logical reasoning and examples from the passage.'

    Having noted the high proportion of monosyllabic words, one might ex-
    pect to find also a high proportion of concrete words. But this is not the case.
    Investigation of the nouns in the speech turns up many abstract words—
    words like freedom, poverty, tyranny, loyalty, devotion, responsibility, ag-
    gression, subversion. And most of this abstract diction is Latinate and poly-
    syllabic. Aside from the figures of speech—which we will investigate later—
    there are surprisingly few concrete words—huts, villages, stars, deserts,
    graves. Whatever air of concreteness the speech has is created by the figures
    of speech. Perhaps the high proportion of abstract words is the natural con-
    sequence of the brief, unelaborated character of the speech. Once the Presi-
    dent had decided to enunciate only the broad, general policy of his adminis-
    tration, it was almost inevitable that most of his substantive words would be
    abstract. What we have in this short speech really is a series of undeveloped
    topic sentences.

    Another thing that accounts for the formal quality of this ceremonial
    speech is the occasional use of slightly archaic diction. We find the President
    using such words as forebears (twice), host, anew, asunder, foe, adversary,
    writ. Besides echoing the tone of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address ("Fourscore
    and seven years ago," "our fathers," "final resting-place," "hallow"), this
    quaint diction has Biblical overtones and a certain appropriateness to the
    old-new motif. The President reinforced the effect of this kind of diction by
    two quotations from the Old Testament and the folksy adage about riding
    the back of the tiger. The repetition of certain honorific key terms, like
    pledge, citizens, peace also helps to reinforce the reverential tone of the
    speech.

    Figures of Speech: Schemes

    First of all, let us look at some of the schemes—those patternings of words
    which represent departures from the ordinary way of speaking. Since we
    have already remarked about the pervasive parallelism and antithesis in the
    speech, we will concentrate here on some of the other schemes.

- prompt: "There are a number of schemes of repetition. The most notable of these  \nis anaphora—repetition of the same words at the beginning of successive  \nclauses. Anaphora is conspicuous in two key passages in the speech: the sec-  \ntion (paragraphs 6-11) in which the President is making a series of pledges  \n(\"To those...\"); and the section (paragraphs 15-18) in which the President  \nis suggesting a course of action (\"Let both sides...\"). We have previously  \nobserved that these two sections make use of parallelism. The addition of  \nanaphora to these passages performs two functions: it combines with the  \nparallelism to mark off and emphasize the co-ordinateness of the series, and  \nit helps to establish the rhythm of the passages. The speech has no example  \nof the opposite scheme, epistrophe (repetition of the same word at the end  \nof successive clauses), but it does have two examples of repetition of similar  \nwords in a medial position: \"bear any burden, meet any hardship, support  \nany friend, oppose any foe\" (paragraph 4); \"sufficient beyond doubt...  \ncertain beyond doubt\" (paragraph 12).\n\nThe most remembered sentence in the speech—\"ask not what your country  \ncan do for you—ask what you can do for your country\"—contains a figure  \nof repetition known as antimetabole (repetition of words in converse order).  \nAnother memorable utterance—\"Let us never negotiate out of fear. But never  \nfear to negotiate\"—appears to be another example of antimetabole, but it is  \nmore accurately classified as polyptoton (repetition of words derived from  \nthe same root). Here we have different conjugates of the word fear—serving  \nas a noun in the first clause and as an infinitive in the second clause. There  \nis another example of polyptoton in paragraph 22 (\"Not as a call to battle,  \nthough embattled we are\")—although, as the editors of the New Yorker  \nobserved, there is a suggestion here too of the trope called paronomasia (play  \non words).\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."

  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Rhetorical Repetition**\n\nDesign a short rhetorical passage (3-5 sentences) that incorporates at least two of the repetition schemes discussed in the text. Your passage must:\n- **Part A**: Use anaphora and parallel structure.\n- **Part B**: Include a form of antimetabole or polyptoton.\n- **Part C**: Explain the rhetorical effect of your chosen repetition schemes in a brief analysis.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s examples and show how your original passage effectively employs rhetorical repetition to achieve a specific purpose.'

    President Kennedy made sparing use of the scheme of repetition known as
    alliteration. There are only two instances of noticeable alliteration in the
    speech—"the area in which its writ may run" (paragraph 10); "to lead
    the Jand we Jove" (paragraph 27). Perhaps in accord with his personality, the
    President avoided frequent use of alliteration because of the soft, effeminate
    sound-effect often produced by this figure; the President was striving for a
    note of strength and vigor. One wonders, though, whether the President did
    not intend some sound-effect of appropriate harshness in the succession of
    s and d sounds in "before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by sci-
    ence engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction" (para-
    graph 11).

    Let us look briefly at a few more schemes. In most of his parallel series, the
    President shows a preference for the hurried rhythms that can be achieved
    with asyndeton (omission of conjunctions)—e.g. "born in this century, tem-
    pered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient
    heritage" (paragraph 3). The President makes little use of the scheme called
    anastrophe (unusual word order). In the entire speech, there is only one
    structure that is inverted: "United, there is little we cannot do in a host of
    co-operative ventures. Divided, there is little we can do" (paragraph 6). It
    is easy to see the special emphasis the President achieves here by placing the
    past participles in the initial position, even though these participles do not
    modify, as they normally do in this position, the subject of the main clause.
    One could regard this structure, however, as ellipsis rather than anastrophe.
    The closest the President comes to the figure known as climax is in para-
    graphs 25, 26, 27; but even here we have to strain a bit to find any element
    of rising importance in the series.

    Although the President makes rather skillful use of the schemes, he is less satisfactory in his use of tropes. There are a number of metaphors in the speech, and those metaphors represent, as we remarked earlier, the chief way in which the President introduces concreteness into the speech. But many of these metaphors—"the torch," "bonds of mass misery," "the chains of poverty," "corners of the earth," "the trumpet," "the glow from that fire"—are rather hackneyed. He achieves a little more freshness in some of his more subtle metaphors, like "iron tyranny," "destruction unleashed," "twilight struggle," "forge." Perhaps his most successful metaphor is the one in paragraph 19—"And if a beachhead of co-operation may push back the jungle of suspicion." By themselves, beachhead and jungle are rather shopworn metaphors, but they acquire a certain freshness by being combined in a complex metaphor.

    The several uses of "hands" (part for the whole) and "arms" (genus for the species) can be looked upon as examples of synecdoche, but those tropes too are fairly trite. The use of "hand" in paragraph 13—"that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war"—should be classified as an instance of personification rather than of synecdoche. Perhaps the only other expression in the speech which might be read as an instance of personification is found in the last paragraph—"with history the final judge of our deeds."

  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Metaphor and Trope Analysis\n\nAnalyze the President''s use of metaphors in the speech, specifically focusing on the metaphor ''the beachhead of cooperation'' from paragraph 19.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the literal and figurative meanings of ''beachhead'' and ''jungle.''\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the combination of these two metaphors creates a new, complex meaning.\n- **Step 3**: Compare this to the ''iron tyranny'' metaphor, discussing how its simplicity contributes to its effectiveness.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concept of metaphor as a means to introduce concreteness, and you must explicitly reference at least two metaphors from the text in your analysis.'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Synecdoche and Personification Analysis\n\nExamine the use of ''hands'' and ''arms'' in the speech.\n- **Part A**: Determine whether these are examples of synecdoche or personification. Justify your answer using the definitions provided in the text.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the specific example of ''that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind''s final war.'' Explain why this is an instance of personification rather than synecdoche.\n- **Part C**: Contrast the use of ''hand'' in paragraph 13 with its use in the last paragraph, discussing how each serves different rhetorical purposes.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly distinguish between synecdoche and personification, and you must reference specific examples from the text in your explanation.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Rhetorical Devices and Logical Reasoning\n\nThe text discusses various rhetorical devices used in the speech. Consider the claim that ''all metaphors are inherently cliché.''\n- **Part A**: Provide evidence from the text to support or refute this claim. Use at least two metaphors discussed in the passage as examples.\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument for why some metaphors are more effective than others, based on the text''s discussion of ''freshness'' and ''hackneyed'' expressions.\n- **Part C**: Propose a hypothetical speech scenario where the use of rare, non-cliché metaphors would be particularly effective. Justify your recommendation using the text''s analysis of metaphor and tropes.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s analysis of rhetorical devices and apply it to a hypothetical situation.'

    Undoubtedly, a good deal of the effect of this speech was produced by the "style" of delivery. Those who watched the inauguration ceremonies on television may recall the President's clear, crisp voice, the distinctive Bostonian accent, the mannerisms of the jabbing finger, the pauses, the inflections, the stresses. All of these features of voice and gesture helped to put the speech across; combined with the carefully worked-out style, they helped to communicate the President's message to the electorate and to the world. And perhaps it would be well for the student who has read this close analysis of the style to put the speech together again by listening to it on one of the many memorial records that were issued shortly after the President's assassination. Listening to a recording of the speech will make the student aware that this was a discourse designed for oral delivery, and it might prove interesting to note how much of the highly refined style of the speech comes through to the student once he has had the devices of style pointed out to him.

    Concluding Remarks

    The various stylistic devices we have been observing may be looked upon by some people as the ornamentation of the speech. These devices do "dress up" the speech, but if they are regarded as no more than ornamentation, they have failed to perform the functions that rhetoricians traditionally assigned to them. These formal devices should be one of the carriers of meaning. If the diction, the composition of words, and the figures of speech are not functioning to clarify, enliven, and emphasize the thought, if they are not exerting an ethical, emotional, or logical appeal, then indeed the style of a piece is so much sounding brass and tinkling cymbals, so much sound and fury signifying nothing.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Devices in Speech Analysis**\n\nThe text discusses the importance of rhetorical devices in conveying meaning beyond mere ornamentation. Using examples from the passage, explain how the President''s speech might have utilized specific devices (e.g., ''jabbing finger,'' ''pauses,'' ''inflections'') to achieve its rhetorical purpose.\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least three rhetorical devices mentioned in the text and explain how they contribute to communication.\n- **Step 2**: Relate each device to the broader function of style in rhetoric as described by Corbett.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a comparison between the President''s speech and the ''sounding brass and tinkling cymbals'' metaphor in terms of effectiveness.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate specific examples from the text and demonstrate an understanding of rhetorical functions as outlined in the passage.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Evaluation of Style and Meaning**\n\nThe text argues that stylistic devices should function as carriers of meaning, not just ornaments. Using the passage''s definition of ''sounding brass and tinkling cymbals,'' construct an argument about whether the President''s speech was effective in achieving its rhetorical goals.\n- **Part A**: Analyze the President''s speech based on the text''s criteria for effective style.\n- **Part B**: Compare this to a hypothetical speech that uses only ornamentation, arguing why the President''s approach was more impactful.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on function over ornamentation influences your understanding of effective communication.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must address all three components and demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s central argument.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nThe text contrasts ''ornamentation'' with ''carriers of meaning.'' Using this distinction, explain why the author considers ''sounding brass and tinkling cymbals'' as ineffective.\n- **Part A**: Define ''ornamentation'' and ''carriers of meaning'' based on the text.\n- **Part B**: Using examples from the passage, show how the President''s speech fulfills the role of a ''carrier of meaning.''\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument that if a speech fails to function as a ''carrier of meaning,'' it is essentially meaningless, and apply this logic to the metaphor of ''sounding brass and tinkling cymbals.''\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate all three parts and demonstrate a clear grasp of the text''s central thesis.'

    It is not so important that the style of the speech be recognizable as the
    "Kennedy style" as it is that the style be seen as appropriate to the subject
    matter, the occasion, the purpose, and the audience. Just as Lincoln's Gettys-
    burg Address was not particularly impressive to the audience who heard it
    in the National Cemetery on November 19, 1863, so Kennedy's Inaugural
    Address was not—if we may judge from the restrained applause that greeted
    it while it was being delivered—notably impressive to the audience who
    heard it in the snow-packed Capitol Plaza on January 20, 1961. It is only
    when we get a chance to read and reread Lincoln's and Kennedy's speeches
    that we realize what splendid performances they were. Only a close analysis
    such as we have engaged in can make us aware of the great care and de-
    liberation President Kennedy devoted to the "expression" of his speech. So

    much eloquence did not come by chance. It had to come from calculated
    choices from among a number of possibilities.

    We should now be in a better position to judge whether the President's
    choices were judicious. And we should be in a better position to predict
    whether future generations will judge this Inaugural Address to be one of
    the noblest utterances to issue from the lips of an American statesman.

    JOHN HENRY NEWMAN: A COLLECTION OF REMARKS ON STYLE

    The modern student could gain a complete course in the art of rhetoric by
    studying the public addresses and writings of John Henry Newman. New-
    man was engaged in controversy of some sort or other throughout most of
    his adult life, and most of his lectures, sermons, tracts, essays, letters, and
    books had a persuasive purpose—even when they purported to be primarily
    expository. Newman had been exposed to rhetoric while he was a student at
    Trinity College, Oxford; he had an intimate knowledge of Aristotle's Rhet-
    oric and of Cicero's orations; he delighted in the debating activities in the
    Oriel Commons Room; and when he was a fellow at Oriel, he helped Rich-
    ard Whately prepare the articles on logic that Whately later expanded into
    a highly successful companion textbook to his Elements of Rhetoric.

His attitude toward style is epitomized  \nby his recognition that logos signified for the Greeks both thought and word.  \nDuring his teenage years Newman made a systematic effort to cultivate his  \nstyle by imitating some of the recognized masters of English prose. Some  \nstudents today find Newman's style too \"Ciceronian\" for their taste, but no  \none can deny that Newman has one of the most limpid styles in English  \nletters. From a man who wrote as brilliantly and as effectively as Newman  \nwrote we would expect to learn some valuable lessons on style. The following  \nremarks on style occurred passim in \"Literature,\" \"English Catholic Literature,\"  \n\"Elementary Studies,\" and \"University Preaching\"—four of the dt courses that Newman included in the volume to which he gave the title The  \nIdea of a University.\n\nAnd, since the thoughts and reasonings of an author have, as I have said, a  \npersonal character, no wonder that his style is not only the image of his sub-  \nject, but of his mind.

  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Newman''s Style and Its Relevance**\n\nNewman''s style is described as ''limpid'' and ''Ciceronian,'' yet some find it too formal for modern tastes. Using the text, explain why Newman''s style might be considered both ''limpid'' and ''Ciceronian,'' and how this relates to his views on the role of style in intellectual discourse.\n- **Step 1**: Define ''limpid'' and ''Ciceronian'' based on the text''s description.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how these characteristics reflect Newman''s philosophical approach to style.\n- **Step 3**: Connect this to the text''s assertion that ''style is the image of the mind.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of both Newman''s and Aristotle''s perspectives, with explicit references to the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning on Style and Intellectual Excellence**\n\nThe text suggests that a ''pomp of language'' is not artificial but a reflection of a ''lofty intellect.'' Construct an argument that this view implies a direct relationship between intellectual excellence and rhetorical style.\n- **Step 1**: Define ''pomp of language'' and ''lofty intellect'' based on the text.\n- **Step 2**: Use logical reasoning to connect these two concepts, referencing Newman''s and Aristotle''s ideas.\n- **Step 3**: Provide a counterexample that challenges this relationship, and explain why it might not hold.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate both Newman''s and Aristotle''s viewpoints, with clear logical connections to the text.'

    You will say that Cicero's language is undeniably studied, but that Shakespeare's is as undeniably natural and spontaneous; and that this is what is meant, when the Classics are accused of being mere artists of words. Here we are introduced to a further large question, which gives me the opportunity of anticipating a misapprehension of my meaning. I observe, then, that not only is that lavish richness of style, which I have noticed in Shakespeare, justifiable on the principles which I have been laying down, but, what is less easy to receive, even elaborateness in composition is no mark of trick or artifice in an author. Undoubtedly the works of the Classics, particularly the Latin, are elaborate; they have cost a great deal of time, care, and trouble. They have had many rough copies; I grant it. I grant also that there are writers of name, ancient and modern, who really are guilty of the absurdity of making sentences, as the very end of their literary labour. Such was Isocrates; such were some of the sophists; they were set on words, to the neglect of thoughts or things; I cannot defend them. If I must give an English instance of this fault, much as I love and revere the personal character and intellectual vigor of Dr. Johnson, I cannot deny that his style often outruns the sense and the occasion, and is wanting in that simplicity which is the attribute of genius. Still, granting all this, I cannot grant, notwithstanding, that genius never need take pains—that genius may not improve by practice—that it never finishes off at leisure what it has thrown off in the outline at a stroke.

    In this point of view, doubtless, many or most writers are elaborate; and those certainly not the least whose style is furthest removed from ornament, being simple and natural, or vehement, or severely business-like and practical. Who so energetic and manly as Demosthenes? Yet he is said to have transcribed Thucydides many times over in the formation of his style. Who so gracefully natural as Herodotus? yet his very dialect is not his own, but chosen for the sake of the perfection of his narrative. Who exhibits such happy negligence as our own Addison? yet artistic fastidiousness was so notorious in his instance that the report has got abroad, truly or not, that he was too late in his issue of an important state-paper, from his habit of revision and recomposition. Such great authors were working by a model which was before the eyes of their intellect, and they were labouring to say what they had to say, in such a way as would most exactly and suitably express it. It is not wonderful that other authors, whose style is not simple, should be instances of a similar literary diligence. Virgil wished his Aeneid to be burned, elaborate as is its composition, because he felt it needed more labour still, in order to make it perfect. The historian Gibbon in the last century is another instance in point. You must not suppose I am going to recommend his style for imitation, any more than his principles; but I refer to him as the example of a writer feeling the task which lay before him, feeling that he had to bring out into words for the comprehension of his readers a great and complicated scene, and wishing that those words should be adequate to his undertaking. I think he wrote the first chapter of his History three times over; it was not that he corrected or improved the first copy; but he put his first essay, and then his second, aside—he recast his matter, till he had hit the precise exhibition of it which he thought demanded by his subject.

    I shall then merely sum up what I have said, and come to a conclusion. Reverting, then, to my original question, what is the meaning of Letters, as contained, Gentlemen, in the designation of your Faculty, I have answered, that by Letters or Literature is meant the expression of thought in language, where by "thought" I mean the ideas, feelings, views, reasonings, and other operations of the human mind. And the Art of Letters is the method by which a speaker or writer brings out in words, worthy of his subject, and sufficient for his audience or readers, the thoughts which impress him. Literature, then, is of a personal character; it consists in the enunciations and teachings of those who have a right to speak as representatives of their kind, and in whose words their brethren find an interpretation of their own sentiments, a record of their own experience, and a suggestion for their own judgments. A great author, Gentlemen, is not one who merely has a copia verborum, whether in prose or verse, and can, as it were, turn on at his will any number of splendid phrases and swelling sentences; but he is one who has something to say and knows how to say it. I do not claim for him, as such, any great depth of thought, or breadth of view, or philosophy, or sagacity, or knowledge of human nature, or experience of human life, though these additional gifts he may have, and the more he has of them the greater he is; but I ascribe to him, as his characteristic gift, in a large sense the faculty of Expression. He is master of the two-fold Logos, the thought and the word, distinct but inseparable from each other. He may, if so be, elaborate his compositions, or he may pour out his improvisations, but in either case he has but one aim, which he keeps steadily before him, and is conscientious and single-minded in fulfilling. That aim is to give forth what he has within him; and from his very earnestness it comes to pass that, whatever be the splendour of his diction or the harmony of his periods, he has with him the charm of an incommunicable simplicity.

    low, he treats it suitably and for its own sake. If he is a poet, "nil molitur inepte." If he is an orator, then too he speaks, not only "distincté" and "splen- didé," but also "apté." His page is the lucid mirror of mind and life—

    "Quo fit, ut omnis
    Votiva pateat veluti descripta tabella

    He writes passionately, because he feels keenly; forcibly, because he con- ceives vividly; he sees too clearly to be vague; he is too serious to be otiose; he can analyze his subject, and therefore he is rich; he embraces it as a whole and in its parts, and therefore he is consistent; he has a firm hold of it, and therefore he is luminous. When his imagination wells up, it overflows in ornament; when his heart is touched, it thrills along his verse. He always has the right word for the right idea, and never a word too much. If he is brief, it is because few words suffice; when he is lavish of them, still each word has its mark, and aids, not embarrasses, the vigorous march of his elo- cution. He expresses what all feel, but all cannot say; and his sayings pass into proverbs among his people, and his phrases become household words and idioms of their daily speech, which is tesselated with the rich fragments of his language, as we see in foreign lands the marbles of Roman grandeur worked into the walls and pavements of modern palaces.

    I have been speaking of the authors of a literature, in their relation to the people and course of events to which they belong; but a prior consideration, at which I have already glanced, is their connection with the language itself, which has been their organ. If they are in great measure the creatures of their times, they are on the other hand in a far higher sense the creators of their language. It is indeed commonly called their mother tongue, but virtually it did not exist till they gave it life and form. All greater matters are carried on and perfected by a succession of individual minds; what is true in the history of thought and of action is true of language also. Certain masters of composition, as Shakespeare, Milton, and Pope, the writers of the Protestant Bible and Prayer Book, Hooker and Addison, Swift, Hume, and Goldsmith, have been the making of the English language; and as that language is a fact, so is the literature a fact, by which it is formed, and in which it lives. Men of great ability have taken it in hand, each in his own day, and have done for it what the master of a gymnasium does for the bodily frame. They have formed its limbs, and developed its strength; they have endowed it with vigour, exercised it in suppleness and dexterity, and taught it grace. They have made it rich, harmonious, various, and precise. They have furnished it with a variety of styles, which from their individuality may almost be called dialects, and are monuments both of the powers of the language and the genius of its cultivators.

Construct an argument that:\n- **Part A**: Proves that without literary works, the English language as we know it would not exist.\n- **Part B**: Disproves the counterclaim that language is a natural, unchanging entity by using examples from the text.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how this view of language as a ''fact'' shaped by literature relates to the role of authors like Pope and Addison.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be logically structured, reference the text''s claims directly, and demonstrate understanding of the interplay between literature and language.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving in Language Analysis**\n\nThe text describes language as a ''bodily frame'' that is ''formed and developed by individual minds.'' Using this metaphor, create a comparison between the English language and another ''organism'' that has evolved through human interaction.\n- **Part A**: Choose a metaphor for the English language (e.g., ''muscle,'' ''organism,'' or ''ecosystem'') and explain how it reflects the text''s view of language as shaped by literature.\n- **Part B**: Identify two characteristics of the metaphor that correspond to the ''limbs,'' ''strength,'' and ''styles'' mentioned in the text.\n- **Part C**: Explain how this metaphor supports the claim that ''language is a fact by which it is formed and in which it lives.''\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate the text''s language metaphor and demonstrate creative reasoning about how human interaction shapes linguistic evolution.'

    This is not a day for great writers, but for good writing, and a great deal of it. There never was a time when men wrote so much and so well, and that, without being of any great account themselves. While our literature in this day, especially the periodical, is rich and various, its language is elaborated to a perfection far beyond that of our Classics, by the jealous rivalry, the incessant practice, the mutual influence, of its many writers. In point of mere style, I suppose, many an article in the Times newspaper, or Edinburgh Review, is superior to a preface of Dryden's, or a Spectator, or a pamphlet of Swift's, or one of South's sermons. Our writers write so well that there is little to choose between them. What they lack is that individuality, that earnestness, most personal yet most unconscious of self, which is the greatest charm of an author. The very form of the compositions of the day suggests to us their main deficiency. They are anonymous.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Principles**\n\nUsing the text''s discussion of classical rhetoric, explain how the author''s assertion that ''our literature in this day... is rich and various'' aligns with the principles of ethos, pathos, and logos.\n- **Step 1**: Define each rhetorical device (ethos, pathos, logos) based on the text''s explanation.\n- **Step 2**: Identify specific evidence from the text that supports each device''s role in the author''s argument.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude with a synthesis of how these devices collectively enhance the author''s critique of modern literature.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate all three rhetorical devices and provide at least two textual examples from the passage to support your analysis.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Literary Style and Purpose**\n\nThe text contrasts the ''jealous rivalry'' of modern writers with the ''most unconscious of self'' of classical authors. Using this contrast,\n- **Part A**: Explain how the author''s use of the word ''anonymous'' reflects a critique of modern literary style.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the ''earnestness'' of classical authors with the ''individuality'' of modern writers, based on the text''s definitions.\n- **Part C**: Propose a hypothesis about why the author might believe that modern literature lacks ''individuality.'' Use logical reasoning based on the text''s discussion of rhetorical devices.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must reference at least two specific terms from the text and demonstrate a clear understanding of the author''s perspective on literary evolution.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Thinking on Rhetorical Deficiencies**\n\nThe author claims that ''there is little to choose between them'' in modern literature, but lacks ''individuality, that earnestness... which is the greatest charm of an author.''\n- **Part A**: Define ''individuality'' and ''earnestness'' using the text''s definitions.\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument that explains why ''individuality'' is considered the greatest charm of an author, referencing at least two examples from the text.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the author''s claim that modern literature ''lacks individuality'' by considering the role of rhetorical devices in contemporary writing.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate definitions from the text and provide a coherent argument that addresses both the author''s critique and its implications for modern literary style.'

    Alas! what are we doing all through life, both as a necessity and as a duty,
    but unlearning the world's poetry, and attaining to its prose! This is our edu-
    cation, as boys and as men, in the action of life, and in the closet or library;
    in our affections, in our aims, in our hopes, and in our memories. And in
    like manner it is the education of our intellect; I say, that one main portion
    of intellectual education, of the labours of both school and university, is to
    remove the original dimness of the mind's eye; to strengthen and perfect
    its vision; to enable it to look out into the world right forward, steadily and
    truly; to give the mind clearness, accuracy, precision; to enable it to use
    words aright, to understand what it says, to conceive justly what it thinks
    about, to abstract, compare, analyze, divide, define, and reason, correctly.
    There is a particular science which takes these matters in hand, and it is
    called logic; but it is not by logic, certainly not by logic alone, that the faculty
    I speak of is acquired. The infant does not learn to spell and read the hues
    upon his retina by any scientific rule; nor does the student learn accuracy
    of thought by any manual or treatise. The instruction given him, of what-
    ever kind, if it be really instruction, is mainly, or at least pre-eminently, this,
    —a discipline in accuracy of mind.

    All this will be best arrived at by trying how far he can frame a possible,
    or analyze a given, sentence. To translate an English sentence into Latin
    is to frame a sentence, and is the best test whether or not a student knows
    the difference of Latin from English construction; to construe and parse is
    to analyze a sentence, and is an evidence of the easier attainment of knowing
    what Latin construction is in itself. And this is the sense of the word "Gram.
    mar" which our inaccurate student detests, and this is the sense of the word

  finalExamQuestion2: 'Analysis of Grammar as a Discipline\n\nThe passage defines grammar as ''the sense of the word "Gram. mar" which our inaccurate student detests.'' How does this definition contrast with the traditional view of grammar as a set of rules for writing and speaking?\n- **Step 1**: Explain the traditional definition of grammar.\n- **Step 2**: Compare and contrast it with the passage''s definition using examples from the text.\n- **Step 3**: Discuss how this contrast illuminates a broader philosophical perspective on the purpose of education.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly distinguish between the two definitions and reflect on their implications for learning and intellectual development.'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Critical Thinking in Language Acquisition\n\nThe text states, ''The infant does not learn to spell and read the hues upon his retina by any scientific rule.'' How does this statement challenge common misconceptions about language acquisition?\n- **Step 1**: Identify the common misconception about how children learn language.\n- **Step 2**: Use the text''s argument to refute this misconception, citing specific examples from the passage.\n- **Step 3**: Extend this reasoning to a modern educational context, such as teaching second language acquisition.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an ability to analyze the text''s argument critically and apply it to contemporary educational practices.'

    Which every sensible tutor will maintain. His maxim is, "a little, but well";
    that is, really know what you say you know: know what you know and what
    you do not know; get one thing well before you go on to a second; try to
    ascertain what your words mean; when you read a sentence, picture it before
    your mind as a whole, take in the truth or information contained in it, ex-
    press it in your own words, and, if it be important, commit it to the faithful
    memory. Again, compare one idea with another; adjust truths and facts;
    form them into one whole, or notice the obstacles which occur in doing so.
    This is the way to make progress; this is the way to arrive at results; not to
    swallow knowledge, but (according to the figure sometimes used) to masti-
    cate and digest it.

    Study and meditation being imperative, can it be denied that one of the
    most effectual means by which we are able to ascertain our understanding
    of a subject, to bring out our thoughts upon it, to clear our meaning, to en-
    large our views of its relations to other subjects, and to develop it generally,
    is to write down carefully all we have to say about it? People indeed differ
    in matters of this kind, but I think that writing is a stimulus to the mental
    faculties, to the logical talent, to originality, to the power of illustration, to
    the arrangement of topics, second to none. Till a man begins to put down
    his thoughts about a subject on paper he will not ascertain what he knows
    and what he does not know; and still less will he be able to express what he
    does know.

    5 As Duffy used to say in the dear, dead days of radio: "Leave us face it."
    The American language, a comparatively youthful and obstreperous off-
    spring of English, is even more vigorous than its parent and (like many
    children today) even more confused. We are a nation that delights in mis-
    quoting the Chinese proverb that "one picture is worth a thousand words."
    Writing started with pictures, and it looks as if there is a real danger that
    we might revert. We don't read magazines any more; we look at pictures.
    We don't talk to each other any more; we watch pictures of other people
    talking to each other on television. When we get tired of television we don't
    read a book; we go to the cinema and look at pictures, bigger ones. Have
    you noticed that people no longer "give you the word"? Now they "put you
    in the picture."

    6 We can understand pictures fairly well now—even the complicated ana-
    tomical ones in the TV commercials—but we are no longer so good at using
    words.

    7 To make matters worse, America's highest-paid and most widely-pub-
    lished authors (I mean the advertising boys) are far more often determined
    to confuse you rather than tell you something clearly and simply. They
    bombard you with meaningless statistics, pseudo-scientific jargon, empty
    phrases studded with vague terms such as "additives" and "conditioners."
    They're taking the logic out of language. What's the "regular" size of soap?
    Why the one you don't regularly buy. (It's too small.) What's the "economy"
    size? The one that costs more.

    8 Advertising ballyhoo has made us all insensitive to superlatives. A Hollywood producer is asked about his latest picture: "How is it?" "It's colossal, magnificent," he replies, "but it's improving." A 21-inch TV screen is described as "huge." If it is, what's a g x 12' rug? (I must admit that even the advertising boys are embarrassed about calling a 21-inch screen "huge"—by the way, that's the diagonal measurement!—and now they give the area in square inches, relying on the fact that, if there's anything the American public knows less about than its native language, it's mathematics.)

    9 The politicians are adding to the confusion. "Nationalization" has become "public ownership." A "bust" has become "deflation," "retrenchment," or "downward readjustment." The word "free" has lost nearly all meaning, now that the "Free World" includes South Africa, Spain, and the vilest governments of South America. "Peace" has become a dirty word. Preparations for war are called "defense programmes." Hydrogen bombs are "thermonuclear deterrents"—which sounds as if they were protections against hydrogen bombs. We even have "clean" bombs. The Ultimate Detergent?

    10 The fact that more than a million young thugs are hauled before the courts every year doesn't sound nearly so bad if you'll call young criminals "juvenile delinquents." A "delinquent," by definition, hasn't done something. These kids have!

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Wordplay and Meaning Shifts**\n\nAnalyze the rhetorical strategy used in the text to redefine terms like "nationalization" and "peace."\n- **Step 1**: Identify the original meaning of each term (e.g., "nationalization" was once clearly defined, but now is used ambiguously).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the text uses these redefinitions to create a persuasive or manipulative effect, referencing specific examples from the text (e.g., "free" now includes South Africa and South America).\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this form of wordplay is effective in shaping public perception, using logical reasoning about the power of language.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of both the historical and modern meanings of these terms, as well as their rhetorical impact.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Definitions**\n\nExplain the paradox in the definition of "delinquent" provided in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Define what a "delinquent" is according to the text (e.g., "a delinquent has not done something").\n- **Step 2**: Identify the contradiction in this definition, using examples from the text (e.g., "These kids have!").\n- **Step 3**: Discuss how this rhetorical device is used to justify the treatment of "juvenile delinquents" in society, linking it to broader societal implications.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must clearly highlight the logical inconsistency and its rhetorical purpose.'

    blatant inaccuracy in more than orthography, and so little imagination that

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Observations**\n\nThe text critiques the use of vague language and weak logic in contemporary communication. Synthesize this critique by identifying three examples from the text that illustrate how poor language use reflects either ''plain dishonesty'' or ''mental incapacity.''\n- **Example 1**: The quote about Emery Jacobs and the term ''definitized''\n- **Example 2**: The Air Force''s use of ''slobility'' for Strategic Air Command\n- **Example 3**: The phrase ''nominal in name only'' used by Peter de Vries\n\n**Task**: For each example, explain how the misuse of language indicates a failure in logical reasoning or clear communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must directly reference the text''s examples and demonstrate an understanding of how flawed language reflects either dishonesty or mental incapacity.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Rhetorical Impact**\n\nThe text argues that poor language use has permeated various aspects of society, from political figures to college students. Analyze the rhetorical effect of the author''s use of examples in paragraphs 12 and 13.\n- **Part A**: Explain how the author''s choice of examples (e.g., the matchbook souvenir, the sign in New Rochelle) reinforces the critique of ''Stupidity Fallout.''\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast the examples from political figures (paragraph 12) with those from college students (paragraph 13). How does this contrast highlight the broader societal implications of weak logic and vague language?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate the examples from both paragraphs and demonstrate how they collectively support the author''s argument about the prevalence of poor communication.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nThe text discusses how weak logic and vague language have infected various aspects of modern communication. Create a hypothetical scenario where poor rhetoric leads to a significant real-world consequence, such as a political decision or a public misunderstanding.\n- **Part A**: Describe the scenario, ensuring it reflects the types of linguistic flaws mentioned in the text (e.g., vague terms, weak logic).\n- **Part B**: Explain how the scenario mirrors the author''s critique of ''Stupidity Fallout'' and why this outcome is a direct result of flawed communication.\n- **Part C**: Propose a solution that addresses the root cause of the problem, using concepts from classical rhetoric to improve clarity and logical reasoning in communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the text''s rhetorical critique and apply it to a realistic scenario with logical reasoning.'

    15 Some Americans, of course, write brilliantly, vividly, concretely, memorably. There are those who can say what they mean—and mean to say something. But there's a strange thing about our American civilization. (I believe we do have an American civilization, despite the charges of my European friends who claim that America is the only nation in the history of the world that has moved from barbarism to decadence without passing through civilization.) The strange thing here is that a number of Americans are called upon to speak when they have nothing to say—and they get up and say it!

    16 Pity the poor president—and my example is drawn from history, not the current administration—inarticulate by nature and by military training, largely ungrammatical and faced by a battery of reporters who fire questions—many of which should not be asked or cannot be answered—and expect replies then and there. In a press conference the chief executive cannot use any of these sensible replies, however appropriate: "I don't know," "I've never understood it," "They don't tell me these things," "That's a secret," "God only knows," "We don't know yet," etc. He has to say something. Moreover, he must begin now and go on until he thinks of something: he must start the mouth before the brain is engaged. He has to hem and haw and sound like a fool and know all the while that every inanity will be copied verbatim and reported in full in the New York Times. He cannot obey the first rule of communication: when you have nothing to say, say nothing. He goes on, "verbosing it up," stalling, stumbling, obfuscating, hiding behind words, embroidering with meaningless clichés, decorating any idea that may be there with a fringe of dangling modifiers.

    17 To quote from a press conference transcript would be too painful, but here are some remarks (from an ex tempore address at West Point, June 5, 1960) which demonstrates the effect the presidency can have on a man's prose:

    It is indeed, difficult, in the circumstances in which I find myself, to discover words that seem appropriate to the situation....

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the rhetorical strategy used in the passage to critique American political communication. Specifically, compare and contrast the author''s portrayal of a president''s press conference with the ''first rule of communication'' mentioned.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the rhetorical devices employed (e.g., hyperbole, irony) to highlight the tension between a president''s need to speak and their lack of preparation.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how the author uses historical context (the 1960 West Point address) to reinforce their argument about presidential inarticulacy.\n- **Step 3**: Justify the author''s claim that ''when you have nothing to say, say nothing'' by referencing specific examples from the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate rhetorical devices and historical context, demonstrating an understanding of the author''s critique of political rhetoric.'

    Now tonight we meet at a time of bewilderment. I don't like this term
    or the using of the term that we are living always in crisis. We are not.
    There is no nation in this world that dares at this moment to attack the
    United States, and they know it.

    But we wonder what is the outcome of every decent, proper gesture
    we make to those that live in the other camp. They live in a closed so-
    ciety, secrecy of intent—which we try to penetrate, and in my opinion
    properly, but we are certain of this: our problem is not only keeping
    ourselves strong, and by strong I don't mean merely militarily. I mean
    spiritually, intellectually, scientifically, economically and militarily; and
    then, we must make certain that all of those people who live with us,
    in the hope that those concepts of human dignity and freedom and liberty
    are going to prevail in the world, will always stand by our side in the
    determination that freedom and liberty will eventually triumph over
    tyranny.

    Dwight MacDonald, who quotes this speech as well as Oliver Jensen's bril-
    liant New Republic parody of Eisenhower delivering The Gettysburg Ad-
    dress (Parodies, Random House, 1960), is not certain which is funnier, fact
    or fiction.

    18 William H. Whyte, Jr. (Is Anybody Listening, Simon and Schuster,
    1957) tells us about the executives in business who have to speak when they
    have nothing to say (annual meetings) or don't wish to say anything
    accurate (retiring employees). He defines their diction on these occasions
    as reverse gobbledygook:

    Where the traditional jargon is multisyllabic, longwinded, and _ passive, it [reverse gobbledygook] is filled with short, terse words; its sen-
    tences are short and the construction of them so much more active than
    passive that exclamation marks are as frequent as periods. Heavy on per-
    sonification, homely analogies, and a rigid glossary of hard-hitting words,
    it lends a powerful straight-from-the-shoulder effect to ambiguity and
    equivocation.

    Whyte and the editors of Fortune studied 200 business speeches, identified
    the 60 most characteristic expressions, and constructed an hilarious com-
    posite address. Look it up in Mr. Whyte's book (pages 55-58). You'll vastly
    enjoy reading it—and, if some day you're stuck for something to say, you
    can always steal it and deliver it at a board meeting, business convention,
    Rotary club gathering, academic convocation, etc. They'll love it. But you
    must deliver it with a straight face, like the ship captain in the Conrad
    novel who tended to "enunciate platitudes, not with a desire to dazzle, but
    from honest conviction."

    19 Some people are deliberately hiding behind words or thinly veiling their
    meaning. Thus one British parliamentarian says that another "seldom de-
    viates into accuracy," so Churchill describes Attlee as "a sheep in sheep's
    clothing," so Sam Goldwyn says, "The best I can give you is a definite
    maybe" and John Foster Dulles at the Washington airport (on one of his
    infrequent visits to the United States) said to a reporter: "No comment.
    And don't quote that." Subtlety is commendable. But what about other
    motives for being unclear or devious? What about the undertakers who call
    themselves "morticians," the carpenters who are "construction consultants"
    when they are simply driving nails ("interfibrous friction fastener installa-
    tion")? Aren't things getting confused when a man employed to cut things
    out of TV scripts is called a "continuity acceptance man" instead of a "cen-
    sor"? Why is the garbage man ashamed of his work to the point where he
    calls himself a "sanitary engineer"? And what happens to people who really
    are sanitary engineers? Must every man who cleans toilets prettify it into
    "restroom attendant employment"? Must every Billy Goat Hill become
    Angora Heights? What's wrong with "rat-catchers" (now "rodent opera-
    tives") and "watchmen" ("surveillance personnel") ?

    20 This kind of elegant variation can lead to a man whose father was hanged as a horse thief explaining the death by saying that "my father was taking part in a public ceremony when the platform collapsed." (If the father were electrocuted one could make him sound like a deceased professor: "My father occupied the chair of Applied Electricity at a large institution in one of the western states.")

    2x It's only silly when pompous people talk about their "residences" instead of their homes and wear "suitings" and "shirtings" instead of suits and shirts, "creations" instead of dresses. But it may indicate a deep dishonesty when the Army purchases 2000 portable showers, for the use of laborers ("Missilemen Fourth Class"?) who spill rocket fuel on themselves, and calls them "Rocket Propellant Personnel Neutralizers."

    22 It's the same unwillingness to call a spade a spade that lies behind this next example, an extract from an imaginary lecture by an Army sergeant who is compelled to "gobbledygook it up" because he is ordered (and ashamed) to lecture 50 minutes on an ordinary whistle:

    Awright, you men! Now today we introduce the U.S. missile whistle, Model M-r1. This is a self-repeating, shoulder-strap, general personnel model issued to relevant ranks. It is lung-operated, reverberating-blast, and air-type cooled.

    The whistle itself proper weighs in the neighborhood of about an ounce and the attached chain (which you see attached) adds about another half an ounce or so to the overall weight. The whistle is divided up into two component related parts: these are the whistle-cylinder blowing assembly and the whistle-retaining chain assembly mechanism.

    At the blowing aperture there are two raised sections—the men in the back better stand up to see this—one on each side. They are called the upper-teeth guard lug and the lower-teeth guard lug, respectively.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Analysis**\n\nAnalyze the rhetorical strategy used in the passage where a soldier is forced to describe a simple whistle using overly complex terminology.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the rhetorical device (e.g., euphemism, hyperbole) and explain how it is used in the context of the soldier''s speech.\n- **Step 2**: Compare this with the example in the text where a man justifies his father''s death by redefining it as part of a public ceremony.\n- **Step 3**: Conclude by discussing the implications of this rhetorical strategy on communication and truth in bureaucratic or military contexts.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must connect the two examples through a shared theme of obfuscation and demonstrate an understanding of rhetorical devices in real-world scenarios.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Language Analysis**\n\nExamine the language used in the passage about the Army purchasing portable showers for laborers.\n- **Part A**: Identify three instances where language is used to obscure the true purpose or meaning of the term "Rocket Propellant Personnel Neutralizers."\n- **Part B**: Explain how this linguistic strategy reflects a broader trend in bureaucratic language as described in the text.\n- **Part C**: Construct an original example of bureaucratic jargon that obscures the true purpose of a government program, using at least two terms from the text (e.g., "gobbledygook", "residences").\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate comprehension of the text''s critique of bureaucratic language and show original creative problem-solving skills.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Devices**\n\nThe text contrasts two examples of obfuscation: one involving a soldier describing a whistle and another involving a man justifying his father''s death.\n- **Part A**: Compare the two examples by identifying the specific rhetorical devices used and how they serve similar purposes.\n- **Part B**: Using logical reasoning, explain why the author might have chosen these two examples to illustrate the same theme of obfuscation.\n- **Part C**: Create a third example of obfuscation in a different context (e.g., politics, education) that mirrors the pattern seen in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate the analysis of rhetorical devices and demonstrate an ability to apply logical reasoning to different real-world scenarios.'

    The opening from the blowing end into the main cylinder is termed
    the compressing blow channel. The remaining component part of the
    whistle is known as the chamber-cylinder operating assembly complex.
    That consists of the opening sound-emission slot, the cylinder-butt lock
    (onto which the whistle-retaining chain assembly part is attached on),
    and the cylinder-reverberating operating cork pellet device (which in this
    case is a common garden variety pea.)

    The "disassembly" procedure is pretty funny too. But that's for ordnance
    only and will not be included in the final examination. We'll finalize this
    example here. ("Finalize," you'll have noticed, means "we haven't finished
    with it but to hell with it.")

    23 Executives in the "Armed Forces" are prone to ape business. They, too,
    never begin anything—they "initiate action." They don't collect information
    —they "assemblize imponderables." Then they make these imponderables
    as ponderous as possible, "process" them, and "phase them in" with other
    "factors."

    24 My own experience (in the Royal Canadian Air Force, among the
    paragraph troopers at a chairborne headquarters) includes a Wing Com-
    mander who advised me, in writing, to "get behind this thing and lead."
    There are other good examples of the military mind at work (or not work-
    ing). Take my "opposite number" in the Navy when I was a staff officer
    at AFHQ. He belonged in the Navy, where he could use flags and helio-
    graphs to communicate, because he couldn't use prose. One day he tele-
    phoned me to say that he couldn't give me, over the 'phone, the information
    I needed. It was secret. It was still secret, to me, after I read his subsequent
    memorandum, which I quote in part:

    In the referenced period under review, brought to your liaison for the
    cross-fertilization of ideas in a recent telephonic communication with the
    undersigned, the following SECRET situation, uncommunicable thereby,

    Our sea/air strikes against the enemy realized a very real improvement in results relative to fighter forces and, while the reverse might obtain for the enemy, the steady rise in blanket cover of the opposing fighter effort (as disclosed by the figures in Appendix "A") is not materially altered when due allowance is made for this possibility.

    This shows what can happen when you stop using human intelligence and start using military intelligence. It's the sort of thing that creates the "climate" in which a high-ranking officer can put this "minute" (the official term for a jotting in a margin) on a junior officer's "dossier":

    Flight Lieutenant A is not recommended for this liaison duty as I consider him inexperienced. He has little Air Force experience and no naval.

    Add jargon to gobbledygook and the result is horrendous. The officer who barks in trenchant monosyllables writes like this:

    We have locked on to operationally significant quantities of practicable equipment to zero in on optimum capabilities if the aforementioned philosophy materializes. Conceptual imponderables will be minimized by programming on the mach so as to firm it up and cream it off.

    That's swashbuckling prose that buckles where it ought to swash! The deleterious effect of advertising jargon is apparent. Advertising jargon! I can just see General George Washington showing Betsy Ross's new American flag to the Continental Congress. "I'm just talking off the top of my head, of course," he says, "but what do you fellows say we run it up the pole and see if anybody salutes it?"

    25 Advertising men and promotion men and public relations men! The PR people will soon make their "undertaker accounts" acceptable. I can see the black-bordered signs around the city: DIG WE MUST FOR A GREATER NEW YORK. The copywriters will begin to peddle "the only coffins with a lifetime guarantee." Supraliminally, liminally, and subliminally we'll be sold death. "Death: It's Only Nature's Way of Telling You To Slow Down." "Why not? Everybody's doing it." "Eventually—Why Not Now?"

    Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must be taken into account.

    That's torturous, but it does mean something, and it does say it, if only "as in a glass, darkly." But what about the bad writers who have nothing to say? And what about the professors of education (always the laughing-stocks of any faculty) who have something to say but are immensely embarrassed because it's so simple a child could understand it (or have thought it up)? The typical education course, I sometimes think, starts with nothing and is continually taking up class time with review. Most of these education experts are renowned for their intolerable lectures and unreadable textbooks and so incompetent, indeed, that even the other pendants notice it. (Of course not all professors of education are laughable. You can easily identify the sensible ones: they occasionally speak hesitantly in favor of a little less "methodology" and a modicum of "subject-matter content," and they call themselves "teachers." The others call themselves "educators" or even "educationalists." Some are disguised as psychologists, student advisers, and so on, but they aren't fooling anybody.)

    30 In the soft (or "social") sciences the writers most ridiculed (not always most deservedly) are the sociologists, so I suppose we'd better have a sample of their language. The story of the Good Samaritan. Brace yourselves, for such people are literate only in clichés.

    And behold, a certain Socialite stood up and tempted Him, saying,

    "A certain fellow travelling down from Aix to Ghent fell among traditionalists, who stripped him of his pretense, offended him, and departed, leaving him half mortified. And by chance there came down a certain realist that way: and, looking upon him as an out-group, he passed him by on the other side. And likewise an idealist, when he was at the place and also looked upon him as an out-group, he passed him by on the other side. But a certain man with a rounded personality, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he adjusted himself to the social situation. And he went to him and took him to an inn and associated with him. Now which of these three, thinkest thou, was in-grouped with him who fell upon hard times?"

    And he said, "He that acted democratically towards him." Then He said unto him: "Go, and adjust thyself."

    No wonder there's a rumor going around that sociologists are defining orgy as "sexual educational group dynamics."

    3x1 Our college students see enough bad writing in the newspapers they read (if any) and in the pretentious as well as the shoddier magazines. They shouldn't find it in the textbooks we force them to buy and read in college. There's an ever-present danger that if they don't fall into one trap (impairing their minds by aping the slangy and inexact dialect of the common man) they may fall into another and plump for padded pedantry.
    32 It's all right to write like Henry James if you're struggling with something subtle and involved, for even Henry James was doing his best to present the complexities lucidly and not consciously attempting to compound the difficulty, but it's pompous foolishness to take a phrase like "there was mob rule at this time" or "you can't concentrate when you are distracted" or "small business is failing in Utica" and make it utterly incomprehensible. There's something radically wrong when a great university cannot turn out a readable catalogue of courses, when students cannot read their psychology textbooks on "the learning process," when professional writers cannot use our language to produce simple income-tax instructions.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of In-Group Dynamics in Sociological Context**\n\nBased on the passage, identify which of the three characters (traditionalist, realist, idealist, or the man with a rounded personality) is most accurately described as ''in-grouped'' with the fellow who fell among traditionalists.\n- **Step 1**: Analyze the narrative to determine which character actively engaged with the fellow in need.\n- **Step 2**: Use the definition of ''in-group'' provided implicitly in the passage to justify your answer.\n- **Step 3**: Compare the actions of each character (traditionalist, realist, idealist) to the man with a rounded personality.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly differentiate between ''in-group'' and ''out-group'' based on the text''s implicit definition, and explicitly reference at least two examples from the passage to support your reasoning.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Reasoning on Sociological Definitions**\n\nThe passage mentions a rumor that sociologists are defining an orgy as ''sexual educational group dynamics.'' How does this definition align with or contradict the concept of an ''in-group'' as described in the passage?\n- **Step 1**: Define ''in-group'' based on the text''s narrative and sociological context.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze how ''sexual educational group dynamics'' might relate to the concept of an in-group.\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate whether this definition is consistent with the text''s portrayal of in-group behavior.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of both the passage''s narrative and sociological definitions, and provide a logical argument about how the two concepts might intersect or diverge.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Rhetorical Analysis**\n\nThe passage criticizes the use of ''padded pedantry'' in academic writing. Create a hypothetical scenario where a student is required to write an essay using the same kind of excessive language as found in the text''s examples (e.g., ''mob rule at this time'' or ''small business is failing in Utica'').\n- **Step 1**: Reproduce a paragraph that mimics the text''s style of overly complex or pretentious language.\n- **Step 2**: Analyze the scenario in terms of ''in-group'' and ''out-group'' dynamics as described in the passage.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this kind of writing could be seen as ''out-group'' in the academic context.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of both rhetorical style and the text''s critique of excessive language, with a clear connection to the concepts of in-group and out-group.'

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Devices in Academic Writing**\n\nAnalyze the passage from Corbett''s text and identify three rhetorical devices used to argue against the inclusion of certain topics in college curricula. For each device, explain how it contributes to the author''s argument and provide an example from the text.\n- **Example 1**: The use of hyperbole in the phrase "give us freedom from that sort of baleful influence" emphasizes the severity of the author''s concern.\n- **Example 2**: The metaphor "maturation of the striving for the higher echelons of excellence" suggests that certain curricula hinder academic growth.\n- **Example 3**: The anaphora in the repetition of "we can educate..." demonstrates a call to collective action.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must explicitly identify the rhetorical devices and their impact on the author''s argument, with clear textual examples.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Critical Evaluation of Educational Philosophy**\n\nEvaluate the author''s stance on college education based on the passage. Compare and contrast the author''s view with a traditional educational philosophy (e.g., Socratic method or Montessori).\n- **Part A**: Summarize the author''s main argument regarding the purpose of education.\n- **Part B**: Identify one traditional educational philosophy that aligns with the author''s perspective and explain how it supports the argument.\n- **Part C**: Critique one aspect of the author''s philosophy using logical reasoning, citing a potential drawback or limitation.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate a clear understanding of the author''s philosophy and its implications for education, with references to specific claims in the text.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Rhetorical Techniques for Persuasion**\n\nCreate a short argument (3-4 sentences) that persuades a university administrator to remove a controversial course from the curriculum. Use at least two rhetorical devices from Corbett''s text and explain how they effectively support your argument.\n- **Example**: "We can educate your sons and daughters in their native language..." (from the text) can be used to highlight the importance of clear, effective communication in education.\n- **Example**: The metaphor "a channel for communication..." can be used to argue that certain courses are not essential for academic development.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must incorporate the specified rhetorical devices and clearly demonstrate their persuasive power in the context of college education.\n'

    35 I try to teach my students to make all sentences as long as they have
    to be and as short as they can be. I tell them to bundle their ideas into
    packages worth carrying and, at the same time, light enough to be lifted.
    I tell them to write with distinction if they can—but with distinctness, at
    any rate. Clarity covers a multitude of sins. A good style may be dramatic
    and beautifully rhythmic and nicely balanced and euphonious—but above
    all it is clear, concise, concrete. I encourage them to be as adventurous in
    their expression as in their ideas—but sound.

    36 I invite you as parents to assist in the home, to set an example and
    teach your children to speak simply, to think clearly, to write logically.
    Improve their manner of expression: teach them honest English and you
    will be giving them a great legacy, one that will gain them acceptance in
    college or professional schools or in life.

    37 I invite (exhort) you as executives and administrators and people who
    deal in communication to speak and write simply yourself. Astound your
    colleagues. Don't begin letters with "Yours of the 16th inst. received and
    contents duly noted and beg to state...." Get to the point. Resolve that the
    next dozen letters you write will be only 50 words long each—and watch
    the results. Build the vocabulary you need—and begin by throwing away all
    the words you now have that are bent, broken, or worn out. Use what's left
    (supplemented by new words if necessary) to say honestly and straight-
    forwardly exactly what you mean, to inform rather than to impress or con-
    fuse. The ability to handle that vocabulary (and the ideas it represents and
    contains) is your greatest asset in handling your important jobs, your associ-
    ates, and your lives.

    The history of classical rhetoric covers more than two thousand years, from
    the fifth century B.C. until the first quarter of the nineteenth century. During
    most of that time, rhetoric was a prominent, and for long stretches the
    dominant, discipline in the schools, and some of the most famous men in
    history were involved in either the teaching or the practice of rhetoric. In
    view of this long and honorable tradition, it is presumptuous of anyone to
    think that he could present a satisfactory, not to speak of an adequate, sur-
    vey of rhetoric in a few dozen pages. The article that R. C. Jebb wrote for
    the Ninth Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica was devoted almost
    entirely to Aristotle. Because of the formidableness of the task, most his-
    torians of rhetoric have sensibly confined themselves to a coverage of indi-
    vidual rhetoricians or to limited periods. The Bibliography appended to
    this survey directs the student's attention to some of the best of these limited
    histories. But to date, no one has attempted to write a history of rhetoric
    on the scale of George Saintsbury's History of Criticism and Literary Taste
    in Europe or even of René Wellek's more recent A History of Modern
    Criticism, 1750-1950.

    Despite the impossibility of presenting an adequate survey of rhetoric
    in a few pages, an attempt will be made here to introduce the student to
    at least some of the key figures and some of the significant developments
    in rhetoric. Occasionally, authors and rhetoric texts will be mentioned,
    not because of their enduring worth or influence, but because they were
    historically important (the first of a kind, for instance) or representative of
    an especially important type.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Traditions**\n\nGiven the historical context that rhetoric was once the dominant discipline in education, analyze how the emphasis on classical rhetoricians like Aristotle and Cicero reflects the broader goals of rhetorical education in ancient Greece and Rome.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the primary contributions of Aristotle and Cicero to classical rhetoric.\n- **Step 2**: Link these contributions to the educational aims of their respective civilizations.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why classical rhetoric remains significant in modern rhetorical studies despite its ancient origins.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate historical analysis with the text''s discussion of rhetoric''s long tradition and its enduring influence.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Periods**\n\nBased on the text''s description of the long and honorable tradition of rhetoric, trace the evolution of rhetorical theory from its classical roots to modern periods.\n- **Part A**: Outline the key developments in rhetoric during the classical period (e.g., Aristotle''s *Rhetoric*).\n- **Part B**: Explain how rhetorical practice changed during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, citing examples from the text.\n- **Part C**: Compare the role of rhetoric in the Enlightenment and modern periods, using the text''s discussion of historical importance.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate a clear chronological understanding of rhetorical history and reference specific examples from the text.'

    The "art" or "science" of any discipline is almost always formulated inductively from a study of the long-standing practice of that discipline. This is certainly true of all the verbal arts—grammar, logic, poetics, and rhetoric. In the case of these language arts, the codification of principles did not come until several centuries after the practice had become a conspicuous feature of a national culture. There is ample evidence in extant Greek literature that rhetoric, conceived of as persuasive oratory, figured prominently in Hellenic society many hundreds of years before the first handbook of rhetorical precepts was compiled. One has only to note the prominence of speeches and debates in the Homeric epics, in the plays of the Greek dramatists, in the histories of Herodotus and Thucydides, and in the philosophical treatises of Hesiod, to be convinced that persuasive discourse exerted a continuing influence upon the ancient Greeks almost from the dawn of their civilization.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Principles**\n\nUsing the principles of rhetoric discussed in the text, analyze how persuasive discourse functioned in ancient Greek society.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key roles of speeches and debates in Hellenic culture, as described in the text.\n- **Step 2**: Compare these roles to contemporary rhetorical practices, using examples from the text''s mention of Homeric epics, Greek dramatists, and historical works.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how the text''s argument about the long-standing practice of rhetoric before its codification supports the idea that rhetoric is an art rooted in tradition.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate historical examples and the text''s central thesis about the inductive nature of rhetorical practice.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Analysis**\n\nExplain how the text''s discussion of the evolution of rhetoric from practical practice to codified principles can inform modern rhetorical strategies.\n- **Part A**: Discuss the implications of rhetoric being a ''verbal art'' that developed inductively over centuries.\n- **Part B**: Analyze how the text''s reference to Homeric epics and Greek dramatists reflects the ongoing influence of persuasive discourse in shaping cultural identity.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate how the text''s argument about the codification of rhetorical principles challenges or supports the notion that rhetoric is an art form rather than a science.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate understanding of the text''s historical and philosophical context, with specific references to its discussion of rhetoric''s development.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nThe text states that rhetoric, as persuasive oratory, was prominent in Hellenic society long before the first handbook of rhetorical precepts. Using this claim, construct an argument about the relationship between practice and theory in rhetoric.\n- **Part A**: Define what it means for a discipline to be ''rooted in tradition'' based on the text''s discussion.\n- **Part B**: Provide a counterargument to the claim that ''rhetoric is purely a theoretical discipline.'' Use examples from the text''s mention of Homeric epics and historical works.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the text''s emphasis on inductive reasoning in the study of rhetoric aligns with or contradicts modern approaches to teaching rhetorical skills.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s central thesis with logical reasoning about the nature of rhetoric as both an art and a science.'

    Although the practice of an art antedates its codification, there comes a
    time when men feel the urge to derive a set of "rules" from the study of
    accepted practice. The art of rhetoric was first formulated, in Sicily, during
    the second quarter of the fifth century B.C. Corax of Syracuse is commonly
    designated as the first formulator of the art of rhetoric. Certain political and
    social changes taking place at the time prompted him to establish some
    system of rhetoric. When Thrasybulus, the tyrant of Syracuse, was deposed
    and a form of democracy established, the newly enfranchised citizens flooded
    the courts with litigations to recover property that had been confiscated
    during the reign of the despot. The "art" that Corax formulated was de-
    signed to help ordinary men plead their claims in court. Since, understand-
    ably enough, no documentary evidence was available to prove their claims,
    they had to rely on inferential reasoning and on the general topic of prob-
    ability (eikos) to establish their proprietary rights. Perhaps the chief con-
    tribution that Corax made to the art of rhetoric was the formula he proposed
    for the parts of a judicial speech—proem, narration, arguments (both
    confirmation and refutation), and peroration—the arrangement that becomes
    a staple of all later rhetorical theory.

    There are references in Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian to the
    part that Corax and his pupil Tisias played in formulating rhetorical theory,
    but none of their handbooks survive. All we know of Tisias from the
    scattered references to him is that his theory was concerned exclusively with
    the rhetoric of the courtroom, that he wrote some judicial speeches for others
    to deliver, and that he may have been one of the teachers of at least two of
    the Attic orators—Lysias and Isocrates.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Structure**\n\nBased on Corax''s formulation of the judicial speech structure—proem, narration, arguments (confirmation and refutation), and peroration—explain how this framework reflects the practical needs of the legal system in ancient Syracuse.\n- **Step 1**: Describe the function of each part of the speech (proem, narration, arguments, peroration).\n- **Step 2**: Relate each function to the context of property disputes during democracy.\n- **Step 3**: Justify how this structure ensures the logical presentation of claims without relying on documentary evidence.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the structure with the historical context and demonstrate understanding of its practical application in legal rhetoric.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Theory**\n\nExplain how the distinction between Corax''s courtroom rhetoric and the later theories of Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian reflects changes in the purpose and scope of rhetorical theory over time.\n- **Step 1**: Summarize Corax''s focus on judicial speech and its practical application.\n- **Step 2**: Compare this with the broader theories of Plato and Aristotle, which included oratory in various contexts (e.g., political, philosophical).\n- **Step 3**: Analyze how the shift from courtroom rhetoric to a more generalized rhetorical theory indicates evolving societal needs.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the historical development of rhetorical theory and its adaptation to different contexts.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Application of Rhetorical Elements**\n\nDesign a courtroom speech for an ancient Syracuse citizen disputing property rights, using the structure established by Corax.\n- **Step 1**: Construct a proem that introduces the claim and establishes credibility.\n- **Step 2**: Write a narration that recounts the events leading to the dispute, emphasizing the lack of documentary evidence.\n- **Step 3**: Develop arguments that include both confirmation and refutation of the opposing side''s claims.\n- **Step 4**: Conclude with a peroration that appeals to the jury''s sense of justice and fairness.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your speech must adhere strictly to Corax''s structure, incorporate logical reasoning based on the text, and demonstrate an understanding of how rhetoric influenced legal outcomes in ancient Syracuse.'

    If modern students have heard the name of Gorgias at all, it is probably
    in connection with the Platonic dialogue that bears his name. In the history
    of rhetoric, however, Gorgias of Leotini is notable, first of all, for having
    stirred up interest in oratorical theory and practice among the Athenians.
    As an ambassador from Sicily to Athens in 427 B.C., he dazzled the Athenians
    with the brilliance of his speech-making. Thereafter he was, for several
    years, the most successful teacher and practitioner of oratory in Athens.
    Although he was one of the first rhetoricians to recognize the persuasiveness
    of emotional appeals, he distinguished himself mainly by the attention he
    paid to the cultivation of an ornate style. He placed great emphasis on the
    value of figures of speech, especially antithesis and parallelism. All the later
    theoricians who concentrated on the cultivation of a highly literary style
    of address could, for the sake of convenience, be placed in the Gorgianic
    school, but it is unfair to blame Gorgias for all the excesses of those rhetoricians
    who were concerned more with the flowers of style than with the substance. If some of Gorgias' speeches had survived, we would be better
    able to judge just how much the gaudy, mannered style known in Renaissance England as "Euphuism" owed to his influence.

    Gorgias may well lay claim to being the first of the successful Sophists
    in Athens, but Isocrates competes with Aristotle for the title of the most
    influential of the Greek rhetoricians. Judging from the length of his reign
    as a renowned teacher of rhetoric (he lived to be 98 years old) and from
    the number of skillful orators who emerged from his school, it would prob-
    ably be safe to say that Isocrates was the most influential Greek rhetorician
    among his contemporaries. Aristotle, with his more philosophical treatise
    on rhetoric, wins the title for long-range influence.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Influences**\n\nGiven the historical context provided, construct a comparative analysis of Gorgias and Isocrates in terms of their contributions to Greek rhetoric. Your response should include:\n- A comparison of their pedagogical approaches (Gorgias emphasized ornate style, while Isocrates focused on... )\n- An evaluation of their lasting impact (Gorgias'' influence on Renaissance English rhetoric vs. Isocrates'' role in shaping... )\n- A conclusion that reflects on how their distinct approaches to rhetoric laid the foundation for later rhetorical traditions.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must integrate specific details from the text about their teachings and historical legacies, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of their respective contributions.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Theory**\n\nUsing the text''s description of Gorgias'' emphasis on antithesis and parallelism, compose a 10-sentence speech that exemplifies these rhetorical devices. Your task includes:\n- Introducing a topic using parallel structure (e.g., "In the world of...", "In the face of...")\n- Using antithesis to contrast opposing ideas (e.g., "For every... there is a...")\n- Concluding with a balanced statement that reflects the text''s emphasis on style and substance.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your speech must demonstrate mastery of the rhetorical devices described in the text and show an understanding of their purpose in persuasive communication.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Rhetorical Legacy**\n\nThe text suggests that Gorgias'' influence extended to Renaissance England''s ''Euphuism.'' Construct a logical argument defending or challenging this claim based on the text''s evidence. Your response should include:\n- An analysis of the text''s description of Gorgias'' ''gaudy, mannered style'' and its potential influence on Euphuism\n- A comparison of Gorgias'' teaching methods with the characteristics of Euphuism\n- A conclusion that reflects on whether Gorgias can be held responsible for the excesses of later rhetoricians.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must be based solely on the information provided in the text and demonstrate a deep understanding of the historical and rhetorical connections described.

    A word needs to be said here about the term Sophist, since it applies to
    men like Gorgias and Isocrates and since it figures in the views that Plato
    and Aristotle entertained toward the art of rhetoric. Among the Athenians
    of the fifth century b.c., the term Sophist carried no invidious connotations.
    It was a rather neutral term applied to professors who lectured on the "new
    learning" in literature, science, philosophy, and especially oratory. The
    Sophists set up small private schools and charged their pupils a fee for what
    amounted in many cases to tutoring. These schools eventually proved to be
    so lucrative that they attracted a number of charlatans into the teaching
    profession, and it was men like these who eventually gave Sophists an un-
    savory reputation and made "sophistry" a synonym for deceitful reasoning.

    But men like Isocrates were highly ethical, with noble ideals and unim-
    peachable standards of intellectual integrity. We have already mentioned
    538 § A SURVEY OF RHETORIC

    that he may have studied under Tisias, and there are hints in some of the
    early histories of rhetoric that he also studied under Gorgias and Socrates.
    He began his professional career as a logographos, the Greek term for a
    hired writer of courtroom speeches—a beginning that he later wanted to
    forget. About 392, he set up a school of oratory, and although he charged
    unusually high fees, he soon had more students than any other Sophists.

    Although some twenty-one discourses and nine letters of Isocrates have survived, the Art of Rhetoric that Isocrates is said to have compiled has been lost; hence we are forced to abstract his rhetorical theory from such autobiographical works as his Antidosis or his educational works like Against the Sophists. One of his major contributions to rhetoric was his development of an artistic prose style. He took the rather artificial style of Gorgias, tempered it, refined it, and made it an elegant vehicle for both written and spoken discourse. Whereas the structural units that Gorgias was most interested in were antithesis and parallelism, Isocrates, with his great interest in the rhythm of prose, centered his attention on the sonority of the periodic sentence—certainly one of Cicero's debts to him. His concept of the proper training for the ideal orator also had a marked influence on Cicero and Quintilian. He preached that the whole man must be brought to bear in the persuasive process, and so it behooved the aspiring orator to be broadly trained in the liberal arts and securely grounded in good moral habits. In all his discourses, he stressed the Greek ideals of freedom and autonomy, and perhaps as much as any other ancient humanist, he preached the value of the supreme Greek virtue, sophrosyne (that we may translate as "self-control," for want of a more adequate English equivalent).

    Despite the high ideals that Isocrates set for his pupils and the exemplary eloquence of his discourses, he did not succeed in allaying Plato's suspicions of rhetoric. We should look briefly at what Plato (through his spokesman Socrates) had to say about rhetoric, because all the derogatory things that men have said about this art down through the ages have their roots in Plato's strictures.

    Remarks about rhetoric are scattered through several of Plato's dialogues, but the two dialogues in which he concentrated his attacks were the Gorgias and the Phaedrus. Irony, in the very act of depreciating rhetoric, Plato shows himself to be a masterful rhetorician; and equally ironic is the fact that some of the charges he made against the Sophists (e.g. that they corrupted young people and accepted fees for their teaching) were indictments later made against Socrates—as we see in the Apology. Students who read The Republic are often shocked to find that Plato would exclude poets from his ideal commonwealth. Basically, Plato's objections to poets are the same as those he made against the teachers of rhetoric. For one thing, rhetoric could not be considered a true art because it did not rest on universal principles. Moreover, rhetoricians, like poets, were more interested in opinions, in appearances, even in lies, than in the transcendental truth that the philosopher sought. They made the "worse appear the better reason." They were mere enchanters of the soul, more interested in dazzling their audience than in instructing it. Rhetoric—to bring it down to its lowest terms—was a form of flattery, like cosmetics.

    Toward the end of the Phaedrus, Plato concedes the possibility of a true art of rhetoric. But it could be a true art only if the speaker made an effort to learn the truth about the subject he was going to talk about; if he would seek out essential definitions of key terms in his discourse; if he learned to make the proper divisions of his subject; and if he made an effort to fashion his speech to suit the nature of his audience. There are a lot of "if's" here, and it is apparent that Plato does not have much confidence that rhetoricians, in their great eagerness to please the ignorant multitudes, will devise and teach such a rhetoric.

    Certainly one of Aristotle's purposes in composing his Rhetoric was to
    counteract his former teacher's low estimate of the persuasive art. Even
    while he was still a pupil at Plato's Academy, he opened a school of rhetoric
    in competition with Isocrates. It is not known precisely when Aristotle first
    started to write his Rhetoric, but it is known that his treatise was not pub-
    lished until the second period of Aristotle's residence in Athens, sometime
    around 333 B.C. From internal evidence alone, we know that he completed
    his Poetics before he wrote Book Three of his Rhetoric. The late composi-
    tion of Book Three, which deals mainly with style and arrangement, may
    suggest that this book was an afterthought, a concession to the interest taken
    in style by the other schools of rhetoric. But we must remember that he
    devoted several chapters of his Poetics to a discussion of language and style,
    and it is believed that the Theodectea, one of his lost rhetorical works,
    treated in great detail the subject matter of Book Three of the Rhetoric.
    Nevertheless, it is true that Aristotle was not as much interested in style
    as he was in the invention of arguments. And it is this primary interest
    in invention that indicates how he sought to counteract the bad opinion
    that many of his contemporaries had of rhetoric.

    By concentrating in the first two books of his Rhetoric on the discovery
    of arguments, Aristotle sought to answer those who accused rhetoricians
    of being more concerned with words than with matter. And by abstracting
    first principles from the practice of oratory, he hoped to show that rhetoric
    was not, as Plato had accused it of being, a mere "knack," but was a true
    art, a teachable and systematic discipline that could guide men in adapting
    means to an end. With his philosophic treatise, Aristotle became the foun-
    tainhead of all later rhetorical theory. As Lane Cooper has said, "...the
    Rhetoric not only of Cicero and Quintilian, but of the Middle Ages, of the
    Renaissance, and of modern times, is, in its best elements, essentially Aris-
    totelian."

    Perhaps the key to understanding Aristotle's approach to rhetoric is the recognition that probability is the basis of the persuasive art. The orator often based his arguments on opinions, on what men believed to be true rather than on what was demonstrably and universally true. But whereas Plato found this to be a defect in the art, Aristotle saw it as a necessity. Discoverable, verifiable truth fell within the province of science or logic. But in dealing with contingent human affairs, men soon learned that universal truths were not always discoverable or verifiable. It was in this area that dialectic and rhetoric had a part to play. "Rhetoric is the counterpart of Dialectic," Aristotle said in the very first sentence of his Rhetoric. It is significant that the Greek word that Aristotle used for rhetorical proofs was pisteis, which has its roots in the word pistis, "belief." Belief, Aristotle perceived, is often the highest degree of certainty to which we can attain in dealing with the everyday affairs of men.

    This recognition of probability as the essence of the persuasive art lies behind most of Aristotle's contributions to rhetorical theory: the three modes of proof—the appeal to reason (logos), the appeal to emotion (pathos), the ethical appeal (éthos); the enthymeme as the rhetorical equivalent of the syllogism, the example as the rhetorical equivalent of logical induction; the topics as a system of discovering available arguments; his stress on the audience as the chief informing principle in persuasive discourse. Another of his contributions was the removal of the success-at-any-price emphasis that had brought rhetoric into bad repute. By stressing the notion of "the available means of persuasion in any given case," he emphasized the virtuosity of the effort rather than the success of the results. This stress also tended to make rhetoric a morally indifferent activity. Another of his unique contributions was his analysis, in Book Two, of the more common emotions or passions. One of the three modes of appeal that Aristotle explores is the emotional, and he was trying to show his students how to evoke the appropriate emotional response. This was the beginning, admittedly primitive but amazingly perceptive, of psychology.

    There is a great temptation to follow out all the ramifications of Aristotle's rhetorical theory, but this brief survey will not permit such an intriguing excursion. In fact, this textbook is so much indebted to Aristotle's theory that it can be regarded as a mere restatement, with some modifications and extensions, of the Rhetoric. So brilliant is Aristotle's treatise—it is certainly one of the great books of the Western world—that we can only regret the loss of the aforementioned Theodectea and of his history of rhetoric, Gryllus, named after Xenophon's son. For many years, the anonymous

    Rhetorica ad Alexandrum was thought to be another of Aristotle's rhetorical works. But scholars today are convinced that Aristotle is not the author of this sprawling work, and they are inclined to attribute it to Anaximenes of Lampsacus, an older contemporary of Aristotle. It was never an influential work in the history of rhetoric.

    Another Greek rhetorical treatise that deserves mention here is a text that has come to bear the English title On Style. The date and authorship of this work are uncertain. For a long time it was attributed to Demetrius Phalereus, who governed Athens from 317 to 307 B.C. and who was invited by Ptolemy Soter to help collect books for the great library at Alexandria. On the basis of internal and external evidence, however, W. Rhys Roberts, who has made an English translation of On Style for the Cambridge University Press, concludes that Demetrius Phalereus did not write this text, that it was written sometime in the first century B.C. or the first century A.D. This text, which deals exclusively with the elocutio (style) division of rhetoric, is notable for being one of the first to analyze the "kinds" of style. Whereas most later rhetorics discussed only three styles (the elevated or high style; the elegant or middle style; and the plain or low style), the author of this text discusses a fourth type, the forcible style. Throughout his discussion of style, the author is interested particularly in the choice and arrangement of words.

    Until the end of the fifteenth century, the Rhetorica Ad Herennium was
    thought to have been written by Cicero. Whether Cornificius is the author
    of this text, as some modern scholars maintain, is still being debated, but
    the Ad Herennium, written probably between 86 and 82 B.C., has the dis-
    tinction of being the earliest extant Latin work on rhetoric and the earliest
    treatment of prose style in Latin. Furthermore, as Harry Caplan, who trans-
    lated the treatise for the Loeb Classical Library, points out, the Ad Heren-
    nium offers "the oldest extant division of the kinds of style into three and
    the oldest extant formal study of figures." It should also be pointed out
    that the treatise presents the most complete treatment of delivery and mem-
    ory that we have in any of the surviving classical rhetorics. Although vir-
    tually unknown in the ancient world, the Ad Herennium enjoyed wide
    currency in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Professor T. W. Baldwin
    reveals that it was the basic elementary text in the English grammar-school
    curriculum when rhetoric had its great revival during the Tudor Age.

    Although Cicero was not the author of the Ad Herennium, he has enough
    titles under his name to assure his place in the history of rhetoric. Among
    his minor rhetorical works, written between 84 and 45 B.C., are De In-
    ventione, De Optimo Genere Oratorum, Topica, and De Partitione Ora-
    toria. His major rhetorical works are the De Oratore, the Brutus, and the

    There is no room here for an exposition of any of these works, but some
    general word can be said about Cicero's contribution to rhetoric. Cicero
    was a skillful orator as well as an esteemed teacher of rhetoric; some literary
    historians hold that he gave more effective instruction by the example of
    his orations and epistles (rhetorica utens) than he did by his theoretical
    treatises (rhetorica docens). His works played a great part in mediating the
    controversy between the "Asiatics" (the exponents of the florid, highly
    manured style) and the "Atticists" (the exponents of the plain, neat, severe
    style). Cicero's chief contribution, however, is probably his extension of the
    scope of rhetoric. Unlike Aristotle, who held that rhetoric had no proper
    subject matter, Cicero felt that the perfect orator had to be conversant with
    many subjects. In order to invent his arguments, the perfect orator must
    have a command of a wide range of knowledge. Accordingly, under the
    Ciceronian system the study of rhetoric really became a liberal-arts course.
    This broadening of the scope of rhetoric helps to explain Cicero's appeal
    for the English and Continental Humanists when the study of rhetoric
    was revived during the Renaissance.

    A later rhetorician whose name is invariably coupled with Cicero's is M. Fabius Quintilianus. Born in Spain about a.p. 35, Quintilian eventually went to Rome, where after completing his education he became a successful pleader in the law courts. In time he acquired such a great reputation that Vespasian established a chair of rhetoric for him at Rome. The prestige of this imperial endowment made him the supreme authority on rhetoric even after his death, about a.p. 96. About the year 88, he retired from his teaching post to write his great work on the training of the orator, the Institutio Oratoria. Fragments of this work seem to have been available throughout the Middle Ages, but after a complete text was discovered in the monastery of St. Gall in 1416, the Institutes of Oratory steadily gained popularity and firmly established itself in the European educational network. Between about 1475 and 1600, more than one hundred editions of the Institutes were published.

    The twelve books of the Institutio Oratoria are divided as follows: Book I deals with the preliminary education necessary for a study of rhetoric. Book II defines the nature, aims, and scope of rhetoric. Books III-VII treat of oratory itself, with emphasis on the finding (inventio) and arranging (dispositio) of material. Books VIII-X treat of style (elocutio). Book XI deals with memory (memoria) and delivery (pronuntiatio). Book XII deals with the requirements for a perfect orator.

    As the subject matter of Book I might suggest, Quintilian, like Cicero, regarded the broadly educated man as the fittest candidate for a course in rhetoric. Quintilian, moreover, emphasized a qualification that earlier rhetoricians had hinted at but did not belabor. Having accepted Marcus Cato's

    The definition of the perfect orator as "a good man skilled in speaking" (vir bonus dicendi peritus), Quintilian insisted that in addition to being intellectually fortified for his office the orator must be trained to be a man of strong moral character. It was this insistence on the intellectual and moral training of the aspiring orator that made Cicero and Quintilian the two most potent classical influences on rhetorical education in England and America. The moral bias was especially important, because from the seventeenth through most of the nineteenth century the English and American school systems were dominated largely by clergymen.

    Although the influence of the Roman rhetoricians had become dominant by the first century B.C., a few Greek works exercised a significant influence on the development of rhetoric. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a Greek contemporary of Horace, taught rhetoric at Rome from 30 to 8 B.C. He wrote a monumental history and criticism of the great Attic orators and some minor rhetorical works which deal for the most part with a study of the style of such Greek luminaries as Plato, Thucydides, Herodotus, and Xenophon. But the work of his that influenced—or plagued—schoolboys was a work which bears the English title On the Arrangement of Words. Dionysius treated only one aspect of rhetorical style, the order of words. Although he realized that eloquent expression involves a due regard for arrangement and choice of words, he decided to confine himself to a study of arrangement because he felt that other rhetoricians had adequately dealt with the choice of words. Dionysius' particular contribution is that he made schoolboys aware of the inherent beauty of words and of the possibility of producing pleasing effects even with ordinary words if they were skillfully arranged.

    Hermogenes and Aphthonius did not exercise as much influence on their contemporaries as they did on European schoolboys of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Both of them published rhetorical texts entitled Progymnasmatá. The progymnasmata were the first writing exercises, the "themes," that schoolboys attempted after they had learned their elementary rhetorical precepts. In addition to supplying technical rules for the construction of these minor forms of composition, the texts provided illustrations of the dozen or so common forms. These texts were clearly in the tradition of "formulary rhetoric"—the kind of rhetoric that taught by models. The Progymnasmata by Hermogenes and Aphthonius went through an astounding number of editions, in both Greek and Latin versions.

    The mention of one more Greek text will end this survey of the more important classical rhetorics. This text is the famous On the Sublime by Longinus. Today, On the Sublime is for most students one of the cardinal documents of literary criticism. But one must not forget that this work was written by a rhetorician (earlier, about A.D. 260, he had written a now lost Art of Rhetoric) and that it has made a contribution to rhetoric as well as to literary criticism. "The object of the author," says W. Rhys Roberts, who has made one of the modern English translations of this treatise, "rather is to indicate broadly the essentials of a noble and impressive style." Three of the five sources of the sublime that Longinus discusses concern style: the appropriate use of figures of speech (chs. 16-29); nobility of diction (chs. 30-38); and dignity and elevation of word order (chs. 39-40). By making enthusiasm a respectable resource, Longinus encouraged the exploitation of emotional appeal in the persuasive process, and by insisting that sublimity was "the echo of a great soul," he abetted the moralistic trend in later rhetorical education.

    Under the aegis of Hadrian and the Antonines (a.p. 117-80), the teachers of
    rhetoric attained a prestige and an immunity that they were never to enjoy
    again. These second-century Sophists acquired their unsavory reputation be-
    cause they eventually abused their privileged office and adulterated their
    discipline. The object of the Sophists was to amaze an audience rather than
    persuade it. To effect this end, they encouraged all the flashy tricks of style
    and delivery. The schools of rhetoric during this period had two curricula:
    the "sophistic," which designated the academic study of rhetoric as an art;
    and the "political," which was concerned with the practical applications of
    the art. But because the "sophistic" school enjoyed greater prestige and higher
    emoluments, rhetoric took a turn that debased it.

    Under the influence of the second-century Sophistic, rhetoric in the Middle
    Ages ceased to be pursued primarily as a practical art and became rather a
    scholastic exercise guided by the compendia of such medieval rhetoricians
    at Cassiodorus, Capella, and Isidore. Grammar, logic, and rhetoric consti-
    tuted the trivium, the four-year undergraduate course of studies leading to
    the degree of bachelor of arts. Music, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy
    made up the quadrivium, the three-year graduate course that led to the degree
    of master of arts. Scholastic logic held a decidedly superior position in the
    trivium. The province of rhetoric became principally a study of the art of
    letter writing (ars dictaminis) and of preparing and delivering sermons
    (artes praedicandi). True, the students were exercised in two forms of scho-
    lastic declamation—suasoriae, discourses on some historical or legendary sub-
    ject, and controversiae, discourses on some classic legal question—but these
    declamations were conducted so much in the spirit of epideictic or ceremonial
    display that the product of such training was usually a glib, clever "enter-
    tainer" rather than a resourceful orator in command of all the available

    means of persuasion. Accordingly, the art of rhetoric stood still, if it actually
    did not retrogress, despite the prominent position that rhetoric held in the
    curriculum. As Richard McKeon has said in his essay "Rhetoric in the
    Middle Ages" (Speculum, 1942): "Yes, if rhetoric is defined in terms of a
    single subject matter—such as style, or literature, or discourse—it has no his-
    tory during the Middle Ages."

    Although St. Augustine (a.p. 353-430) is not chronologically of the Middle
    Ages, we might look at him as a representative figure in the development of
    rhetoric during the medieval period. Anyone who has read The Confessions
    knows that during the period of his "flaming youth" Augustine was a stu-
    dent of, and later a teacher of, the "pagan" rhetoric that derived largely from
    the second Sophistic of Rome. After his conversion, Augustine made a sig-
    nificant contribution to rhetoric in the Fourth Book of his De Doctrina
    Christiana (a.D. 426-27). Augustine was interested in rhetoric as a means of
    persuading Christians to lead a holy life. With that exclusive interest he can
    be said to have narrowed the province of rhetoric. But by rejecting the
    sophists' preoccupation with style and the other elements of display and by
    returning to the more comprehensive rhetoric of Cicero he can be said to
    have extended the province of rhetoric once again. He concentrated on
    Biblical texts and especially on the Epistles of that masterful rhetorical artist,
    St. Paul. Augustine's analyses of these texts, however, were concerned not
    so much with the "message" as with the rhetorical craftsmanship. Somewhat
    surprisingly, Augustine rejected Quintilian's notion that the rhetor must be
    a morally good man. He did not deny that a preacher's reputation for a vir-
    tuous life would have a persuasive effect on an audience, but he recognized
    that even a vicious preacher could induce his audience to follow Christ if he
    were skillful enough in the manipulation of his suasive resources.

    Augustine's rhetoric laid the groundwork for the rhetoric of the sermon, the branch of study known today as homiletics—a science that was to command a great deal of attention during, and for many years after, the Renaissance and the Reformation. None of the classical rhetoricians, of course, had discussed the art of preaching, but the foundations for such an art lay in the epideictic variety of rhetoric.

    Kenneth Burke, in his discussion of Augustine in The Rhetoric of Motives, pointed out that Augustine had noted the instructional function of rhetoric. Burke says that "once you treat instruction as an aim of rhetoric you introduce a principle that can widen the scope of rhetoric beyond persuasion. It is on the way to include also works on the theory and practice of exposition, description, communication in general." Following this lead, some modern students of rhetoric, like Donald C. Bryant, have seen the possibility of adapting classical rhetoric to cover at least two of the four forms of discourse—argumentation and exposition. As a matter of fact, there seems to be no reason why we could not develop a rhetoric of description and a rhetoric of narration too. As a case in point, Wayne C. Booth in his book The Rhetoric of Fiction (University of Chicago Press, 1961), has provided us with an excellent study of the rhetorical technique of non-didactic fiction.

    Some Continental Rhetoricians

    For the history of rhetoric on the European continent after the Middle Ages, we shall mention only a few Continental rhetoricians, confining our attention to the four or five who had a marked influence on the development of rhetoric in England.

    The most influential rhetorician was Erasmus. Although this illustrious scholar spent only five years in England (1509-14), he set the pattern for the English grammar-school curriculum and for rhetorical training in the schools. He happened to be in England just at the time Dean Colet was founding St. Paul's school, and at the request of Colet he prepared a number of textbooks. Among these were De Ratione Studi and De Duplici Copia Verborum ac Rerum. Originally published in 1512, both of these texts went into an astounding number of editions in subsequent years. (The De Copia, for instance, had at least 150 editions—only a few of those, it should be pointed out, issuing from presses in England.) The De Ratione Studi is more a treatise on pedagogy than a rhetoric, but it is of interest to students of rhetoric for its incidental remarks about the language arts. It was not by endless drilling in rules that students learned to write and speak well, Erasmus maintained, but by discriminating reading and much practice. Erasmus is one of the early enunciators of that sanest of all precepts about writing: "write, write, and again write." He also recommends the exercise of keeping a commonplace book; of paraphrasing poetry into prose, and vice versa; of rendering the same subject in two or more styles; of proving a proposition along several different lines of argument; and of construing from Latin into Greek.

    The De Copia, which became a widely used textbook of rhetoric in the Tudor schools, was designed to assist grammar-school students in acquiring elegance and variety of expression in Latin composition. This text was based on the traditional res-verba distinction (literally, the thing and words; more broadly, matter and form). The first book of De Copia showed the student how to use the schemes and tropes (elocutio) for the purpose of variation; the second book instructed the student in the use of topics (inventio) for the same purpose.

    The matter of copia became one of the major concerns of Tudor education. The Latin word copia meant literally "plenty, abundance"; in a more
    particular sense, the phrase copia dicendi or copia orationis meant "fullness
    of expression." One achieved this fullness of expression by accumulating a
    number of things to say on a subject and by being able to say the same thing
    in a variety of ways. So copia was partly a matter of fertile invention and
    partly a matter of stylistic resourcefulness. By way of illustrating copia, Eras-
    mus in Chapter 33 of Book One presents 150 variations of the sentence "Tuae
    literae me magnopere delectarunt" and 200 variations of "Semper dum vivam
    tul memiunero."

    The only other rhetorical work by Erasmus that we shall mention is his
    text on letter writing, Modus Conscribendi Epistolas, published in 1522. As
    we have seen, letter writing had been one of the favorite rhetorical exercises
    during the Middle Ages. During the Renaissance, it dropped to an inferior,
    but not insignificant, position in the curriculum. For Erasmus, letters be-
    came the first extended form of composition that the student wrote after he
    had mastered the fundamental rules of rhetoric. In that age which lacked our
    means of rapid communication and transportation, diplomatic and business
    affairs were promoted principally through letters. Accordingly, the man
    skilled in letter writing was as much sought after as the man skilled in
    oratory. And the number of letter writing manuals, both in Latin and in the
    vernacular, attests to the demand for this training in the sixteenth and seven-
    teenth centuries. Today we also cannot afford to neglect formal training in
    this form of written discourse. Letters—friendly letters, business letters, pro-
    motional letters, letters to the editor—are the major form of written discourse
    that many of us will be called upon to produce after we leave school. There
    is as much rhetoric involved in some kinds of letters (the "begging letter,"
    for instance) as there is in the most elaborate campaign oratory.

    Along with Erasmus, Juan Luis Vives (1492-1540) stands in the forefront of those Continental scholars who spent only a few years in England but exercised an influence on the English grammar school that endured for well over a century. Born in Spain (and, for that reason, sometimes called the "second Quintilian"), educated in Paris and Flanders, he was appointed by Cardinal Wolsey in 1523 to the Lectureship of Rhetoric at Oxford. King Henry VIII entrusted the education of his daughter Mary to the joint tutorship of Vives and Thomas Linacre. Vives became persona non grata when Henry VIII was seeking a divorce from his compatriot, Catherine of Aragon, and he left England, never to return, in 1528.

    Vives exercised an influence on English rhetoric, not so much from his textbooks as from his treatise on education, by which he helped to set the pattern of the rhetorical curriculum. Unlike Erasmus, Vives did not publish any rhetorical works during his sojourn in England, and none of his rhetoric texts that he later produced were widely used in the schools. Vives published the De Disciplinis, his major work on education, at Antwerp in 1531, three years after he left England. Three works on rhetoric followed soon after: Rhetoricae, stve De Ratione Dicendi, Libri Tres (Louvain, 1533); De Consultatione (Louvain, 1533), a short treatise on rhetoric that he had composed while he was teaching at Oxford; and De Conscribendis Epistolas (Basel, 1536), his contribution to the rhetoric of letter writing.

    The De Ratione Dicendi and the companion De Consultatione provided a
    rich mine of material for Ben Jonson when he composed his own rhetorical
    work Timber or Discoveries, and it is highly probable that Shakespeare too
    was exposed to these works in his grammar school. But an examination of
    the statutes of the various grammar schools of the period shows that where
    Erasmus's textbooks are frequently recommended for the curriculum, Vives's
    textbooks are seldom mentioned. In his monumental study of Tudor gram-
    mar schools, William Shakespere's Small Latine & Lesse Greeke, Professor
    T. W. Baldwin accounts for the pre-eminence of Erasmus on the ground that
    he was the true Renaissance champion, whereas men like Vives and Colet
    belonged to the Catholic Reformation rather than to the Renaissance. Vives
    and Colet, he maintained, were more interested in moral reform than in lit-
    erary polish.

    Three other Continental rhetoricians who had a noticeable influence on
    English rhetoric deserve brief mention here. The first of these is Petrus
    Mosellanus or, to use his family name, Pierre Schade (1493-1524), a German
    professor of Greek at Leipzig University. He published a rhetoric text en-
    titled Tabulae de Schematibus et Tropis Petri Mosellani. As early as 1530
    the boys at Eton were using Mosellanus's text in the sixth form, and during
    the first half of the sixteenth century Mosellanus became the standard author
    on elocutio in the English grammar schools.

    Philippus Melanchthon or Philip Schwarzerd (1497-1560), a professor of classics at Wittenberg and a close associate of Martin Luther, published three rhetoric texts: De Rhetorica Libri Tres (Wittenberg, 1519); Institutiones Rhetoricae (Hagenow, 1521); and Elementorum Rhetorices Libri Duo (Wit-tenberg, 1531). Whereas Mosellanus had concentrated on style, Melanchthon gave only a minimum treatment of the schemes and tropes, referring his readers, for a fuller treatment, to such rhetoricians as Cicero, Quintilian, Erasmus, and Mosellanus; he devoted most of his attention to imventio and dispositio. Melanchthon tended to relegate invention and arrangement to the province of logic, and by doing so, he laid the groundwork for the revolution that Ramus and Talaeus were to effect in rhetoric later on in the sixteenth century.

    Joannes Susenbrotus's Epitome Troporum ac Schematum (Zurich, 1540) was an amalgam of Mosellanus and Melanchthon. The Epitome, with its collection of 132 schemes and tropes, had a printing in England in 1562, and thereafter, for the remainder of the sixteenth century, it replaced Mosellanus as the standard grammar-school text for the figures and served as the model for the later vernacular treatments of these stylistic devices.

    All of the rhetorics mentioned so far in this survey were written in either Greek or Latin, and most of the compositions by English schoolboys up to the second decade of the sixteenth century were in Latin. With the Renaissance, which began in Italy, spread to France, and eventually made its influence felt in England through the apostleship of Humanists like Roger Asham, Sir John Cheke, and Sir Thomas Elyot, there came a revival of interest in the pagan literature produced by the classical authors. When Aldus, in 1503, published the works of the chief Greek rhetoricians, classical rhetoric was assured of its share of this renewed interest. The cause of rhetoric was further aided, as we have seen, by the direction that men like Erasmus and Vives gave to the curriculum of the English schools. It was not long before rhetoric became the dominant discipline in the Tudor grammar schools and universities.

    Although the rhetoric taught in the schools was basically Aristotelian, Aristotle's Rhetoric was never a prominent textbook. It was the Latin rhetoricians, especially Cicero, Quintilian, and the anonymous author of the Ad Herennium, who dominated the early teaching of rhetoric in the English schools. As the pride of the English people in the status and achievements of the nation grew, pride in their native language grew correspondingly, and it was natural that schoolmasters should begin to think of composing textbooks, and of getting their students to orate and write, in the vernacular.

    It is common to classify the vernacular rhetorics produced during the English Renaissance into three main groups: (1) the Traditionalists—those who taught a full-fledged rhetoric, with attention given to the five parts: invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery; (2) the Ramists—those who assigned invention and arrangement to the province of logic and allocated only style and delivery to rhetoric; (3) the Figurists—those whose primary, if not exclusive, interest centered on the study of the schemes and tropes.

    Actually, these three groups differ more in their pedagogical approaches than in their fundamental conception of the art of rhetoric. The Ramists, for instance, believed as strongly in the importance of invention and arrangement as the Traditionalists did, but they believed that these subjects were more properly studied under logic. The Ramists may not have considered as many schemes and tropes as the Figurists did, but many figures that the Figurists studied under the aspect of style, the Ramists studied in connection with the topics of invention. Even from the brief exposition of the vernacular textbooks that follows, the reader should be able to determine into which of these three groups the books fall.

    Leonard Cox, a schoolmaster at Reading, has the distinction of having written the first rhetoric textbook in English, Arte or Crafte of Rhetoryke (1530). It is perhaps appropriate that this first English rhetoric should be of the traditionalist school. F. J. Carpenter, in a modern edition of Cox's text, demonstrates quite convincingly that it was based upon, even partly translated from, the first book of Melanchthon's Institutiones Rhetoricae. Like Melanchthon, Cox was interested primarily in inventio.

    In 1550, Richard Sherry, a headmaster at Magdalen College School, published through J. Day's press *A Treatise of Schemes and Tropes*, which has sometimes been called "the second book on rhetoric in English." It can certainly lay claim to being the first English textbook on the schemes and tropes. Five years later, Sherry printed a Latin-English revision of the earlier text, changing the title to *A Treatise of the Figures of Grammar and Rhetorike* and treating about 120 figures. Sherry produced his text in the hope of capturing the grammar-school trade. But his hopes proved futile, for Mosellanus and Susenbrotus were at the time too firmly entrenched in the curriculum to be dislodged. "The Treatise of Schemes and Tropes had only one edition."

    Although the compilers of vernacular rhetorics found the competition with Latin texts disheartening, they continued to produce them, and although their texts did not at first replace the classical texts in the schools, English rhetorics eventually superseded the older texts, in sales if not in prestige.

    The first of the vernacular rhetorics to gain wide currency was Thomas Wilson's *The Arte of Rhetorique* (1553). G. H. Mair, who has published a handsome modern edition of this rhetoric, says of Wilson that he was one of the Cambridge men "who...did much to mould the course of the Renaissance in England on its pedagogic side and who had no inconsiderable influence on the development of English prose." Wilson's text is a "Ciceronian" rhetoric, in that it treats of the five parts, but as Russell H. Wagner, perhaps the chief modern authority on the *Rhetorique*, has pointed out, Wilson appropriated some of his rhetorical doctrines from Erasmus, Cox, and Sherry.

    The Arte of Rhetorique has the careful organization and schematic form that characterized the best of the classical and medieval texts. Book I considers such matters as the five elements of rhetoric ("Inuention, Disposition, Elocution, Memorie, Utteraunce"); the seven parts of an oration ("Enterance, Narration, Proposition, Division, Confirmation, Confutation, Conclusion"); the three kinds of oratory ("Demonstrative, Deliberative, Judiciall"); and, in connection with these three kinds of oratory, the matter of Invention.

    ENGLISH VERNACULAR RHETORICS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY 551

    Book II treats of Disposition and the Figures of Amplification. Book III deals mainly with Elocution (style) but gives also a summary treatment of Memory and Delivery. The chief appeal of the Rhetorigue stemmed from the fact that Wilson had collected a great mass of sound classical doctrine and stitched it all together with his own observations, expositions, and illustrations, in an appealing English prose style. For native Englishmen there was something appealing too in Wilson's strictures on what he called "strange inkhorn terms."

    Many vernacular rhetorics appeared in England from this point on, but the most popular were not necessarily the soundest rhetorics or the most venturesome ones. We will mention some representative texts of several kinds to show the vigor and variety of the rhetorical tradition in English schools (and later in American schools) up to about the end of the eighteenth century.

    The rhetoric of letter writing, originating in the Middle Ages and continuing with the popular treatises of Erasmus and Vives, received another impetus late in the sixteenth century with the publication of Angel Day's The English Secretorie (1586). Day discusses some thirty different kinds of letters under four main headings: demonstrative, deliberative, judicial, and familiar. In the second edition of 1592, Day added a section on the figures of speech and provided marginal glosses identifying the various tropes and figures in the illustrative letters.

    George Puttenham's The Arte of English Poesie (1589) is remembered by students of English literature as one of a group of Elizabethan treatises that attempted a defense of, or an apology for, poetry; but it also made a contribution to rhetorical theory. The third book of the Arte of English Poesie, with its elaborate treatment of figures, is operating in the tradition of Susenbrotus, Mosellanus, Erasmus, and Sherry. Puttenham made two contributions to English rhetoric: he invented vernacular names for the Greek and Latin figures, and, seeking a more rational basis for the classification of the figures, he decided to classify them according to the nature of their appeal. So we have the auricular, those figures which depend for their effect on alterations of "sound, accent, time" and therefore appeal primarily to the ear; the sensable, those figures which depend upon alterations of sense and therefore appeal primarily to the mind; the sententious, those that appeal both to the mind and to the ear. All in all, Puttenham treats 107 figures. George Saintsbury is not entirely right when he said of the Arte of English Poesie that it contained "the most elaborate treatment of rhetorical figures to be found, up to its time, in English literature," for Henry Peacham in his The Garden of Eloquence of 1577 distinguished 184 figures.

    Richard Rainolde's Foundacion of Rhetorike (1563) was an English adaptation of Hermogenes and Aphthonius's progymnasmata exercises that proved so popular in the early Tudor schools. Rainolde, in fact, considers the same fourteen types of elementary compositions that Aphthonius treated, with examples that Rainolde himself had supplied. Rainolde's hope of replacing Aphthonius was doomed to disappointment, since only one edition of his text was published, and that has approached so close to oblivion that only five copies of the original edition exist today.

    At this time, a revolution in rhetorical studies was effected by the French scholar, Peter Ramus. Dissatisfied with the repetitiveness and vagueness that prevailed in the teaching of the subjects of the trivium, Ramus distributed the traditional parts of rhetoric between logic and rhetoric. Inventio and dispositio—that is, the discovery and arrangement of matter—was assigned to the province of logic. Rhetoric had a franchise only on elocutio (style) and pronuntiatio (delivery). The fifth office of rhetoric, memoria—the memorization of the speech—Ramus simply ignored. Style would confine itself to a study of schemes and tropes, leaving to grammar the study of etymology and syntax. Ramus was working for a strict departmentalization of knowledge, for he felt that a great deal of the error and confusion that had sprung up in the arts was the result of scholars' mistaking the proper subject matter of the arts. Although the teaching of the two arts would be kept separate, logic and rhetoric in practice would combine and work together. As Karl Wallace has pointed out, the effect of this Ramistic dichotomy was that henceforth such processes as discovery, arrangement, and judgment tended to be assigned exclusively to the intellect, while the "dress" or "ornament" that style gave to matter fell to the lot of the imagination. We shall see later what Francis Bacon is to make of this division of labor between the reason and the imagination.

     bridge, in the spring of 1574, just about the time that Roland MacIlmaine was publishing in London the Latin text of Ramus' Dialecticae Libri Duo. Thereafter Talaeus and Ramus served as the model for the rhetoric and logic texts of Dudley Fenner (The Artes of Logike and Rethorike, 1584), Abraham Fraunce (The Lawiers Logike and The Arcadian Rhetorike, both in 1588), Charles Butler (Rameae Rhetoricae Libri Duo, 1597), and Thomas Farnaby (Index Rhetoricus, 1625; the fifteenth edition of this appeared as late as 1767). The appearance and success of these texts lend support to Professor Baldwin's contention that by the end of the sixteenth century the French-Calvinistic school of Ramus and Talaeus had scored a complete triumph over the German-Lutheran school of Melanchthon and Sturm.

    During the course of the seventeenth century, we find English criticism gradually making the passage from the broad Humanistic ideals of the Italian Renaissance to the more rationalistic, stringent attitudes of the French critics. Renaissance critics had drawn eclectically from classical, medieval, and contemporary theory. No one authority or system was accepted as final or all-inclusive. It was the French critics of the second half of the century who induced the English to write and judge by a single, settled canon of rules. Since most of the French criticism of the seventeenth century was concerned with the epic and drama (largely as a result of the importation of the neo-Aristotelianism of such sixteenth-century Italian critics as Scaliger, Castelvetro, and Robortello), poetics began to absorb more attention than rhetoric. Furthermore, the line of demarcation between poetics and rhetoric began to blur. Consequently, it is sometimes difficult to point to a seventeenth-century textbook and say with any finality, "This is a rhetoric book" or "This is a treatise on poetics." One is just as likely to find rhetorical theory in Spingarn's collection of seventeenth-century critical essays as in a textbook whose title explicitly designates it as a rhetoric book. Another result of the shift in emphasis is that fewer rhetoric books were produced in the seventeenth century than in the previous period, and none of those that were produced exercised the influence or enjoyed the popularity of some Renaissance texts.

    Besides the growing preoccupation with the rules, the seventeenth century exhibits some concern for the development of a simple, utilitarian style. The incipient interest in science—an interest created largely by Francis Bacon and fostered, after the close of the anti-science regime of the Puritans, by members of the Royal Society—encouraged the development of a "scientific" style.

- prompt: "Coupled with this growth of the scientific spirit was the reaction against  \n\"Ciceronianism,\" the movement that fostered the development of an ornate,  \nhighly mannered style by proposing Cicero as the principal, if not the sole,  \nmodel for imitation. Morris Croll and George Williamson (see Bibliog-  \nraphy) have traced out for us the counter development of the so-called  \n\"Senecan style,\" characterized by the relative brevity of the sentences, loosen-  \ness of structure, succinctness and pithiness of phrasing, and jerkiness of  \nrhythm. It was this movement that prepared the way for the development of  \nthe easy, colloquial style that graced so many eighteenth-century composi-  \ntions. As might be expected, the growing interest in the \"plain style\" resulted  \nin a diminishing concern for the schemes and tropes. But as we shall see in  \nthe discussion of the Royal Society's proposal for the development of a suit-  \nable expository style, John Dryden's development of an impressive \"middle  \nstyle\" prevented the development of a prose style that would be as severely  \nbarren and denotative as mathematical symbols.\n\nOur discussion of seventeenth-century rhetoric might well begin with  \nFrancis Bacon (1561-1626). Although Bacon wrote no systematic work on  \nrhetoric, there are scattered throughout his writings remarks and discourses  \nthat throw light not only on his own literary practice but on the direction  \nthat rhetorical theory was to take in the seventeenth century. The chief loci  \nfor Bacon's rhetorical theory are The Advancement of Learning and the  \nexpanded Latin translation of this work, De Augmentis Scientuarum. Com-  \nplementary material can be found in his Colours of Good and Evil and  \nApophthegms, New and Old. The best guide to Bacon's rhetorical theory is  \nKarl R. Wallace's Francis Bacon on Communication and Rhetoric (Univer-  \nsity of North Carolina Press, 1943).

    "The duty and office of Rhetoric," Bacon says in The Advancement of Learning, "is to apply Reason to Imagination for the better moving of the Will." In a later work, Bacon says, "Rhetoric is subservient to the imagination, as Logic is to the understanding; and the duty and office of Rhetoric. if it be deeply looked into, is no other than to apply and recommend the dictates of reason to imagination, in order to excite the appetite and will." By viewing the imagination and reason as definitely distinct faculties, Bacon lays the groundwork for the great amount of subsequent discussion about the separate provinces and the separate cultivation of these faculties; and of course he is thereby fostering the Ramistic dichotomy between logic and rhetoric.

    The view that imagination and reason were distinct and yet had to work together constituted the basis for Bacon's observations on style. Because he considered imagination subservient to reason, he advocated the precedence of res over verba. He took issue with the Renaissance school of rhetoric—the Ciceronians especially—that was more concerned with words than with matter. As a result of this preoccupation with style,

    men began to hunt more after words than matter; and more after the choiceness of the phrase, and the round clean composition of the sentence, and the sweet falling of the clauses, and the varying and illustration of their works with tropes and figures, than after the weight of matter, worth of subject, soundness of argument, life of invention, or depth of judgment.

    Although preferring res to verba, Bacon did not entirely neglect the matter of style. The three stylistic features that he concentrates on were the conformity of the style to the subject matter, the use of simple words, and the cultivation of "agreeableness." Bacon's insistence on the integral relationship between style and content is one expression of his revolt against the Cicero-nians, who tended to employ the copious style for all forms of address. Closely connected with this idea of style suiting the matter is Bacon's admonition that the style should be so adapted to the audience that "if a man should speak of the same thing to several persons, he should nevertheless use different words to each of them."

    One of the seventeenth-century rhetoricians obviously influenced by Baconian doctrines was the Roman Catholic lawyer Thomas Blount (1618-79). In 1654, Blount published The Academie of Eloquence. As Professor Hoyt Hudson has demonstrated, the first forty-eight pages of this 232-page book are copied, without acknowledgment, from Directions for Speech and Style, a little book produced earlier in the century by another lawyer, John Hoskins, but never published under his name until the 1930's. Blount was one of the first English rhetoricians to draw his illustrative material from contemporary English writers, such as Sir Philip Sidney, Ben Jonson, and Edmund Spenser.

    For Blount, the four virtues of style are brevity, perspicuity, "life" or wit, and "respect" or propriety. Note the premium that Blount placed on brevity (what other rhetoricians called conciseness). This emphasis and Blount's discussion of sententia and other figures connected with the "curt style" indicate that the Senecan manner was beginning to gain some attention. Blount was undoubtedly referring to the "pointed style" when he says in the section of the book dealing with commonplaces: "Eloquence is a way of speech prevailing over those whom we design it to prevail; That is, if we will take it in the short or Laconick way, a distilling our notions into a quintessence, or forming all our thoughts in a cone and smiting with the point." Blount treats of only twenty-five figures (for the most part, those treated by Talaeus in his Rhetorica) and devotes about thirty pages of his book to amplification.

    Blount's text concentrates on style, but it was style held under the tight check rein of the reason. In the thirty years after the original publication of his work, five editions appeared. George Williamson, who has given us one of the most valuable studies of seventeenth-century rhetoric in his book The Senecan Amble, attests that "no other rhetoric of that time seems to have been quite so popular."

    A number of rhetorics made use of the Scriptures. The most popular of these was The Mysteries of Rhetorique Unvail'd (1657) by John Smith, which defined rhetorical figures with special reference to the Scriptures; by 1709 nine editions of the work had appeared. With the ascendancy of the Puritans in the seventeenth century, rhetoric came more and more to serve as the tool of the sermon-writer and the expositor of the Scriptures. The subtitle of Centuria Sacra (1654) by Thomas Hall, a Puritan clergyman and schoolmaster at King's Norton, reveals the use to which rhetoric was being put during the Commonwealth period:

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Principles**\n\nBlount identifies four virtues of style: brevity, perspicuity, ''life'' or wit, and ''respect'' or propriety. Using Blount''s definition of brevity as ''conciseness,'' explain how the rhetorical figure of anaphora (repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses) can be both concise and effective.\n- **Step 1**: Define anaphora using the text''s context (e.g., reference Blount''s discussion of ''curt style'').\n- **Step 2**: Apply Blount''s concept of brevity to an example from literature (e.g., a famous speech or poetic work).\n- **Step 3**: Justify why this example demonstrates the dual nature of brevity as both concise and effective in rhetoric.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must explicitly reference Blount''s text and demonstrate understanding of how brevity can be both concise and effective in rhetorical style.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Figures**\n\nBlount''s work discusses ''sententia'' and the ''curt style,'' which are associated with the Senecan manner. Explain how these concepts relate to the rhetorical figure of ''parallelism'' (e.g., as seen in the structure of a famous speech or literary work).\n- **Part A**: Define ''sententia'' and the ''curt style'' using Blount''s definitions.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of parallelism from a historical or literary work and explain how it aligns with the Senecan influence on Blount''s ''curt style.''\n- **Part C**: Compare and contrast the use of parallelism in the ''curt style'' with its use in other rhetorical styles (e.g., elaborate or ornate styles).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate Blount''s definitions with examples from literature and demonstrate an understanding of the Senecan influence on his rhetorical principles.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Purposes**\n\nThe text mentions that rhetoric was increasingly used as a tool for the sermon-writer and expositor of the Scriptures during the Commonwealth period. Considering the role of rhetoric in religious contexts, answer the following:\n- **Part A**: Why might the Puritans have emphasized rhetoric as a tool for sermon-writing? Use Blount''s discussion of ''respect'' or propriety in style to support your argument.\n- **Part B**: Construct a counterexample to refute the claim that ''rhetoric is only effective in secular contexts.'' Your example must reference Blount''s text and a specific historical or literary work that demonstrates the effectiveness of rhetoric in religious contexts.\n- **Part C**: Explain how the use of rhetorical figures in religious sermons (e.g., as seen in Centuria Sacra) reflects the broader purpose of rhetoric in Blount''s text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate Blount''s analysis of rhetoric with examples from religious texts and demonstrate an understanding of the dual purpose of rhetoric in both secular and religious contexts.'

    John Prideaux, who was, successively, Rector of Exeter College, Oxford University, Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford, and Bishop of Rochester, published a rhetoric in 1659 entitled Sacred Eloquence: or, The Art of Rhetoric as It Is Laid Down in the Scriptures. The names of John Smith, John Prideaux, and Thomas Hall have all but passed into oblivion, and although John Smith's book alone of these three enjoyed a spurt of success, neither the popularity nor the influence of these Scriptural rhetorics was ever widespread or long-lived.

    One section of Thomas Hobbes's Answer to Davenant's Preface to Gongdiberst (1650), the section dealing with the "natural" style, has some pertinence to rhetoric and to the easy, colloquial style that Dryden was to "father" later in the century. True and natural expression is based, according to Hobbes, on two things, to know well and to know much. Hobbes goes on to examine the psychological effects of these two qualities:

    A signe of the first is perspicuity, property, and decency, which delight all sorts of men, either by instructing the ignorant or soothing the learned in their knowledge. A signe of the latter is novelty of expression, and pleaseth by excitation of the minde; for novelty causeth admiration, and admiration curiosity, which is a delightful appetite of knowledge.

    To know much was taken care of by inventio, that part of rhetoric concerned with finding things to say. The invention of matter, however, eventually had its effect on style when there developed a great interest in amplification.
    Copia resulted in that variety of expression which pleased because of its novelty and ingenuity. To know well was originally more the concern of logic

    than of rhetoric. But here too the quality of one's knowledge was seen to
    have some effect on style. Many rhetoricians, both before and after Hobbes,
    insisted that an idea could not be expressed clearly if it were not apprehended
    clearly.

    The natural style must also avoid words that are high-sounding but hollow
    (those "windy blisters") and phrases that express either "more than is per-
    fectly conceived, or perfect conception in fewer words than it requires." Since
    Hobbes's consistent aim is to chasten the exuberance of a kind of prose that
    had been fashionable, one is not surprised to find that he devotes little atten-
    tion to the figures and tropes. In general, his feeling is that while figures of
    speech add a certain grace and charm to writing they should be used spar-
    ingly and discreetly.

    Although Hobbes may seem bent on undermining the classical tradition,
    he was in fact thoroughly steeped in the classics. He wrote several of his
    works in Latin, translated Thucydides and Homer, and published a helpful
    digest of Aristotle's Rhetoric. In his efforts to bridle rampant fancy, he may
    be said to be operating under the great classical principle of moderation.
    With his rationalistic aesthetics he is laying the groundwork for the "tem-
    perate" prose of the neo-classical period and for the psychological approach
    that was to figure in eighteenth-century rhetoric and criticism.

    Another spur to the development of restrained prose was given by the
    activities of the Royal Society. In December 1664, two years after its found-
    ing, the Royal Society named a committee for the improvement of the Eng:
    lish language. Among those named to the committee were John Dryden,
    John Evelyn, Thomas Sprat, and Edmund Waller. Their hope was that the
    authority of the Royal Society would help to refine, augment, and fix the
    English language. Although this project never advanced much beyond the
    planning stage, the Royal Society was to have some influence on the kind of
    prose written in the neo-classical period. The encouragement that Bacon had
    given to the formation of a "scientific" prose was to be supported by the
    Royal Society and given a new impetus. One section of Thomas Sprat's His-
    tory of the Royal Society (1667) contains the manifesto of this reform.

    Many of the same ideas about the plain style as those advanced by Sprat were presented by John Wilkins (1614-72), one of the pillars of the Royal Society and later Bishop of Chester, in his Ecclesiastes (1646) and An Essay Towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language (1668). In the former essay he maintains that style should be "plain and natural, not being darkened with the affectation of Scholastical harshness, or Rhetorical flourishes." Obviously influenced by the doctrines of style in Seneca's Epistles, Wilkins recommends a style that follows a happy medium. Style, he says, "must be full without empty and needless Tautologies"; our expressions "should be so close, that they may not be obscure; and so plain, that they may not seem vain and tedious."

    The extreme to which the Royal Society's advocacy of a plain, utilitarian style could be pushed is discovered in Wilkins's Essay where he proposes "a Real universal Character, that should not signify words, but things and notions." In other words, a series of symbols would be established, each symbol having a univocal, universal, and constant meaning. Literary symbols would thus approach the precision and stability of mathematical symbols. Fortunately for literature, this project never crystallized. Instead of words with rich associations and many-leveled meanings, our literary vocabulary might have been made up of "useful," universal ideographs.

    Perhaps it was John Dryden, as much as anyone, who prevented the English language from taking that turn. Dryden preserved our language from taking on this mathematical character as much by his practice as by the rhetorical pronouncements scattered throughout his writings. He made propriety the central doctrine of his views on style. The propriety that Dryden called for is threefold: the language and style must fit "the occasion, the subject, and the persons." Closely allied to this concern for propriety is his discouragement of a "foreign" bias in our language. Dryden condemned Ben

    Jonson because "he did a little too much to Romanize our tongue." It is
    Dryden's move "to English" contemporary prose that has been largely re-
    sponsible for his reputation as the father of modern English prose style. His
    advocacy of native words and his encouragement of the use of vernacular,
    rather than Latinate, syntax are part of his program to refine the language
    and to attain more naturalness, more ease, more spontaneity in writing. And
    in his recognition of the "beauties" and the "spirits" of writing he is prepar-
    ing the way for the triumphant re-entry of the Longinian "transport" into
    the rhetorical criticism of the eighteenth century.

    The documents we have been considering over the last few pages have not
    been, strictly speaking, rhetoric texts at all. They reflect rather the intellectual
    currents that contributed to the development and to the eventual decay of the
    rhetorical tradition in the eighteenth century. In their preoccupation with
    style, these texts indicate how much the Ramistic program had caught on:
    the province of rhetoric seemed more and more to be restricted to style alone.
    But these documents also indicate how the groundwork was laid for the
    development of the kind of easy, natural, colloquial prose style that prevails
    today. The kind of prose style that is most admired today is not the Euphuis-
    tic prose of the Renaissance nor the Ciceronian prose of the nineteenth cen-
    tury but rather the plain but elegant prose found in such magazines as the
    New Yorker and the Reporter and exemplified in such writers as E. B.
    White, James Thurber, and George Orwell. And this kind of writing had
    its origin during the Restoration period with writers like Dryden, Bunyan,
    and Temple and its development during the Queen Anne period through
    writers like Defoe, Swift, and Addison.

    As we pass to the eighteenth century, we confront the last full century in which rhetoric, in all its classical complexion, occupied a prominent position in the academic programs of the schools. During at least the first half of the eighteenth century, the influence of French critics, especially of Boileau, Rapin, and Le Bossu, was even more dominant than it had been in the last half of the previous century. The lamentable feature of this adulation for classical precepts was the uncritical manner in which they were accepted as absolute, inviolable law.

    The questioning of Aristotelian and Horatian canons came with the appearance of editions and translations of Longinus. With the gradual emergence during this century of Longinus's On the Sublime, judgment came to be more a thing of taste and less a thing of rule. The new temper was

With the freer, more subjective type of criticism gradually claiming more and more adherents, the stage was being set for the appearance of the "romantic" writers.

    These shifts in the perspective of criticism were reflected in the rhetoric books of the period. The eighteenth-century rhetoricians still paid allegiance to the classical precepts, but at the same time they urged their pupils to strike out on their own, to discover a style that was natural to themselves, to submit to the dynamic force of enthusiasm. They no longer felt it necessary to classify, define, and illustrate multitudes of figures and tropes. Delivery, that aspect of rhetoric which had been so long neglected in the schools, began to receive attention again, largely as a result of the elocutionary programs of such mentors as Sheridan and Walker. Pulpit oratory continued to be asiduously cultivated, inspired by the elegant practice of such famous English preachers as Tillotson, Barrow, Atterbury, and of the even more famous French preachers, Bossuet, Bourdaloue, and Massillon. By the end of the century, collections of sermons sold on the scale of popular novels today.

    It can be said to the credit of eighteenth-century teachers that for the most part they regarded rhetoric as a practical art, much as Aristotle had conceived of it, rather than as a more speculative art. As in the seventeenth century, the line between poetics and rhetoric was hard to ascertain. Critics and rhetoricians drew on native belles-lettres for their illustrations. "In fact," George Saintsbury says, "Rhetoric, new dubbed as Eloquence, becomes the Art of Literature, or in other words Criticism." This merger of poetics and rhetoric helps to explain why the eighteenth century was the last great age of a serious academic interest in rhetoric.

    Lectures Concerning Oratory was published in 1758 by John Lawson (1712-59), a Master of Arts from Trinity College, Dublin, and the first librarian of the University library. Lawson's book is firmly based on Aristotle's Rhetoric and is pieced out by examples, mainly from Cicero and Quintilian. The first six lectures give a short history of classical and modern rhetoric. Lecture 7 presents "some thoughts concerning Imitation." The remaining lectures treat of eloquence in relation to reason (chs. 8-9), to passion (chs. 10-11), and to the senses (chs. 12-18). It is in the seven lectures devoted to eloquence and the senses that Lawson treats of style "as it comprehendeth Ornament, Composition, Figures."

    Lawson is a sensible, sometimes original, scholar, one who had absorbed a good deal of the learning of the past without closing his mind to the excellences of the present and the promises of the future. Following Aristotle as he did, he was deviating from the Longinian direction that criticism and rhetoric were taking in the eighteenth century. The encouragement Lawson gave to the cultivation of a simple, jargonless prose is remarkably akin to Jonathan Swift's pronouncements on style in A Letter to a Young Clergyman (1720).

    John Ward served as professor of rhetoric at Gresham College in London from 1720 until his death in 1758. In the year after his death there appeared a two-volume collection of lectures on rhetoric, A System of Oratory, that Harold Harding in his survey of eighteenth-century rhetoric has called "the most elaborate and detailed synthesis of Greek and Roman rhetorical theory published in English." Although his greatest debt is to Quintilian, Ward acknowledges early in the first volume that he has borrowed "the finest precepts of Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, Longinus, and other celebrated authors, with proper examples taken from the choicest parts of purest antiquity." The fifty-four lectures cover 863 pages—a bulk which indicates the thoroughness of the work but which helps to explain why it never became a widely used school text. Ward's text is, however, the only English rhetoric published in the eighteenth century which came anywhere near matching the comprehensiveness of Hugh Blair's Lectures on Rhetoric, a text that we shall discuss presently.

    Ward's chief preoccupation is with style. Exactly one half of the lectures are devoted to elocutio. The other parts of rhetoric receive adequate, but less thorough, treatment. Disposition rates eight lectures; six lectures treat invention; four lectures are spent on delivery; memory is the subject of only one lecture. The last eight lectures deal with imitation, the nature of the passions, the character of the orator, and a brief history of oratory. This collection of lectures shows how seriously and exhaustively rhetoric was still being taught as late as the mid-eighteenth century.

    We shall turn now to a consideration of two men who were most responsible in the eighteenth century for quickening an interest in pronuntiatio or the delivery aspect of rhetoric. The most successful of these speech teachers (he might be called the Dale Carnegie of the eighteenth century) was Thomas Sheridan, the father of the dramatist Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Sheridan's works fall into three categories: those dealing with (1) reading and speaking; (2) pronunciation; and (3) education.

    The most popular and probably the most representative of his printed
    works was Lectures on Elocution (1762). This book, which is a compilation
    of seven of his public lectures, deals exclusively with the problems of delivery
    —articulation, pronunciation, accent, emphasis, tone, pause, pitch, voice con-
    trol, and gesture. His Lectures on Reading (1775) gives directions for read-
    ing prose and for reading verse. Archbishop Whately, in his rhetoric text
    published in the nineteenth century, lauded and recommended Sheridan's
    system of marking passages to be read aloud. Sheridan's success as an actor
    lent great weight to his pronouncements on matters of delivery. He is the
    chief figure in the late-eighteenth century elocutionary movement which
    resulted in the shift of meaning of elocution from style to delivery and in the
    later vogue of the "elocution contest" in the schools.

    John Walker (1732-1807), the other eighteenth-century promoter of the
    art of delivery, was, like Sheridan, an Irish actor. In 1769, he gave up the
    dramatic stage, and after teaching for a time at Kensington Gravel-Pits
    School, he began a career of lecturing, at which he continued, with signal
    success, for the next thirty-five years.

    Walker's first appearance in print came in 1777 when he published The
    Exercises for Improvement in Elocution, which was nothing more than a
    collection of readings from select authors for those seeking to acquire the
    art of reading or speaking in public. Perhaps the best and most popular of
    Walker's works was Elements of Elocution (1781). This two-volume work
    covered such matters as rhetorical punctuation, voice inflections, gesture,
    accent, emphasis, and pronunciation. The similarity of this work with Sheri-
    dan's Lectures on Elocution is apparent.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Elocutionary Principles**\n\nCompare and contrast the approaches to public speaking outlined in the text by Sheridan and Walker. Your answer must integrate:\n- The purpose of each author''s work (e.g., Sheridan''s focus on delivery, Walker''s emphasis on public speaking practice)\n- The role of their backgrounds (actor vs. educator) in shaping their methodologies\n- The relationship between their texts and the broader elocutionary movement of the time\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the historical context and the distinct contributions of each author to elocutionary education.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Elocutionary Texts**\n\nExamine the following two excerpts from elocutionary texts and determine how each reflects the principles of effective delivery:\n1. "The art of elocution consists not only in the clear articulation of words, but also in the proper use of voice and gesture to express meaning." (From Sheridan''s Lectures on Elocution)\n2. "The Exercises for Improvement in Elocution... are designed to cultivate the art of reading and speaking in public through repeated practice of selected readings." (From Walker''s Exercises)\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Identify the key elements of effective delivery emphasized in each excerpt.\n- **Part B**: Explain how these elements align with the broader goals of the elocutionary movement as described in the text.\n- **Part C**: Propose a modern application of these principles to enhance public speaking skills in today''s context.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate critical analysis of the texts and their relevance to contemporary communication practices.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Elocutionary Concepts**\n\nThe text describes the shift in meaning of ''elocution'' from style to delivery and the rise of ''elocution contests'' in schools. Based on this, answer:\n- **Part A**: Why do you think the term ''elocution'' shifted from focusing on style to focusing on delivery? Use evidence from the text to support your reasoning.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the ''elocution contests'' in schools reflect the broader educational goals of the elocutionary movement.\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument that challenges the notion that ''elocution contests'' are solely for competitive purposes. Your argument must reference at least two elements from the texts (e.g., Sheridan''s emphasis on delivery, Walker''s focus on practice) to support your claim.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate historical analysis with logical reasoning based on the text''s content.'

    It should not be surprising that it was professional actors who gave a special impetus to a study of delivery, for all the spell-binding orators in history (men like Demosthenes, Churchill, William Jennings Bryan, Bishop Sheen, Billy Graham) have been, in a sense, great actors. Walker had the acting skill to qualify him as a teacher of delivery, but he lacked the grounding in the classics that Sheridan had and accordingly did not have the reserves to draw upon when it came to citing collaborative or illustrative material.

    The history of British rhetoric in the second half of the eighteenth century is dominated by three Scottish rhetoricians. With the great cultural renaissance that took place in Scotland after its union with England, Edinburgh soon came to be known as "the Athens of the North." During this period, in such fields as philosophy, aesthetics, psychology, history, economics, there are more eminent Scottish names than English names. And in rhetoric during this period, men like Kames, Campbell, and Blair had no serious rivals.

    Henry Home, Lord Kames (1696-1782), a Scottish jurist and psychologist, published in 1762 the three-volume Elements of Criticism, a work that was frequently reprinted and that exercised a marked influence on subsequent poetic and rhetorical theory. The scope of The Elements of Criticism is much broader than that of most texts considered in this survey. Kames's book, as a matter of fact, makes its major contribution to aesthetics. In that regard, it is of a piece with three other Scottish works—Francis Hutcheson's Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue (1725), David Hume's Of the Standard of Taste (1757), and Alexander Gerard's Essay on Taste (1758). Only a small part of Kames's book deals with rhetoric in the traditional sense of that word. His purpose, he tells us, is "to examine the sensitive branch of human nature, to trace the objects that are naturally agreeable, as well as those that are naturally disagreeable; and by these means to discover, if we can, what are the genuine principles of the fine arts." Kames hoped that by probing human psychology he could find an immutable standard of taste by which to assess all works of art.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical and Literary Evolution**\n\nGiven the historical context of British rhetoric in the 18th century and the role of Scottish rhetoricians, analyze how the development of rhetoric in this period reflects broader cultural and intellectual trends.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key historical events (e.g., Scottish cultural renaissance, union with England) that influenced this period''s rhetorical focus.\n- **Step 2**: Compare the contributions of Kames, Campbell, and Blair to the evolution of rhetorical theory.\n- **Step 3**: Draw a parallel between the philosophical foundations of rhetoric in this era and the expansion of fields like philosophy and aesthetics.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the interplay between historical context, literary figures, and intellectual movements as described in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Analysis of Rhetorical Theory and Its Foundations**\n\nExamine Kames''s *Elements of Criticism* in light of the text''s discussion of aesthetics and psychology.\n- **Part A**: Explain how Kames''s focus on the ''sensitive branch of human nature'' relates to his broader contribution to aesthetics.\n- **Part B**: Compare and contrast Kames''s approach with that of Hutcheson, Hume, and Gerard as mentioned in the text.\n- **Part C**: Justify why Kames''s work, while not primarily a rhetorical text, is considered significant in the history of rhetoric.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate Kames''s psychological and aesthetic theories with the broader context of 18th-century rhetorical development.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Rhetorical Contributions**\n\nEvaluate the role of Scottish rhetoricians in shaping modern rhetorical theory, using evidence from the text.\n- **Part A**: Discuss how the cultural renaissance in Scotland contributed to the prominence of Scottish rhetoricians.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the significance of Kames''s work in relation to the other Scottish contributions (Hutcheson, Hume, Gerard).\n- **Part C**: Construct an argument for why the study of rhetoric in this period is essential to understanding modern rhetorical practices.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must draw on specific examples and arguments from the text to support your evaluation of Scottish rhetorical contributions.'

- prompt: "Despite its undeniable influence on literature, Kames's Elements was never  \nwidely used in the schools. His book was bulky, involved, and written in a  \nrather ponderous style. Kames's influence was exercised indirectly, through  \nthe medium of those more popular Scottish rhetoricians whom he helped to  \nform. As Helen Randall, who wrote a full-length study of Kames's critical  \ntheory, says: \"If one may consider the direct influence of Blair as a secondary  \ninfluence of Kames, one may almost say that the textbooks on this subject for  \nabout a hundred years owed their main outline and many of their rules te  \nthe Elements of Criticism.\"  \n\n564 A SURVEY OF RHETORIC  \n\nThe second of the noted Scottish rhetoricians whom we are considering  \nwas George Campbell (1709-96). No less a critic than George Saintsbury  \nhas called Campbell's The Philosophy of Rhetoric (1776) \"the most impor-  \ntant treatise on the New Rhetoric that the eighteenth century produced.\"  \nCampbell was at once more readable than Lord Kames and more profound  \nthan the other member of this Scottish triumvirate, Dr. Hugh Blair.  \n\nWhat was Campbell's peculiar contribution to the art of rhetoric? For one  \nthing, he ventured the notion that rhetoric could have an end other than to  \npersuade. In the first two paragraphs of his treatise, he defines eloguence  \n(the term he prefers to rhetoric) as the \"art or talent by which the discourse  \nis adapted to its end,\" and he says that a speech may have any one of four  \nends: \"to enlighten the understanding, to please the imagination, to move  \nthe passions, or to influence the will.\" This is reminiscent of Cicero's notion  \nof the tripartite function of rhetoric: to teach (docere), to persuade (movere),  \nto delight (delectare). Reversing the notion advanced by Aristotle and his  \nfollowers that rhetoric was a mere offshoot of dialectic, Campbell proposed  \nthat logic be regarded merely as the tool of rhetoric. Campbell is perhaps  \nbest known to students of the English language as the one who proposed as  \nthe criterion of good usage the norm that locutions be reputable, national, and present.\n\nThe text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J.."
  finalExamQuestion1: 'Synthesis of Rhetorical Theories\n\nCompare and contrast the views of Lord Kames and George Campbell on the purpose of rhetoric, as presented in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify Kames''s primary focus on persuasion and his indirect influence on educational textbooks.\n- **Step 2**: Highlight Campbell''s argument that rhetoric can serve multiple ends beyond persuasion.\n- **Step 3**: Explain how Campbell''s definition of eloguence (as discourse adapted to its end) reflects a shift from Aristotle''s dialectic view.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must clearly distinguish their theoretical contributions and demonstrate an understanding of the historical context of their ideas.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: 'Application of Rhetorical Criteria\n\nUsing Campbell''s criterion of good usage (reputable, national, and present locutions), evaluate the phrase "speak with authority."\n- **Part A**: Determine if this phrase meets each of Campbell''s criteria.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the use of this phrase in modern English relates to the concept of ''national'' and ''present'' locutions.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to prove that not all commonly used phrases meet Campbell''s criteria.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must incorporate specific examples and demonstrate an understanding of the historical and linguistic context of the criteria.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: 'Logical Reasoning in Rhetorical Theory\n\nThe text mentions that Campbell reversed Aristotle''s view by placing logic as a tool of rhetoric rather than its counterpart.\n- **Part A**: Explain why Campbell''s approach to logic as a tool of rhetoric is considered a significant shift in rhetorical theory.\n- **Part B**: Construct an argument for or against the idea that rhetoric should be limited to its four defined ends (enlighten, please, move, influence).\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the claim that Kames''s influence was indirect and compare it to Campbell''s more direct contributions.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the historical context of rhetorical theory and demonstrate critical reasoning about the evolution of rhetorical thought.'

    Campbell's probing of the "philosophy" of rhetoric was so adventurous and original that his book exerted a fascination for students of rhetoric for many years after its original publication. More than twenty editions of The Philosophy of Rhetoric were demanded during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and it was regularly used in American colleges until about 1870. His book might have proved even more popular if it had not been for the formidable competition it received from one of the most widely reprinted rhetorics ever written, Hugh Blair's Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres.

    By 1783, when Blair published his book, he had been delivering lectures to the students at the University of Edinburgh for twenty-four years. It was in 1759, at the urging of Lord Kames, that he agreed to deliver, without salary, a series of lectures on rhetoric. This series was so enthusiastically received that a group of his friends proposed to George III that he establish an endowed Chair of Rhetoric at the University and that Blair be installed as the first holder of the post. The reputation of the celebrated preacher of St. Giles in Edinburgh was already so high that the English monarch had no hesitation about commissioning Blair in 1762 as the first Regius Professor of Rhetoric. Blair was finally prompted to publish his lectures because for years handwritten copies of them had circulated freely among enthusiastic students and had been boldly offered for sale in the bookshops.

    We shall probably never get an accurate count of the number of editions and reprints of Blair's Lectures, but by 1835 there were at least fifty editions. Later this text was translated into such languages as French, Italian, and Russian. It continued to be used in English and American schools until almost the end of the nineteenth century. William Charvat, a historian of American critical thought, has said that at one time Blair's Lectures was a text "which half the educated English-speaking world studied."

    Why was Blair's text such a popular rhetoric? One reason was the amaz-
    ing comprehensiveness of the forty-seven lectures in this one-volume text. In
    addition to the thirteen lectures devoted to belles-lettres, there were discus-
    sions of taste, beauty, and sublimity (three of the key terms in eighteenth-
    century criticism); a survey of philology and a review of classical and Eng-
    lish grammar; a detailed exposition of the principles of style, with special
    attention to the major figures of speech, and a detailed analysis of several
    pieces of prose composition; a history of oratory; and instructions for the
    composition of various kinds of speeches; discourses on poetry; and a com-
    pilation of the best classical and contemporary rhetorical doctrines. The
    marked religious tone of the Lectures also played a part in recommending
    Blair's text to schoolmasters. Blair's insistence that a man of eloquence must
    be a man of virtue became the warp upon which his lectures were woven.
    The mode and style of presentation also contributed to the popularity of the
    Lectures. Besides being clearly and systematically organized, the lectures
    were presented on an elementary level. Presuming in his students no pre-
    vious training in rhetoric, Blair took great pains to define his terms, to elabo-
    rate on what might strike us as commonplaces, and to supply whatever back-
    ground he deemed necessary for an understanding of the topic under
    discussion. As a result, Blair's Lectures could be used on several levels of the
    school curriculum.

    The history of English rhetoric might well terminate with the end of the
    eighteenth century, but it is customary to carry the history one step further
    to include Richard Whately's Elements of Rhetoric (1828). Whately was one
    of that brilliant group of Oxford reformers that gravitated to Oriel College
    in the 1820's. Eventually he was made Archbishop of Dublin. In 1826, with
    some help from John Henry Newman, he published his Elements of Logic,
    which had grown out of an article he wrote earlier for the Encyclopaedia
    Metropolitana.

- prompt: |-
    Whately's rhetoric has a strong Aristotelian flavor. Agreeing with Aristotle that rhetoric was "an offshoot of logic," Whately treated rhetoric as the art of "argumentative composition." His book is organized under four heads: (1) the appeal to the reason or understanding (this was the equivalent of Aristotle's logical proofs); (2) the appeal to the will (Aristotle's ethical and pathetic appeals); (3) style; (4) delivery. Among the notable features of Whately's Rhetoric were his elaboration of such Aristotelian concepts as sign, example, and probability, his brilliant analyses of argumentative fallacies, and his development of the function of presumption and burden of proof in the conduct of an argument.

    Throughout the first three-quarters of the nineteenth century, Campbell, Blair, and Whately were the three modern rhetoricians most often used in the English and American schools wherever rhetoric continued to be taught. Although Blair proved to be the most popular of this trio, modern teachers of rhetoric speak with most respect of Campbell and Whately. Neither of them was a particularly original thinker, but both of them based their rhetorics on sound principles of logic and psychology. If their texts had come somewhat earlier, the tenure of rhetoric in the schools might have been extended for several more years.

Donnelly produced for high-school and college students during the late  \n1920's and early 1930's retained something of the classical flavor, but by the  \ntime these books appeared, academic interest in traditional rhetoric had  \nreached a low-water mark. Rhetoric courses in the schools gradually assumed  \na new orientation—the study of the four forms of discourse: exposition, ar-  \ngumentation, description, and narration. The virtues that were stressed in  \nthis approach to composition were unity, coherence, and emphasis. Style con-  \ntinued to engage some attention, but the focus shifted from the schemes and  \ntropes to a concern for diction (which gradually deteriorated into a neurotic  \nconcern for \"correct usage\") and for syntax (which, under the influence of  \nthe popular handbooks, became a rather negative approach to \"correct gram-  \nmar\"). The study of the paragraph concentrated on the topic sentence and  \nthe various ways of developing the topic sentence to achieve maximum unity,  \ncoherence, and emphasis. The new rationale of the composition course is  \nmentioned not to disparage it but to point out how far the rhetoric courses in  \nour modern schools have departed from the kind of training in rhetoric that  \nwas provided by the texts reviewed in this survey.\n\nIt was the Speech Department at Cornell University that fostered the re-  \nsuscitation of classical rhetoric in our time.

    In which the students read and discussed Aristotle's Rhetoric, Cicero's De Oratore, and Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria. The effects of this classically oriented program began to be felt when graduates of Cornell's Speech Department took posts at universities in various parts of the country. The place to find articles on classical rhetoric during the '30's and '40's was not the journals directed to teachers of English but the Quarterly Journal of Speech and Speech Monographs. English teachers began to take notice when studies appeared of the rhetorical training of some of the great English writers—studies like T. W. Baldwin's William Shakespeare's Small Latine and Lesse Greeke, Donald L. Clark's John Milton at St. Paul's School, and Karl Wallace's Francis Bacon on Communication and Rhetoric. The renewed interest in classical rhetoric was given another boost by the vogue of Mortimer Adler's How to Read a Book and by the post-war popularity of the New Criticism, for both Adler and the New Critics were applying rhetorical techniques to the reading process. In recent years, a number of books and articles have appeared which subject some of the literary masterpieces to a rhetorical analysis.

    There has been sporadic talk during the last thirty years or so of a "new
    rhetoric." This "new rhetoric" is said to have profited by what it appropriated
    from the modern refinements in psychology, semantics, motivational re-
    search, and other behavioral sciences. Two of the names commonly men-
    tioned in connection with the "new rhetoric" are I. A. Richards and Kenneth
    Burke. The roots of Richards's interest in rhetoric can be found in the book
    on semantics that he wrote with C. K. Ogden in 1923, The Meaning of
    Meaning. In 1936 he published The Philosophy of Rhetoric. One of his pur-
    poses in this work was to point up the limitations of the rhetoric of persua-
    sion as it was taught by the ancients. To confine oneself to the persuasive
    aspect of language, he maintained, was to cut oneself off from some of the
    other uses of language. It was just because Bishop Whately had announced
    in his Elements of Criticism in 1828 that he was going to confine his study
    to "argumentative composition, generally and exclusively" that Richards
    chose him as the chief target of his strictures on the old rhetoric. George
    Campbell's The Philosophy of Rhetoric, with its concern for the psychology
    of the audience and its broadening of the function of rhetoric to include
    enlightening the understanding, pleasing the imagination, moving the pas-
    sions, and influencing the will, represented for Richards a more desirable
    model for a twentieth-century rhetoric. We can epitomize Richards's ap-
    proach to rhetoric by saying that he is interested mainly in how language
    in any kind of discourse works to produce understanding (or misunder-
    standing) in an audience. Something of this concern can be seen in the four
    terms he uses in his study of human utterances—sense, feeling, tone, and
    intention.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Theories**\n\nCompare and contrast the approaches of I. A. Richards and Kenneth Burke within the context of the "new rhetoric" as described in the text.\n- **Step 1**: Identify the key philosophical influences on Richards''s work (e.g., semantics, psychology).\n- **Step 2**: Explain how Burke''s contributions differ from Richards''s in terms of the scope and purpose of rhetoric.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why both theorists are considered foundational to the "new rhetoric" despite their differing emphases.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of the text''s characterization of Richards and Burke as pioneers of the modern rhetoric movement.  '
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nUsing the four terms Richards identifies—sense, feeling, tone, and intention—analyze a short passage from a modern political speech.\n- **Part A**: Extract the elements of sense, feeling, tone, and intention from the passage.\n- **Part B**: Explain how these elements work together to create a persuasive effect, referencing the text''s description of Richards''s interest in language producing understanding.\n- **Part C**: Evaluate the effectiveness of this rhetorical strategy based on the text''s discussion of rhetoric''s broader functions (enlightening understanding, influencing the will).\n**Answer Requirement**: Your analysis must be grounded in the text''s definitions and apply them to a real-world example.  '
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with Rhetorical Theory**\n\nThe text describes Richards''s critique of the ancient rhetoric focused solely on persuasion.

    Kenneth Burke has more reverence for the classical rhetoricians than I. A.
    Richards does, but like Richards, he sees the possibility of extending the
    scope of rhetoric. In an article in the Journal of General Education in 1951,
    a year after the publication of his A Rhetoric of Motives, Burke said: "If I
    had to sum up in one word the difference between the ‘old' rhetoric and a
    ‘new' (a rhetoric re-invigorated by fresh insights which the ‘new Science'
    contributed to the subject), I would reduce it to this: The key term for the
    old rhetoric was ‘persuasion' and its stress was upon deliberate design. The
    key term for the new rhetoric would be ‘identification,' which can include a
    partially ‘unconscious' factor in appeal." "Appeal" is the essence of com-
    munication for Burke. When men use symbols to induce co-operation in other hu-
    man beings, they must identify themselves with the audience, must, in
    Burke's term, become consubstantial with them. Rhetoric becomes for Burke
    a study of the various modes of achieving identification. Structure of any
    kind is a mode of identification. The way we structure or arrange our
    discourse, for instance, could be one of the ways in which we adjust our
    discourse to fit the needs of our audience. Style, too, can be a mode of
    identification, since it can be a conscious or an unconscious attempt on our
    part to suit our language to the level of the audience. Burke's "dramatistic
    pentad"—name, agent, agency (means), scene (background), purpose—
    constitutes his critical apparatus for analyzing the motivation of human acts.

    The text is from Classical rhetoric for the modern student-Oxford University Press by Corbett, Edward P. J..
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Burke''s Rhetorical Concepts**\n\nCompare and contrast the key terms ''persuasion'' (old rhetoric) and ''identification'' (new rhetoric) as defined by Burke.\n- **Step 1**: Explain how ''persuasion'' emphasizes deliberate design and its limitations.\n- **Step 2**: Describe how ''identification'' encompasses both conscious and unconscious factors in communication.\n- **Step 3**: Use the concept of ''consubstantiality'' to argue why identification is a more effective mode for achieving communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference the definitions provided and demonstrate an understanding of how these concepts relate to rhetorical strategies in modern communication.\n'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Dramatistic Pentad Analysis**\n\nAnalyze a real-world example of rhetoric using Burke''s dramatistic pentad (name, agent, agency, scene, purpose).\n- **Part A**: Choose a political speech or advertisement and identify the five elements of the pentad.\n- **Part B**: Explain how each element contributes to the overall purpose of the rhetoric.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of using these elements for achieving identification with the audience.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your example must be specific and demonstrate a clear application of Burke''s critical apparatus to real-life communication.\n'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Reasoning on Rhetorical Scope**\n\nEvaluate the claim that ''rhetoric is only relevant in modern times'' based on Burke''s discussion of classical rhetoricians and the ''new science.''\n- **Part A**: Explain how Burke''s reference to classical rhetoricians suggests that rhetoric is not limited to modern times.\n- **Part B**: Use the concept of ''identification'' to argue why rhetoric remains relevant in contemporary communication.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterargument to the claim that ''rhetoric is obsolete.'' Your argument must reference Burke''s emphasis on the role of symbols and appeal in communication.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate Burke''s ideas with logical reasoning to support your position on the relevance of rhetoric in modern contexts.'

    There is no room to explore further Burke's exciting and sometimes hard-
    to-understand "new rhetoric." Nor is there room to explore the refinements
    that modern advertisers have made on the art of persuasive rhetoric. Adver-
    tising agencies are the most successful practitioners in our time of the kind
    of rhetoric taught by Aristotle. Quintilian might raise some questions about
    the ethics of their profession, but even he would not deny that they have
    done a superlative job of influencing the buying-habits of consumers and
    thereby benefiting the economy of the nation. Their cousins, the public-rela-
    tions men, have learned many valuable lessons from them in fostering good
    public images of the institutions they represent.

    This survey of rhetoric, abbreviated and hurried as it is, has probably left
    the student's head swirling with names and titles and dates. It is not so im-
    portant that the student be able to recall and place all these details as it is
    that he be aware, in a general way, of the long and honorable tradition that
    classical rhetoric has enjoyed. His being aware of the history of rhetoric
    should make this book's approach to the problems of composition more
    meaningful and fruitful. The tradition of classical rhetoric may currently be
    dormant, but the discipline itself was not and is not moribund. What was
    once so vital cannot be, even with the passage of time and the creation of a
    new world, entirely irrelevant and ineffectual.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Logical Analysis of Rhetorical Relationships**\n\nThe text discusses various rhetorical relationships such as antecedent and consequence, cause and effect, and contradictions. Consider the following argument: \n\n"If a society is just, then it must promote equality. However, this society does not promote equality. Therefore, the society is unjust."\n\n- **Part A**: Identify which rhetorical relationship this argument employs. Justify your answer by referencing the definitions of antecedent and consequence, cause and effect, or contradictions from the text.\n- **Part B**: Evaluate the validity of this argument using logical reasoning. Does the conclusion logically follow from the premises? Explain your answer based on the text''s discussion of validity and logical structure.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterexample to challenge the argument''s conclusion. Your example must demonstrate how the premises could be true while the conclusion is false, thereby showing that the argument is not necessarily valid.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must explicitly reference at least two rhetorical relationships and the text''s discussion of validity to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of logical reasoning in rhetoric.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Synthesis of Rhetorical Techniques**\n\nThe text covers the use of special topics such as justice and injustice, virtue and vice, and worthy and expedient. Draft an argument that addresses the following claim: \n\n"In modern society, justice is more important than virtue."\n\n- **Part A**: Use the definitions of special topics provided in the text to define ''justice'' and ''virtue.''\n- **Part B**: Construct a logical argument that supports the claim. Your argument must incorporate at least two of the special topics discussed in the text (e.g., justice and injustice, or worthy and expedient).\n- **Part C**: Analyze the ethical implications of your argument. How does the prioritization of justice over virtue affect societal structure and individual behavior, according to the text''s discussion of virtue and vice?\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your argument must demonstrate an understanding of the special topics and their interrelationships, as well as the ethical considerations outlined in the text.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Critical Evaluation of Rhetorical Authority**\n\nThe text discusses the concepts of testimony, authority, law, and precedents. Evaluate the following statement: \n\n"The best arguments are those that cite historical precedents and legal rulings, as these are the most authoritative forms of reasoning."\n\n- **Part A**: Identify which rhetorical strategies are being referenced in this statement. Use the definitions of testimony, authority, law, and precedents from the text to support your analysis.\n- **Part B**: Critique the statement by examining its assumptions. Does it overstate the importance of historical and legal authorities in all rhetorical contexts? Use logical reasoning based on the text''s discussion of validity and the limitations of different types of evidence.\n- **Part C**: Construct a counterargument that challenges the statement''s validity. Your counterargument must reference at least two other rhetorical strategies discussed in the text (e.g., statistics, maxims) and demonstrate how they can be more effective in certain situations.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the concepts of authority, law, and precedents with an analysis of their limitations, as well as a critique of the statement''s assumptions using the text''s framework.'
