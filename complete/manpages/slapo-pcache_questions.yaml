For an incoming query, the proxy cache\n       determines its corresponding template. If the template was specified as\n       cacheable using the pcacheTemplate directive and the request is\n       contained in a cached request, it is answered from the proxy cache.\n       Otherwise, the search is performed as usual and cacheable search\n       results are saved in the cache for use in future queries.\n\n       A template is defined by a filter string and an index identifying a set\n       of attributes. The template string for a query can be obtained by\n       removing assertion values from the RFC 4515 representation of its\n       search filter. A query belongs to a template if its template string and\n       set of projected attributes correspond to a cacheable template.\n       Examples of template strings are (mail=), (|(sn=)(cn=)),\n       (&(sn=)(givenName=))."

These\n       inconsistencies can be minimized by careful use of the TTR.\n\n       The remote server should expose the objectClass attribute because the\n       underlying database that actually caches the entries may need it for\n       optimal local processing of the queries.\n\n       The proxy server should contain all the schema information required for\n       caching.  Significantly, it needs the schema of attributes used in the\n       query templates.  If the objectClass attribute is used in a query\n       template, it needs the definition of the objectClasses of the entries\n       it is supposed to cache.  It is the responsibility of the proxy\n       administrator to keep the proxy schema lined up with that of the\n       proxied server.\n\n       Another potential (and subtle) inconsistency may occur when data is\n       retrieved with different identities and specific per-identity access\n       control is enforced by the remote server.  If data was retrieved with\n       an identity that collected only partial results because of access rules\n       enforcement on the remote server, other users with different access\n       privileges on the remote server will get different results from the\n       remote server and from the cache.  If those users have higher access\n       privileges on the remote server, they will get from the cache only a\n       subset of the results they would get directly from the remote server;\n       but if they have lower access privileges, they will get from the cache\n       a superset of the results they would get directly from the remote\n       server.\tEither occurrence may or may not be acceptable, based on the\n       security policy of the cache and of the remote server.  It is important\n       to note that in this case the proxy is violating the security of the\n       remote server by disclosing to an identity data that was collected by\n       another identity.  For this reason, it is suggested that, when using\n       back-ldap, proxy caching be used in conjunction with the identity\n       assertion feature of slapd-ldap(5) (see the idassert-bind and the\n       idassert-authz statements), so that remote server interrogation occurs\n       with a vanilla identity that has some relatively high search and read\n       access privileges, and the \"real\" access control is delegated to the\n       proxy's ACLs.  Beware that since only the cached fraction of the real\n       datum is available to the cache, it may not be possible to enforce the\n       same access rules that are defined on the remote server.  When security\n       is a concern, cached proxy access must be carefully tailored.\n\nFILES\n       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf\n\t      default slapd configuration file\n\nSEE ALSO\n       slapd.conf(5), slapd-config(5), slapd-ldap(5), slapd-meta(5),\n       slapd-sql(5), slapd(8).\n\nAUTHOR\n       Originally implemented by Apurva Kumar as an extension to back-meta;\n       turned into an overlay by Howard Chu.\n\nOpenLDAP 2.4.28 \t\t  2011/11/24\t\t       SLAPO-PCACHE(5)"
