It converts\n       the page descriptions produced by your application (put a paragraph\n       here, draw a line there, and so forth) into something your printer can\n       understand and then sends the information to the printer for printing.\n\n       Now, since every printer manufacturer does things differently, printing\n       can be very complicated.  CUPS does its best to hide this from you and\n       your application so that you can concentrate on printing and less on\n       how to print. Generally, the only time you need to know anything about\n       your printer is when you use it for the first time, and even then CUPS\n       can often figure things out on its own.\n\n   HOW DOES IT WORK?\n       The first time you print to a printer, CUPS creates a queue to keep\n       track of the current status of the printer (everything OK, out of\n       paper, etc.) and any pages you have printed. Most of the time the queue\n       points to a printer connected directly to your computer via a USB port,\n       however it can also point to a printer on your network, a printer on\n       the Internet, or multiple printers depending on the configuration.\n       Regardless of where the queue points, it will look like any other\n       printer to you and your applications."

    Manpage text:

    Every time you print something, CUPS creates a job which contains the
           queue you are sending the print to, the name of the document you are
           printing, and the page descriptions. Job are numbered (queue-1,
           queue-2, and so forth) so you can monitor the job as it is printed or
           cancel it if you see a mistake. When CUPS gets a job for printing, it
           determines the best programs (filters, printer drivers, port monitors,
           and backends) to convert the pages into a printable format and then
           runs them to actually print the job.

           When the print job is completely printed, CUPS removes the job from the
           queue and moves on to any other jobs you have submitted. You can also
           be notified when the job is finished, or if there are any errors during
           printing, in several different ways.

       WHERE DO I BEGIN?
           The easiest way to start is by using the web interface to configure
           your printer. Go to "http://localhost:631" and choose the
           Administration tab at the top of the page. Click/press on the Add
           Printer button and follow the prompts.

    Manpage text:

    When you are asked for a username and password, enter your login
           username and password or the "root" username and password.

           After the printer is added you will be asked to set the default printer
           options (paper size, output mode, etc.) for the printer. Make any
           changes as needed and then click/press on the Set Default Options
           button to save them. Some printers also support auto-configuration -
           click/press on the Query Printer for Default Options button to update
           the options automatically.

           Once you have added the printer, you can print to it from any
           application. You can also choose Print Test Page from the maintenance
           menu to print a simple test page and verify that everything is working
           properly.

           You can also use the lpadmin(8) and lpinfo(8) commands to add printers
           to CUPS.  Additionally, your operating system may include graphical
           user interfaces or automatically create printer queues when you connect
           a printer to your computer.
