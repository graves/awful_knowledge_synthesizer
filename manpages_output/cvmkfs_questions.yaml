If no name is supplied, a list of volumes configured will be\n       presented. Active file systems may not be re-initialized. The user will\n       be prompted for a confirmation before initializing the volume.\n\n       WARNING: This will destroy ANY existing volume data for the named Xsan\n       volume!\n\nOPTIONS\n       -a key Set the affinity of the root directory to key.\n\n       -e     When remaking a managed file system in preparation for restoring\n\t      all metadata from a metadata archive, the -e option specifies\n\t      that the FSM should restore all user file extents. When this\n\t      option is not specified, files are truncated which results in\n\t      them being restored from backup.\tUse this option when the\n\t      metadata disks must be restored but all disks containing user\n\t      data are intact. This option can only be used in conjunction\n\t      with the -r option and is ignored when restoring unmanaged file\n\t      systems."

It does this because it is possible for the\n\t      restore procedure to inadvertently allocate disk space for\n\t      metadata that conflicts with user data, resulting in file\n\t      corruption.

Use this option\n\t      only if instructed by Quantum support."
