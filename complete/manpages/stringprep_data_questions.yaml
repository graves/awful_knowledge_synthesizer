It is an internal\n       package which should not be accessed on its own. Because of that it has\n       no publicly documented API either. Its implementation is generated by a\n       script.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category stringprep\n       of the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       stringprep, unicode\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2007-2009, Sergei Golovan <sgolovan@nes.ru>"
