See xpc_transaction_begin(3) and\n     launchd.plist(5) for more information about the mechanism and its use.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -i       Show internal kernel boosts\n\n     -s       Show stacks for internal boosts.\n\n     -p pid   Limit events to the process identified by pid.\n\n     -d       Display raw Dtrace output; do not reformat timestamps and sort\n\t      output.\n\n     The traced events are as follows:\n\n     BOOSTED\t     The specified process has received a boost and\n\t\t     transitioned out of the background.\n\n     UNBOOST\t     The specified process has dropped its last remaining\n\t\t     boost and transitioned back into the background."

Boosted and\n     unboost events may appear before the triggering recv or drop boost."
