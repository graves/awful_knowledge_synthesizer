It relies completely on the underlying\n       operating system for memory management and does no caching of its own.\n\n       The mdb backend is similar to the hdb backend in that it uses a\n       hierarchical database layout which supports subtree renames. It is both\n       more space-efficient and more execution-efficient than the bdb backend,\n       while being overall much simpler to manage.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       These slapd.conf options apply to the mdb backend database.  That is,\n       they must follow a \"database mdb\" line and come before any subsequent\n       \"backend\" or \"database\" lines.  Other database options are described in\n       the slapd.conf(5) manual page.\n\n       checkpoint_<kbyte>_<min>\n\t      Specify the frequency for flushing the database disk buffers.\n\t      This setting is only needed if the dbnosync option is used.  The\n\t      checkpoint will occur if either <kbyte> data has been written or\n\t      <min> minutes have passed since the last checkpoint.  Both\n\t      arguments default to zero, in which case they are ignored. When\n\t      the <min> argument is non-zero, an internal task will run every\n\t      <min> minutes to perform the checkpoint.\tNote: currently the\n\t      <kbyte> setting is unimplemented."

Enabling this option may\n\t      improve performance at the expense of data security. In\n\t      particular, if the operating system crashes before changes are\n\t      flushed, some number of transactions may be lost.  By default, a\n\t      full data flush/sync is performed when each transaction is\n\t      committed.\n\n       directory_<directory>\n\t      Specify the directory where the MDB files containing this\n\t      database and associated indexes live.  A separate directory must\n\t      be specified for each database.  The default is\n\t      /var/db/openldap/openldap-data.\n\n       index {<attrlist>|default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,<special>]\n\t      Specify the indexes to maintain for the given attribute (or list\n\t      of attributes).  Some attributes only support a subset of\n\t      indexes.\tIf only an <attr> is given, the indices specified for\n\t      default are maintained.  Note that setting a default does not\n\t      imply that all attributes will be indexed. Also, for best\n\t      performance, an eq index should always be configured for the\n\t      objectClass attribute."
