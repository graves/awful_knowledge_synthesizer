This is the\n       default mode.  A second mode allows updating the comments in a zipfile\n       as well as allows changing the names of the files in the zipfile.\n       These modes are described below.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n       To write all comments in a zipfile to stdout use for example\n\n\t    zipnote foo.zip > foo.tmp\n\n       This writes all comments in the zipfile foo.zip to the file foo.tmp in\n       a specific format."
