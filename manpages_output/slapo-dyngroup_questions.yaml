Compare operations targeting a group's static\n       member attribute will be intercepted and tested against the configured\n       dynamic group's URL attribute.\n\n       Note that this intercept only happens if the actual Compare operation\n       does not return a LDAP_COMPARE_TRUE result. So if a group has both\n       static and dynamic members, the static member list will be checked\n       first.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       This slapd.conf option applies to the Dynamic Group overlay.  It should\n       appear after the overlay directive.\n\n       attrpair <memberAttr> <URLattr>\n\t      Specify the attributes to be compared. A compare operation on\n\t      the memberAttr will cause the URLattr to be evaluated for the\n\t      result."

  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain how the dynamic group overlay handles a Compare operation when both static and dynamic members are present?
