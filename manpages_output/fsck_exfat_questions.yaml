The default behavior is to always ask for confirmation of\n     each change.  Use the -n or -y options to override this default behavior.\n\n     The device parameter(s) should be a path to a \"raw\" disk device (a\n     character special device), such as /dev/rdisk1s1.\tIf you specify a \"non-\n     raw\" path (a block special device) such as /dev/disk1s1, or just the disk\n     name such as disk1s1, they will automatically be converted to the\n     corresponding raw disk device (/dev/rdisk1s1)."

This functionality is\n\t\t   intended for inclusion with bug reports regarding\n\t\t   excpetional problems. One file is created for each checked\n\t\t   device. A shadow file's name is created by taking\n\t\t   path_prefix, appending a - character, and then appending\n\t\t   the basename of the device being checked. For instance,\n\t\t   given a path_prefix of ./metadata, a check of disk\n\t\t   /dev/rdisk3s1 would create the shadow file\n\t\t   ./metadata-rdisk3s1.  Note that the shadow file captures\n\t\t   all metadata as read from disk. In some cases with large\n\t\t   volumes, fsck_exfat will limit its cache size and re-read\n\t\t   metadata from disk at different phases of the repair\n\t\t   process. If the repair process has repaired the metadata,\n\t\t   the shadow file will capture its state as last read from\n\t\t   disk. For optimal debug value, the shadow file should be\n\t\t   captured in conjunction with the -n option. This file will\n\t\t   be created as a sparse file, if it is on a file system\n\t\t   supporting sparse files, such as APFS.  The shadow file\n\t\t   does not capture file contents. However be aware the shadow\n\t\t   file includes details about all current and some past\n\t\t   files. Extreme care should be taken before sharing the\n\t\t   shadow file with others."
