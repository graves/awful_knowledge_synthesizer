If no file is specified, the block usage of the\n     hierarchy rooted in the current directory is displayed.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -A      Display the apparent size instead of the disk usage.  This can be\n\t     helpful when operating on compressed volumes or sparse files.\n\n     -B blocksize\n\t     Calculate block counts in blocksize byte blocks.  This is\n\t     different from the -h, -k, -m, --si and -g options or setting\n\t     BLOCKSIZE and gives an estimate of how much space the examined\n\t     file hierarchy would require on a filesystem with the given\n\t     blocksize.  Unless in -A mode, blocksize is rounded up to the\n\t     next multiple of 512."
