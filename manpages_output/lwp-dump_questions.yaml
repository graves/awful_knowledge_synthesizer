Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `lwp-dump`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nLWP-DUMP(1)\t      User Contributed Perl Documentation\t   LWP-DUMP(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       lwp-dump - See what headers and content is returned for a URL\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       lwp-dump [ options ] URL\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The lwp-dump program will get the resource identified by the URL and\n       then dump the response object to STDOUT.  This will display the headers\n       returned and the initial part of the content, escaped so that it's safe\n       to display even binary content.\tThe escapes syntax used is the same as\n       for Perl's double quoted strings.  If there is no content the string\n       \"(no content)\" is shown in its place.\n\n       The following options are recognized:\n\n       --agent string\n\t   Override the user agent string passed to the server.\n\n       --keep-client-headers\n\t   LWP internally generate various \"Client-*\" headers that are\n\t   stripped by lwp-dump in order to show the headers exactly as the\n\t   server provided them.  This option will suppress this.\n\n       --max-length n\n\t   How much of the content to show.  The default is 512.  Set this to\n\t   0 for unlimited.\n\n\t   If the content is longer then the string is chopped at the limit\n\t   and the string \"...\\n(### more bytes not shown)\" appended.\n\n       --method string\n\t   Use the given method for the request instead of the default \"GET\".\n\n       --parse-head\n\t   By default lwp-dump will not try to initialize headers by looking\n\t   at the head section of HTML documents.  This option enables this.\n\t   This corresponds to \"parse_head\" in LWP::UserAgent.\n\n       --request\n\t   Also dump the request sent.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       lwp-request, LWP, \"dump\" in HTTP::Message\n\nperl v5.34.0\t\t\t  2020-04-14\t\t\t   LWP-DUMP(1)"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the lwp-dump command?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use lwp-dump to retrieve and display the headers and initial part of the content for a specific URL?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using lwp-dump with the --max-length option to limit the amount of content displayed?
