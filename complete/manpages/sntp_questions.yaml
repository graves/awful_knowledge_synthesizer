This does\n\t      not have to be less than, equal to, or greater than the number\n\t      of records that any host lookup returns. Numbers smaller than\n\t      the number of records will fetch only that many records. Numbers\n\t      larger than the number of records will fetch some records more\n\t      than once, as required, to reach the number of fetches desired.\n\n     -r       bind(2) the NTP reserved port (123) for source communications.\n\n     -S       Use clock_settime(2) to set the system clock if the offset is\n\t      greater than 50 milliseconds, or -s is not specified.\n\n     -s       Use adjtime(2) to slew the system clock if the offset is less\n\t      than 50 milliseconds."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the sntp command?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the sntp command to set the system clock when the offset is greater than 50 milliseconds?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the sntp command to fetch multiple DNS records for a given host?
