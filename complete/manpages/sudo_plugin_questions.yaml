Plugins may be compiled as dynamic shared objects\n       (the default on systems that support them) or compiled statically into\n       the sudo binary itself.\tBy default, the sudoers plugin provides audit,\n       security policy and I/O logging capabilities.  Via the plugin API, sudo\n       can be configured to use alternate plugins provided by third parties.\n       The plugins to be used are specified in the sudo.conf(5) file.\n\n       The API is versioned with a major and minor number.  The minor version\n       number is incremented when additions are made.  The major number is\n       incremented when incompatible changes are made.\tA plugin should be\n       check the version passed to it and make sure that the major version\n       matches.\n\n       The plugin API is defined by the <sudo_plugin.h> header file."
