    NAME
           perlootut - Object-Oriented Programming in Perl Tutorial

    DATE
           This document was created in February, 2011, and the last major
           revision was in February, 2013.

           If you are reading this in the future then it's possible that the state
           of the art has changed. We recommend you start by reading the perlootut
           document in the latest stable release of Perl, rather than this
           version.

    DESCRIPTION
           This document provides an introduction to object-oriented programming
           in Perl. It begins with a brief overview of the concepts behind object
           oriented design. Then it introduces several different OO systems from
           CPAN <https://www.cpan.org> which build on top of what Perl provides.

           By default, Perl's built-in OO system is very minimal, leaving you to
           do most of the work. This minimalism made a lot of sense in 1994, but
           in the years since Perl 5.0 we've seen a number of common patterns
           emerge in Perl OO. Fortunately, Perl's flexibility has allowed a rich
           ecosystem of Perl OO systems to flourish.

    If you want to know how Perl OO works under the hood, the perlobj
           document explains the nitty gritty details.

           This document assumes that you already understand the basics of Perl
           syntax, variable types, operators, and subroutine calls. If you don't
           understand these concepts yet, please read perlintro first. You should
           also read the perlsyn, perlop, and perlsub documents.

    OBJECT-ORIENTED FUNDAMENTALS
           Most object systems share a number of common concepts. You've probably
           heard terms like "class", "object, "method", and "attribute" before.
           Understanding the concepts will make it much easier to read and write
           object-oriented code. If you're already familiar with these terms, you
           should still skim this section, since it explains each concept in terms
           of Perl's OO implementation.

           Perl's OO system is class-based. Class-based OO is fairly common. It's
           used by Java, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, and many other languages. There
           are other object orientation paradigms as well. JavaScript is the most
           popular language to use another paradigm. JavaScript's OO system is
           prototype-based.

    Object
           An object is a data structure that bundles together data and
           subroutines which operate on that data. An object's data is called
           attributes, and its subroutines are called methods. An object can be
           thought of as a noun (a person, a web service, a computer).

           An object represents a single discrete thing. For example, an object
           might represent a file. The attributes for a file object might include
           its path, content, and last modification time. If we created an object
           to represent /etc/hostname on a machine named "foo.example.com", that
           object's path would be "/etc/hostname", its content would be "foo\n",
           and it's last modification time would be 1304974868 seconds since the
           beginning of the epoch.

           The methods associated with a file might include "rename()" and
           "write()".

           In Perl most objects are hashes, but the OO systems we recommend keep
           you from having to worry about this. In practice, it's best to consider
           an object's internal data structure opaque.

A blessed data structure (aka \"a\n       referent\") is an object. We sometimes say that an object has been\n       \"blessed into a class\".\n\n       Once a referent has been blessed, the \"blessed\" function from the\n       Scalar::Util core module can tell us its class name.

    Manpage text:

    Attributes are typically defined as read-only or read-write. Read-only
           attributes can only be set when the object is first created, while
           read-write attributes can be altered at any time.

           The value of an attribute may itself be another object. For example,
           instead of returning its last mod time as a number, the "File" class
           could return a DateTime object representing that value.

           It's possible to have a class that does not expose any publicly
           settable attributes. Not every class has attributes and methods.

       Polymorphism
           Polymorphism is a fancy way of saying that objects from two different
           classes share an API. For example, we could have "File" and "WebPage"
           classes which both have a "print_content()" method. This method might
           produce different output for each class, but they share a common
           interface.

           While the two classes may differ in many ways, when it comes to the
           "print_content()" method, they are the same. This means that we can try
           to call the "print_content()" method on an object of either class, and
           we don't have to know what class the object belongs to!

    Manpage text:

    We mentioned earlier that most Perl objects are implemented as hashes
           under the hood. The principle of encapsulation tells us that we should
           not rely on this. Instead, we should use accessor methods to access the
           data in that hash. The object systems that we recommend below all
           automate the generation of accessor methods. If you use one of them,
           you should never have to access the object as a hash directly.

       Composition
           In object-oriented code, we often find that one object references
           another object. This is called composition, or a has-a relationship.

           Earlier, we mentioned that the "File" class's "last_mod_time" accessor
           could return a DateTime object. This is a perfect example of
           composition. We could go even further, and make the "path" and
           "content" accessors return objects as well. The "File" class would then
           be composed of several other objects.

       Roles
           Roles are something that a class does, rather than something that it
           is. Roles are relatively new to Perl, but have become rather popular.
           Roles are applied to classes. Sometimes we say that classes consume
           roles.

    Roles are an alternative to inheritance for providing polymorphism.
           Let's assume we have two classes, "Radio" and "Computer". Both of these
           things have on/off switches. We want to model that in our class
           definitions.

           We could have both classes inherit from a common parent, like
           "Machine", but not all machines have on/off switches. We could create a
           parent class called "HasOnOffSwitch", but that is very artificial.
           Radios and computers are not specializations of this parent. This
           parent is really a rather ridiculous creation.

           This is where roles come in. It makes a lot of sense to create a
           "HasOnOffSwitch" role and apply it to both classes. This role would
           define a known API like providing "turn_on()" and "turn_off()" methods.

           Perl does not have any built-in way to express roles. In the past,

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlootut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n\"Moose\" provides a complete, modern OO system. Its biggest influence is\n       the Common Lisp Object System, but it also borrows ideas from Smalltalk\n       and several other languages. \"Moose\" was created by Stevan Little, and\n       draws heavily from his work on the Raku OO design.\n\n       Here is our \"File\" class using \"Moose\":\n\n\t package File;\n\t use Moose;\n\n\t has path\t   => ( is => 'ro' );\n\t has content\t   => ( is => 'ro' );\n\t has last_mod_time => ( is => 'ro' );\n\n\t sub print_info {\n\t     my $self = shift;\n\n\t     print \"This file is at \", $self->path, \"\\n\";\n\t }\n\n       \"Moose\" provides a number of features:\n\n       •   Declarative sugar\n\n\t   \"Moose\" provides a layer of declarative \"sugar\" for defining\n\t   classes.  That sugar is just a set of exported functions that make\n\t   declaring how your class works simpler and more palatable.  This\n\t   lets you describe what your class is, rather than having to tell\n\t   Perl how to implement your class.\n\n\t   The \"has()\" subroutine declares an attribute, and \"Moose\"\n\t   automatically creates accessors for these attributes. It also takes\n\t   care of creating a \"new()\" method for you. This constructor knows\n\t   about the attributes you declared, so you can set them when\n\t   creating a new \"File\"."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlootut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n•   Roles built-in\n\n\t   \"Moose\" lets you define roles the same way you define classes:\n\n\t     package HasOnOffSwitch;\n\t     use Moose::Role;\n\n\t     has is_on => (\n\t\t is  => 'rw',\n\t\t isa => 'Bool',\n\t     );\n\n\t     sub turn_on {\n\t\t my $self = shift;\n\t\t $self->is_on(1);\n\t     }\n\n\t     sub turn_off {\n\t\t my $self = shift;\n\t\t $self->is_on(0);\n\t     }\n\n       •   A miniature type system\n\n\t   In the example above, you can see that we passed \"isa => 'Bool'\" to\n\t   \"has()\" when creating our \"is_on\" attribute. This tells \"Moose\"\n\t   that this attribute must be a boolean value. If we try to set it to\n\t   an invalid value, our code will throw an error.\n\n       •   Full introspection and manipulation\n\n\t   Perl's built-in introspection features are fairly minimal. \"Moose\"\n\t   builds on top of them and creates a full introspection layer for\n\t   your classes. This lets you ask questions like \"what methods does\n\t   the File class implement?\" It also lets you modify your classes\n\t   programmatically.\n\n       •   Self-hosted and extensible"

Besides\n\t   being a cool trick, this means that you can extend \"Moose\" using\n\t   \"Moose\" itself.\n\n       •   Rich ecosystem\n\n\t   There is a rich ecosystem of \"Moose\" extensions on CPAN under the\n\t   MooseX <https://metacpan.org/search?q=MooseX> namespace.

    This load time hit can be a problem when startup speed is important,
           such as with a command-line script or a "plain vanilla" CGI script that
           must be loaded each time it is executed.

           Before you panic, know that many people do use "Moose" for command-line
           tools and other startup-sensitive code. We encourage you to try "Moose"
           out first before worrying about startup speed.

           "Moose" also has several dependencies on other modules. Most of these
           are small stand-alone modules, a number of which have been spun off
           from "Moose". "Moose" itself, and some of its dependencies, require a
           compiler. If you need to install your software on a system without a
           compiler, or if having any dependencies is a problem, then "Moose" may
           not be right for you.

           Moo

           If you try "Moose" and find that one of these issues is preventing you
           from using "Moose", we encourage you to consider Moo next. "Moo"
           implements a subset of "Moose"'s functionality in a simpler package.
           For most features that it does implement, the end-user API is identical
           to "Moose", meaning you can switch from "Moo" to "Moose" quite easily.

    Manpage text:

    "Moo" does not implement most of "Moose"'s introspection API, so it's
           often faster when loading your modules. Additionally, none of its
           dependencies require XS, so it can be installed on machines without a
           compiler.

           One of "Moo"'s most compelling features is its interoperability with
           "Moose". When someone tries to use "Moose"'s introspection API on a
           "Moo" class or role, it is transparently inflated into a "Moose" class
           or role. This makes it easier to incorporate "Moo"-using code into a
           "Moose" code base and vice versa.

           For example, a "Moose" class can subclass a "Moo" class using "extends"
           or consume a "Moo" role using "with".

           The "Moose" authors hope that one day "Moo" can be made obsolete by
           improving "Moose" enough, but for now it provides a worthwhile
           alternative to "Moose".

       Class::Accessor
           Class::Accessor is the polar opposite of "Moose". It provides very few
           features, nor is it self-hosting.
