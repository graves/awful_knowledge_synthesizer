If no files are listed on the command-line, lpr reads\n       the print file from the standard input.\n\n   THE DEFAULT DESTINATION\n       CUPS provides many ways to set the default destination. The LPDEST and\n       PRINTER environment variables are consulted first.  If neither are set,\n       the current default set using the lpoptions(1) command is used,\n       followed by the default set using the lpadmin(8) command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       The following options are recognized by lpr:\n\n       -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server."
