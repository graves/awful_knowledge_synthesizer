Entries retrieved\n       from a remote LDAP server may have some or all attributes overridden,\n       or new attributes added, by entries in the local database before being\n       presented to the client.\n\n       A search operation is first populated with entries from the remote LDAP\n       server, the attributes of which are then overridden with any attributes\n       defined in the local database. Local overrides may be populated with\n       the add, modify , and modrdn operations, the use of which is restricted\n       to the root user.\n\n       A compare operation will perform a comparison with attributes defined\n       in the local database record (if any) before any comparison is made\n       with data in the remote database.\n\nCONFIGURATION\n       The Translucent Proxy overlay uses a proxied database, typically a (set\n       of) remote LDAP server(s), which is configured with the options shown\n       in slapd-ldap(5), slapd-meta(5) or similar.  These slapd.conf options\n       are specific to the Translucent Proxy overlay; they must appear after\n       the overlay directive that instantiates the translucent overlay.\n\n       translucent_strict\n\t      By default, attempts to delete attributes in either the local or\n\t      remote databases will be silently ignored. The\n\t      translucent_strict directive causes these modifications to fail\n\t      with a Constraint Violation.\n\n       translucent_no_glue\n\t      This configuration option disables the automatic creation of\n\t      \"glue\" records for an add or modrdn operation, such that all\n\t      parents of an entry added to the local database must be created\n\t      by hand. Glue records are always created for a modify operation.\n\n       translucent_local <attr[,attr...]>\n\t      Specify a list of attributes that should be searched for in the\n\t      local database when used in a search filter. By default, search\n\t      filters are only handled by the remote database. With this\n\t      directive, search filters will be split into a local and remote\n\t      portion, and local attributes will be searched locally.\n\n       translucent_remote <attr[,attr...]>\n\t      Specify a list of attributes that should be searched for in the\n\t      remote database when used in a search filter. This directive\n\t      complements the translucent_local directive. Attributes may be\n\t      specified as both local and remote if desired.\n\n       If neither translucent_local nor translucent_remote are specified, the\n       default behavior is to search the remote database with the complete\n       search filter. If only translucent_local is specified, searches will\n       only be run on the local database. Likewise, if only translucent_remote\n       is specified, searches will only be run on the remote database. In any\n       case, both the local and remote entries corresponding to a search\n       result will be merged before being returned to the client."
