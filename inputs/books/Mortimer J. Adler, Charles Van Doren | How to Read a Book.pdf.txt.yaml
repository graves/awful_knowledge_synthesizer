    PREFACE  
    
    How to Read a Book was first published in the early months  
    of 1940. To my surprise and, I confess, to my delight, it im-  
    mediately became a best seller and remained at the top of the  
    nationwide best-seller list for more than a year. Since 1940, it  
    has continued to be widely circulated in numerous printings,  
    both hardcover and paperback, and it has been translated into  
    other languages—French, Swedish, German, Spanish, and Ital-  
    ian. Why, then, attempt to recast and rewrite the book for the  
    present generation of readers?
  - |-
    The reasons for doing so lie in changes that have taken
    place both in our society in the last thirty years and in the
    subject itself. Today many more of the young men and women
    who complete high school enter and complete four years of
    college; a much larger proportion of the population has be-
    come literate in spite of or even because of the popularity of
    radio and television. There has been a shift of interest from
    the reading of fiction to the reading of nonfiction. The edu-
    cators of the country have acknowledged that teaching the
    young to read, in the most elementary sense of that word, is
    our paramount educational problem. A recent Secretary of
    the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, designat-
    ing the seventies as the Decade of Reading, has dedicated
    federal funds in support of a wide variety of efforts to improve
    
    ix
    
    x Preface
    
    proficiency in this basic skill, and many of those efforts have
    scored some success at the level at which children are initiated
    into the art of reading. In addition, adults in large numbers
    have been captivated by the glittering promises made by
    speed-reading courses—promises to increase their comprehen-
    sion of what they read as well as their speed in reading it.
    
    However, certain things have not changed in the last thirty
    years. One constant is that, to achieve all the purposes of read-
    ing, the desideratum must be the ability to read different
    things at different—appropriate—speeds, not everything at the
    greatest possible speed. As Pascal observed three hundred
    years ago, "When we read too fast or too slowly, we under-
    stand nothing." Since speed-reading has become a national fad,
    this new edition of How to Read a Book deals with the prob-
    lem and proposes variable-speed-reading as the solution, the
    aim being to read better, always better, but sometimes slower,
    sometimes faster.
  - |-
    Another thing that has not changed, unfortunately, is the
    failure to carry instruction in reading beyond the elementary
    level. Most of our educational ingenuity, money, and effort is
    spent on reading instruction in the first six grades. Beyond
    that, little formal training is provided to carry students to
    higher and quite distinct levels of skill. That was true in
    1939 when Professor James Mursell of Columbia University's
    Teachers College wrote an article for the Atlantic Monthly
    entitled "The Failure of the Schools." What he said then, in
    two paragraphs that I am now going to quote, is still true.
    
    Do pupils in school learn to read their mother tongue effectively? Yes and no. Up to the fifth and sixth grade, reading, on the
    whole, is effectively taught and well learned. To that level we find
    a steady and general improvement, but beyond it the curves flatten
    out to a dead level. This is not because a person arrives at his
    natural limit of efficiency when he reaches the sixth grade, for it
    has been shown again and again that with special tuition much
    older children, and also adults, can make enormous improvement.
    Nor does it mean that most sixth-graders read well enough for all
    practical purposes. A great many pupils do poorly in high school
    because of sheer ineptitude in getting meaning from the printed
    page. They can improve; they need to improve; but they don't.
    
    The average high-school graduate has done a great deal of
    reading, and if he goes on to college he will do a great deal more;
    but he is likely to be a poor and incompetent reader. (Note that
    this holds true of the average student, not the person who is a
    subject for special remedial treatment.) He can follow a simple
    piece of fiction and enjoy it. But put him up against a closely
    written exposition, a carefully and economically stated argument,
    or a passage requiring critical consideration, and he is at a loss. It
    has been shown, for instance, that the average high-school student
    is amazingly inept at indicating the central thought of a passage,
    or the levels of emphasis and subordination in an argument or
    exposition. To all intents and purposes he remains a sixth-grade
    reader till well along in college.
  - |-
    If there was a need for How to Read a Book thirty years ago, as the reception of the first edition of the book would certainly seem to indicate, the need is much greater today. But responding to that greater need is not the only, nor, for that matter, the main motive in rewriting the book. New insights into the problems of learning how to read; a much more comprehensive and better-ordered analysis of the complex art of reading; the flexible application of the basic rules to different types of reading, in fact to every variety of reading matter; the discovery and formulation of new rules of reading; and the conception of a pyramid of books to read, broad at the bottom and tapering at the top—all these things, not treated adequately or not treated at all in the book that I wrote thirty years ago, called for exposition and demanded the thorough rewriting that has now been done and is here being published.
    
    The year after How to Read a Book was published, a parody of it appeared under the title How to Read Two Books; and Professor I. A. Richards wrote a serious treatise entitled How to Read a Page. I mention both these sequels in order to point out that the problems of reading suggested by both of these titles, the jocular as well as the serious one, are fully treated in this rewriting, especially the problem of how to read a number of related books in relation to one another and read them in such a way that the complementary and conflicting things they have to say about a common subject are clearly grasped.

    Among the reasons for rewriting How to Read a Book, I
    have stressed the things to be said about the art of reading
    and the points to be made about the need for acquiring higher
    levels of skill in this art, which were not touched on or de-
    veloped in the original version of the book. Anyone who
    wishes to discover how much has been added can do so
    quickly by comparing the present Table of Contents with that
    of the original version. Of the four parts, only Part Two, ex-
    pounding the rules of Analytical Reading, closely parallels the
    content of the original, and even that has been largely recast.
    The introduction in Part One of the distinction of four levels
    of reading—elementary, inspectional, analytical, and syntopical
    —is the basic and controlling change in the book's organiza-
    tion and content. The exposition in Part Three of the different
    ways to approach different kinds of reading materials—prac-
    tical and theoretical books, imaginative literature (lyric poetry,
    epics, novels, plays), history, science and mathematics, social
    science, and philosophy, as well as reference books, current
    journalism, and even advertising—is the most extensive addi-
    tion that has been made. Finally, the discussion of Syntopical
    Reading in Part Four is wholly new.
    
    In the work of updating, recasting, and rewriting this
    book, I have been joined by Charles Van Doren, who for
    many years now has been my associate at the Institute for
    Philosophical Research. We have worked together on other
    books, notably the twenty-volume Annals of America, pub-
    lished by Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., in 1969. What is,
    perhaps, more relevant to the present cooperative venture in
    which we have been engaged as co-authors is that during the
    last eight years Charles Van Doren and I have worked closely
    together in conducting discussion groups on great books and
    in moderating executive seminars in Chicago, San Francisco,
    and Aspen. In the course of these experiences, we acquired
    many of the new insights that have gone into the rewriting
    of this book.
  - |-
    I am grateful to Mr. Van Doren for the contribution he
    has made to our joint effort; and he and I together wish to
    express our deepest gratitude for all the constructive criticism,
    guidance, and help that we have received from our friend
    Arthur L. H. Rubin, who persuaded us to introduce many of
    the important changes that distinguish this book from its pred-
    ecessor and make it, we hope, a better and more useful book.

    HOW
    TO READ
    A BOOK
    
    PART ONE
    
    The Dimensions
    of Reading
    
    1
    
    THE ACTIVITY AND ART
    OF READING
    
    This is a book for readers and for those who wish to become
    readers, Particularly, it is for readers of books. Even more par-
    ticularly, it is for those whose main purpose in reading books
    is to gain increased understanding.
    
    By "readers" we mean people who are still accustomed, as
    almost every literate and intelligent person used to be, to gain
    a large share of their information about and their understand-
    ing of the world from the written word. Not all of it, of course;
    even in the days before radio and television, a certain amount
    of information and understanding was acquired through spoken
    words and through observation. But for intelligent and curious
    people that was never enough. They knew that they had to
    read too, and they did read.
    
    There is some feeling nowadays that reading is not as
    necessary as it once was. Radio and especially television have
    taken over many of the functions once served by print, just as
    photography has taken over functions once served by painting
    and other graphic arts. Admittedly, television serves some of
    these functions extremely well; the visual communication of
    news events, for example, has enormous impact. The ability of
    radio to give us information while we are engaged in doing
    other things—for instance, driving a car—is remarkable, and a
    great saving of time. But it may be seriously questioned
    
    3
    
    4 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    whether the advent of modern communications media has
    much enhanced our understanding of the world in which we
    live.
  - |-
    Perhaps we know more about the world than we used to,
    and insofar as knowledge is prerequisite to understanding, that
    is all to the good. But knowledge is not as much a prerequisite
    to understanding as is commonly supposed. We do not have to
    know everything about something in order to understand it;
    too many facts are often as much of an obstacle to understanding as too few. There is a sense in which we moderns are inundated with facts to the detriment of understanding.
    
    One of the reasons for this situation is that the very media
    we have mentioned are so designed as to make thinking seem
    unnecessary (though this is only an appearance). The packaging of intellectual positions and views is one of the most active enterprises of some of the best minds of our day. The viewer of television, the listener to radio, the reader of magazines, is presented with a whole complex of elements—all the way from ingenious rhetoric to carefully selected data and statistics—to make it easy for him to "make up his own mind" with the minimum of difficulty and effort. But the packaging is often done so effectively that the viewer, listener, or reader does not make up his own mind at all. Instead, he inserts a packaged opinion into his mind, somewhat like inserting a cassette into a cassette player. He then pushes a button and "plays back" the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so. He has performed acceptably without having had to think.
    
    Active Reading
    
    As we said at the beginning, we will be principally concerned in these pages with the development of skill in reading books; but the rules of reading that, if followed and practiced, develop such skill can be applied also to printed material in
    general, to any type of reading matter—to newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, articles, tracts, even advertisements.

    Since reading of any sort is an activity, all reading must
    to some degree be active. Completely passive reading is im-
    possible; we cannot read with our eyes immobilized and our
    minds asleep. Hence when we contrast active with passive
    reading, our purpose is, first, to call attention to the fact that
    reading can be more or less active, and second, to point out
    that the more active the reading the better. One reader is
    better than another in proportion as he is capable of a greater
    range of activity in reading and exerts more effort. He is
    better if he demands more of himself and of the text before
    him.
    
    Though, strictly speaking, there can be no absolutely pas-
    sive reading, many people think that, as compared with writing
    and speaking, which are obviously active undertakings, reading
    and listening are entirely passive. The writer or speaker must
    put out some effort, but no work need be done by the reader
    or listener. Reading and listening are thought of as receiving
    communication from someone who is actively engaged in
    giving or sending it. The mistake here is to suppose that re-
    ceiving communication is like receiving a blow or a legacy or
    a judgment from the court. On the contrary, the reader or
    listener is much more like the catcher in a game of baseball.
    
    Catching the ball is just as much an activity as pitching or
    hitting it. The pitcher or batter is the sender in the sense that
    his activity initiates the motion of the ball. The catcher or
    fielder is the receiver in the sense that his activity terminates
    it. Both are active, though the activities are different. If any-
    thing is passive, it is the ball. It is the inert thing that is put in
    motion or stopped, whereas the players are active, moving to
    pitch, hit, or catch. The analogy with writing and reading is
    almost perfect. The thing that is written and read, like the ball,
    is the passive object common to the two activities that begin
    and terminate the process.
    
    We can take this analogy a step further. The art of catch-
    ing is the skill of catching every kind of pitch—fast balls and
    curves, changeups and knucklers. Similarly, the art of reading
    is the skill of catching every sort of communication as well as
    possible.
  - |-
    It is noteworthy that the pitcher and catcher are successful only to the extent that they cooperate. The relation of writer and reader is similar. The writer isn't trying not to be caught, although it sometimes seems so. Successful communication occurs in any case where what the writer wanted to have received finds its way into the reader's possession. The writer's skill and the reader's skill converge upon a common end.
    
    Admittedly, writers vary, just as pitchers do. Some writers have excellent "control"; they know exactly what they want to convey, and they convey it precisely and accurately. Other things being equal, they are easier to "catch" than a "wild" writer without "control."
    
    There is one respect in which the analogy breaks down. The ball is a simple unit. It is either completely caught or not. A piece of writing, however, is a complex object. It can be received more or less completely, all the way from very little of what the writer intended to the whole of it. The amount the reader "catches" will usually depend on the amount of activity he puts into the process, as well as upon the skill with which he executes the different mental acts involved.
    
    What does active reading entail? We will return to this question many times in this book. For the moment, it suffices to say that, given the same thing to read, one person reads it better than another, first, by reading it more actively, and second, by performing each of the acts involved more skillfully. These two things are related. Reading is a complex activity, just as writing is. It consists of a large number of separate acts, all of which must be performed in a good reading. The person who can perform more of them is better able to read.
    
    The Activity and Art of Reading 7
    
    The Goals of Reading:
    Reading for Information
    and Reading for Understanding
    
    You have a mind. Now let us suppose that you also have a book that you want to read. The book consists of language written by someone for the sake of communicating something to you. Your success in reading it is determined by the extent to which you receive everything the writer intended to communicate.
  - |-
    That, of course, is too simple. The reason is that there are two possible relations between your mind and the book, not just one. These two relations are exemplified by two different experiences that you can have in reading your book.
    
    There is the book; and here is your mind. As you go through the pages, either you understand perfectly everything the author has to say or you do not. If you do, you may have gained information, but you could not have increased your understanding. If the book is completely intelligible to you from start to finish, then the author and you are as two minds in the same mold. The symbols on the page merely express the common understanding you had before you met.
    
    Let us take our second alternative. You do not understand the book perfectly. Let us even assume—what unhappily is not always true—that you understand enough to know that you do not understand it all. You know the book has more to say than you understand and hence that it contains something that can increase your understanding.
    
    What do you do then? You can take the book to someone else who, you think, can read better than you, and have him explain the parts that trouble you. ("He" may be a living person or another book—a commentary or textbook.) Or you may decide that what is over your head is not worth bothering about, that you understand enough. In either case, you are not doing the job of reading that the book requires.
    
    That is done in only one way. Without external help of any sort, you go to work on the book. With nothing but the power of your own mind, you operate on the symbols before you in such a way that you gradually lift yourself from a state of understanding less to one of understanding more. Such elevation, accomplished by the mind working on a book, is highly skilled reading, the kind of reading that a book which challenges your understanding deserves.

    Thus we can roughly define what we mean by the art of reading as follows: the process whereby a mind, with nothing to operate on but the symbols of the readable matter, and with no help from outside,* elevates itself by the power of its own operations. The mind passes from understanding less to understanding more. The skilled operations that cause this to happen are the various acts that constitute the art of reading.
    
    To pass from understanding less to understanding more by your own intellectual effort in reading is something like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. It certainly feels that way. It is a major exertion. Obviously, it is a more active kind of reading than you have done before, entailing not only more varied activity but also much more skill in the performance of the various acts required. Obviously, too, the things that are usually regarded as more difficult to read, and hence as only for the better reader, are those that are more likely to deserve and demand this kind of reading.
    
    The distinction between reading for information and reading for understanding is deeper than this. Let us try to say more about it. We will have to consider both goals of reading because the line between what is readable in one way and what must be read in the other is often hazy. To the extent
    
    * There is one kind of situation in which it is appropriate to ask for outside help in reading a difficult book. This exception is discussed in Chapter 18.
    
    The Activity and Art of Reading 9
    
    that we can keep these two goals of reading distinct, we can employ the word "reading" in two distinct senses.
    
    The first sense is the one in which we speak of ourselves as reading newspapers, magazines, or anything else that, according to our skill and talents, is at once thoroughly intelligible to us. Such things may increase our store of information, but they cannot improve our understanding, for our understanding was equal to them before we started. Otherwise, we would have felt the shock of puzzlement and perplexity that comes from getting in over our depth—that is, if we were both alert and honest.
  - |-
    The second sense is the one in which a person tries to read something that at first he does not completely understand. Here the thing to be read is initially better or higher than the reader. The writer is communicating something that can in-crease the reader's understanding. Such communication between unequals must be possible, or else one person could never learn from another, either through speech or writing. Here by "learning" is meant understanding more, not remem-bering more information that has the same degree of intelli-gibility as other information you already possess.
    
    There is clearly no difficulty of an intellectual sort about gaining new information in the course of reading if the new facts are of the same sort as those you already know. A person who knows some of the facts of American history and under-stands them in a certain light can readily acquire by reading, in the first sense, more such facts and understand them in the same light. But suppose he is reading a history that seeks not merely to give him some more facts but also to throw a new and perhaps more revealing light on all the facts he knows. Suppose there is greater understanding available here than he possessed before he started to read. If he can manage to acquire that greater understanding, he is reading in the second sense. He has indeed elevated himself by his activity, though indirectly, of course, the elevation was made possible by the writer who had something to teach him.
    
    10 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    What are the conditions under which this kind of reading —reading for understanding—takes place? There are two. First, there is initial inequality in understanding. The writer must be "superior" to the reader in understanding, and his book must convey in readable form the insights he possesses and his potential readers lack. Second, the reader must be able to overcome this inequality in some degree, seldom perhaps fully, but always approaching equality with the writer. To the extent that equality is approached, clarity of communication is achieved.
  - |-
    In short, we can learn only from our "betters." We must  
    know who they are and how to learn from them. The person  
    who has this sort of knowledge possesses the art of reading  
    in the sense with which we are especially concerned in this  
    book. Everyone who can read at all probably has some ability  
    to read in this way. But all of us, without exception, can learn  
    to read better and gradually gain more by our efforts through  
    applying them to more rewarding materials.
    
    We do not want to give the impression that facts, leading  
    to increased information, and insights, leading to increased  
    understanding, are always easy to distinguish, And we would  
    admit that sometimes a mere recital of facts can itself lead to  
    greater understanding. The point we want to emphasize here  
    is that this book is about the art of reading for the sake of in-  
    creased understanding. Fortunately, if you learn to do that,  
    reading for information will usually take care of itself.
    
    Of course, there is still another goal of reading, besides  
    gaining information and understanding, and that is entertain-  
    ment. However, this book will not be much concerned with  
    reading for entertainment. It is the least demanding kind of  
    reading, and it requires the least amount of effort. Further-  
    more, there are no rules for it. Everyone who knows how to  
    read at all can read for entertainment if he wants to.
    
    In fact, any book that can be read for understanding or  
    information can probably be read for entertainment as well,  
    just as a book that is capable of increasing our understanding  
    can also be read purely for the information it contains. (This  
    proposition cannot be reversed: it is not true that every book  
    that can be read for entertainment can also be read for under-  
    standing.) Nor do we wish to urge you never to read a good  
    book for entertainment. The point is, if you wish to read a good  
    book for understanding, we believe we can help you. Our sub-  
    ject, then, is the art of reading good books when understanding  
    is the aim you have in view.
    
    Reading as Learning:  
    The Difference Between Learning by Instruction  
    and Learning by Discovery
    
    Getting more information is learning, and so is coming  
    to understand what you did not understand before. But there  
    is an important difference between these two kinds of learning.

    To be informed is to know simply that something is the case. To be enlightened is to know, in addition, what it is all about: why it is the case, what its connections are with other facts, in what respects it is the same, in what respects it is different, and so forth.
    
    This distinction is familiar in terms of the differences between being able to remember something and being able to explain it. If you remember what an author says, you have learned something from reading him. If what he says is true, you have even learned something about the world. But whether it is a fact about the book or a fact about the world that you have learned, you have gained nothing but information if you have exercised only your memory. You have not been enlightened. Enlightenment is achieved only when, in addition to knowing what an author says, you know what he means and why he says it.
    
    It is true, of course, that you should be able to remember what the author said as well as know what he meant. Being informed is prerequisite to being enlightened. The point, however, is not to stop at being informed.
    
    Montaigne speaks of "an abecedarian ignorance that precedes knowledge, and a doctoral ignorance that comes after it." The first is the ignorance of those who, not knowing their ABC's, cannot read at all. The second is the ignorance of those who have misread many books. They are, as Alexander Pope rightly calls them, bookful blockheads, ignorantly read. There have always been literate ignoramuses who have read too widely and not well. The Greeks had a name for such a mixture of learning and folly which might be applied to the bookish but poorly read of all ages. They are all sophomores.
    
    To avoid this error—the error of assuming that to be widely read and to be well-read are the same thing—we must consider a certain distinction in types of learning. This distinction has a significant bearing on the whole business of reading and its relation to education generally.
  - |-
    In the history of education, men have often distinguished between learning by instruction and learning by discovery. Instruction occurs when one person teaches another through speech or writing. We can, however, gain knowledge without being taught. If this were not the case, and every teacher had to be taught what he in turn teaches others, there would be no beginning in the acquisition of knowledge. Hence, there must be discovery—the process of learning something by research, by investigation, or by reflection, without being taught.
    
    Discovery stands to instruction as learning without a teacher stands to learning through the help of one. In both cases, the activity of learning goes on in the one who learns. It would be a mistake to suppose that discovery is active learning and instruction passive. There is no inactive learning, just as there is no inactive reading.
    
    This is so true, in fact, that a better way to make the distinction clear is to call instruction "aided discovery." Without going into learning theory as psychologists conceive it, it is obvious that teaching is a very special art, sharing with only two other arts—agriculture and medicine—an exceptionally important characteristic. A doctor may do many things for his patient, but in the final analysis it is the patient himself who must get well—grow in health. The farmer does many things for his plants or animals, but in the final analysis it is they that must grow in size and excellence. Similarly, although the teacher may help his student in many ways, it is the student himself who must do the learning. Knowledge must grow in his mind if learning is to take place.
  - |-
    The difference between learning by instruction and learning by discovery—or, as we would prefer to say, between aided and unaided discovery—is primarily a difference in the materials on which the learner works. When he is being instructed—discovering with the help of a teacher—the learner acts on something communicated to him. He performs operations on discourse, written or oral. He learns by acts of reading or listening. Note here the close relation between reading and listening. If we ignore the minor differences between these two ways of receiving communication, we can say that reading and listening are the same art—the art of being taught. When, however, the learner proceeds without the help of any sort of teacher, the operations of learning are performed on nature or the world rather than on discourse. The rules of such learning constitute the art of unaided discovery. If we use the word "reading" loosely, we can say that discovery—strictly, unaided discovery—is the art of reading nature or the world, as instruction (being taught, or aided discovery) is the art of reading books or, to include listening, of learning from discourse.
    
    What about thinking? If by "thinking" we mean the use of our minds to gain knowledge or understanding, and if learning by discovery and learning by instruction exhaust the ways of gaining knowledge, then thinking must take place during both of these two activities. We must think in the course of reading and listening, just as we must think in the course of research. Naturally, the kinds of thinking are different—as different as the two ways of learning are.
    
    The reason why many people regard thinking as more closely associated with research and unaided discovery than with being taught is that they suppose reading and listening to be relatively effortless. It is probably true that one does less thinking when one reads for information or entertainment than when one is undertaking to discover something. Those are the less active sorts of reading. But it is not true of the more active reading—the effort to understand. No one who has done this sort of reading would say it can be done thoughtlessly.

    Thinking is only one part of the activity of learning. One must also use one's senses and imagination. One must observe, and remember, and construct imaginatively what cannot be observed. There is, again, a tendency to stress the role of these activities in the process of unaided discovery and to forget or minimize their place in the process of being taught through reading or listening. For example, many people assume that though a poet must use his imagination in writing a poem, they do not have to use their imagination in reading it. The art of reading, in short, includes all of the same skills that are involved in the art of unaided discovery: keenness of observation, readily available memory, range of imagination, and, of course, an intellect trained in analysis and reflection. The reason for this is that reading in this sense is discovery, too—although with help instead of without it.
    
    Present and Absent Teachers
    
    We have been proceeding as if reading and listening could both be treated as learning from teachers. To some extent that is true. Both are ways of being instructed, and for both one must be skilled in the art of being taught. Listening to a course of lectures, for example, is in many respects like reading a book; and listening to a poem is like reading it. Many of the rules to be formulated in this book apply to such experiences. Yet there is good reason to place primary emphasis on reading, and let listening become a secondary concern. The reason is that listening is learning from a teacher who is present—a living teacher—while reading is learning from one who is absent.
    
    The Activity and Art of Reading 15
    
    If you ask a living teacher a question, he will probably answer you. If you are puzzled by what he says, you can save yourself the trouble of thinking by asking him what he means. If, however, you ask a book a question, you must answer it yourself. In this respect a book is like nature or the world. When you question it, it answers you only to the extent that you do the work of thinking and analysis yourself.
  - |-
    This does not mean, of course, that if the living teacher answers your question, you have no further work. That is so only if the question is simply one of fact. But if you are seeking an explanation, you have to understand it or nothing has been explained to you. Nevertheless, with the living teacher available to you, you are given a lift in the direction of understanding him, as you are not when the teacher's words in a book are all you have to go by.
    
    Students in school often read difficult books with the help and guidance of teachers. But for those of us who are not in school, and indeed also for those of us who are when we try to read books that are not required or assigned, our continuing education depends mainly on books alone, read without a teacher's help. Therefore if we are disposed to go on learning and discovering, we must know how to make books teach us well. That, indeed, is the primary goal of this book.
    
    2
    THE LEVELS OF READING
    
    In the preceding chapter, we made some distinctions that will be important in what follows. The goal a reader seeks—be it entertainment, information or understanding—determines the way he reads. The effectiveness with which he reads is determined by the amount of effort and skill he puts into his reading. In general, the rule is: the more effort the better, at least in the case of books that are initially beyond our powers as readers and are therefore capable of raising us from a condition of understanding less to one of understanding more. Finally, the distinction between instruction and discovery (or between aided and unaided discovery) is important because most of us, most of the time, have to read without anyone to help us. Reading, like unaided discovery, is learning from an absent teacher. We can only do that successfully if we know how.
    
    But important as these distinctions are, they are relatively insignificant compared to the points we are going to make in this chapter. These all have to do with the levels of reading. The differences between the levels must be understood before any effective improvement in reading skills can occur.
  - |-
    There are four levels of reading. They are here called  
    levels rather than kinds because kinds, strictly speaking, are  
    distinct from one another, whereas it is characteristic of levels  
    that higher ones include lower ones. So it is with the levels of  
    reading, which are cumulative. The first level is not lost in  
    
    16  
    The Levels of Reading 17
    
    the second, the second in the third, the third in the fourth. In  
    fact, the fourth and highest level of reading includes all the  
    others. It simply goes beyond them.
    
    The first level of reading we will call Elementary Reading. Other names might be rudimentary reading, basic reading or  
    initial reading; any one of these terms serves to suggest that as  
    one masters this level one passes from nonliteracy to at least  
    beginning literacy. In mastering this level, one learns the  
    rudiments of the art of reading, receives basic training in read-  
    ing, and acquires initial reading skills. We prefer the name  
    elementary reading, however, because this level of reading is  
    ordinarily learned in elementary school.
    
    The child's first encounter with reading is at this level. His problem then (and ours when we began to read) is to  
    recognize the individual words on the page. The child sees a  
    collection of black marks on a white ground (or perhaps white  
    marks on a black ground, if he is reading from a blackboard ); what the marks say is, "The cat sat on the hat." The first  
    grader is not really concerned at this point with whether cats  
    do sit on hats, or with what this implies about cats, hats, and  
    the world. He is merely concerned with language as it is em-  
    ployed by the writer.
    
    At this level of reading, the question asked of the reader is  
    "What does the sentence say?" That could be conceived as a  
    complex and difficult question, of course. We mean it here,  
    however, in its simplest sense.
  - |-
    The attainment of the skills of elementary reading occurred some time ago for almost all who read this book.
    Nevertheless, we continue to experience the problems of this level of reading, no matter how capable we may be as readers.
    This happens, for example, whenever we come upon something we want to read that is written in a foreign language that we
    do not know very well. Then our first effort must be to iden-
    tify the actual words. Only after recognizing them individually
    can we begin to try to understand them, to struggle with per-
    ceiving what they mean.
    
    18 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    Even when they are reading material written in their own
    language,. many readers continue to have various kinds of
    difficulties at this level of reading. Most of these difficulties
    are mechanical, and some of them can be traced back to early
    instruction in reading. Overcoming these difficulties usually
    allows us to read faster; hence, most speed reading courses
    concentrate on this level. We will have more to say about
    elementary reading in the next chapter; and in Chapter 4, we
    will discuss speed reading.
    
    The second level of reading we will call Inspectional
    Reading. It is characterized by its special emphasis on time.
    When reading at this level, the student is allowed a set time to
    complete an assigned amount of reading. He might be allowed
    fifteen minutes to read this book, for instance—or even a book
    twice as long.
    
    Hence, another way to describe this level of reading is to
    say that its aim is to get the most out of a book within a given
    time—usually a relatively short time, and always (by defini-
    tion) too short a time to get out of the book everything that
    can be gotten.
    
    Still another name for this level might be skimming or
    pre-reading. However, we do not mean the kind of skimming
    that is characterized by casual or random browsing through a
    book. Inspectional reading is the art of skimming systemati-
    cally.
    
    When reading at this level, your aim is to examine the
    surface of the book, to learn everything that the surface alone
    can teach you. That is often a good deal.

    Whereas the question that is asked at the first level is  
    "What does the sentence say?" the question typically asked at  
    this level is "What is the book about?" That is a surface  
    question; others of a similar nature are "What is the structure  
    of the book?" or "What are its parts?"
    
    Upon completing an inspectional reading of a book, no  
    matter how short the time you had to do it in, you should also  
    be able to answer the question, "What kind of book is it—a  
    novel, a history, a scientific treatise?"
    
    The Levels of Reading 19
    
    Chapter 4 is devoted to an account of this level of reading,  
    so we will not discuss it further here. We do want to stress,  
    however, that most people, even many quite good readers, are  
    unaware of the value of inspectional reading. They start a book  
    on page one and plow steadily through it, without even reading  
    the table of contents. They are thus faced with the task of  
    achieving a superficial knowledge of the book at the same time  
    that they are trying to understand it. That compounds the  
    difficulty.
    
    The third level of reading we will call Analytical Reading.  
    It is both a more complex and a more systematic activity than  
    either of the two levels of reading discussed so far. Depending  
    on the difficulty of the text to be read, it makes more or less  
    heavy demands on the reader.
    
    Analytical reading is thorough reading, complete reading,  
    or good reading—the best reading you can do. If inspectional  
    reading is the best and most complete reading that is possible  
    given a limited time, then analytical reading is the best and  
    most complete reading that is possible given unlimited time.
  - |-
    The analytical reader must ask many, and organized, questions of what he is reading. We do not want to state these questions here, since this book is mainly about reading at this level: Part Two gives its rules and tells you how to do it. We do want to emphasize here that analytical reading is always intensely active. On this level of reading, the reader grasps a book—the metaphor is apt—and works at it until the book becomes his own. Francis Bacon once remarked that "some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested." Reading a book analytically is chewing and digesting it.
    
    We also want to stress that analytical reading is hardly ever necessary if your goal in reading is simply information or entertainment. Analytical reading is preeminently for the sake of understanding. Conversely, bringing your mind with the aid of a book from a condition of understanding less to one of understanding more is almost impossible unless you have at least some skill in analytical reading.
    
    The fourth and highest level of reading we will call Syntopical Reading. It is the most complex and systematic type of reading of all. It makes very heavy demands on the reader, even if the materials he is reading are themselves relatively easy and unsophisticated.
    
    Another name for this level might be comparative reading. When reading syntopically, the reader reads many books, not just one, and places them in relation to one another and to a subject about which they all revolve. But mere comparison of texts is not enough. Syntopical reading involves more. With the help of the books read, the syntopical reader is able to construct an analysis of the subject that may not be in any of the books. It is obvious, therefore, that syntopical reading is the most active and effortful kind of reading.
  - |-
    We will discuss syntopical reading in Part Four. Let it
    suffice for the moment to say that syntopical reading is not an
    easy art, and that the rules for it are not widely known. Never-
    theless, syntopical reading is probably the most rewarding of
    all reading activities. The benefits are so great that it is well
    worth the trouble of learning how to do it.

    THE FIRST LEVEL OF READING:
    ELEMENTARY READING
    
    Ours is a time of great interest in and concern about reading.
    Public officials have declared that the 1970's will be "the decade
    of reading." Best-selling books tell us why Johnny can or can't
    read. Research and experimentation in all fields of initial read-
    ing instruction proceed at an ever-increasing pace.
    
    Three historical trends or movements have converged
    upon our time to produce this ferment. The first is the con-
    tinuing effort of the United States to educate all of its citizens,
    which means, of course, at a minimum, to make them all
    literate. This effort, which Americans have supported almost
    from the beginning of the national existence and which is one
    of the cornerstones of our democratic way of life, has had
    remarkable results. Near-universal literacy was obtained in
    the United States earlier than anywhere else, and this in turn
    has helped us to become the highly developed industrial
    society that we are at the present day. But there have been
    enormous problems, too. They can be summed up in the ob-
    servation that teaching a small percentage of highly motivated
    children, most of them the children of literate parents, to read
    —as was the case a century ago—is a far cry from teaching
    every child to read, no matter how little motivated he may be,
    or how deprived his background.
    
    The second historical trend is in the teaching of reading

    Itself. As late as 1870, reading instruction was little changed
    from what it had been in Greek and Roman schools. In Amer-
    ica, at least, the so-called ABC method was dominant through-
    out most of the nineteenth century. Children were taught to
    sound out the letters of the alphabet individually—hence the
    name of this method—and to combine them in syllables, first
    two letters at a time and then three and four, whether the
    syllables so constructed were meaningful or not. Thus, syllables
    such as ab, ac, ad, ib, ic were practiced for the sake of mastery
    of the language. When a child could name all of a determined
    number of combinations, he was said to know his ABC's.
    
    This synthetic method of teaching reading came under
    heavy criticism around the middle of the last century, and two
    alternatives to it were proposed. One was a variant on the
    synthetic ABC method, known as the phonic method. Here the
    word was recognized by its sounds rather than by its letter-
    names. Complicated and ingenious systems of printing were
    evolved for the purpose of representing the different sounds
    made by a single letter, especially the vowels. If you are fifty
    or over, it is probable that you learned to read using some
    variant of the phonic method.
    
    A wholly different approach, analytical rather than syn-
    thetic, originated in Germany and was advocated by Horace
    Mann and other educators after about 1840. This involved
    teaching the visual recognition of whole words before giving
    any attention to letter-names or letter-sounds. This so-called
    sight method was later extended so that whole sentences,
    representing units of thought, were introduced first, with the
    pupils only later learning to recognize the constituent words
    and then, finally, the constituent letters. This method was
    especially popular during the 1920's and 30's, which period was
    also characterized by the shift in emphasis from oral reading
    to silent reading. It was found that ability to read orally did
    not necessarily mean ability to read silently and that instruc-
    tion in oral reading was not always adequate if silent reading
    was the goal. Thus, an almost exclusive emphasis on rapid,

    comprehensive silent reading was a feature of the years from
    about 1920 to 1925. More recently, however, the pendulum has
    swung back again toward phonics, which indeed had never
    entirely left the curriculum.
    
    All of these different methods of teaching elementary read-
    ing were successful for some pupils, unsuccessful for others.
    In the last two or three decades, it has perhaps been the
    failures that have attracted the most attention. And here the
    third historical trend comes into play. It is traditional in Amer-
    ica to criticize the schools; for more than a century, parents,
    self-styled experts, and educators themselves have attacked
    and indicted the educational system. No aspect of schooling
    has been more severely criticized than reading instruction.
    The current books have a long ancestry, and every innovation
    carries in its train a posse of suspicious and, one feels, un-
    persuadable observers.
    
    The critics may or may not be right, but in any event the
    problems have taken on a new urgency as the continuing effort
    to educate all citizens has entered a new phase, resulting in
    ever-growing high school and college populations. A young
    man or woman who cannot read very well is hindered in his
    pursuit of the American dream, but that remains largely a
    personal matter if he is not in school. If he remains in school
    or goes to college, however, it is a matter of concern for his
    teachers as well, and for his fellow students.
    
    Hence, researchers are very active at the present time,
    and their work has resulted in numerous new approaches to
    reading instruction. Among the more important new programs
    are the so-called eclectic approach, the individualized reading
    approach, the language-experience approach, the various ap-
    proaches based on linguistic principles, and others based more
    or less closely on some kind of programmed instruction. In
    addition, new mediums such as the Initial Teaching Alphabet
    (i.t.a.) have been employed, and sometimes these involve new
    methods as well. Still other devices and programs are the
    "total immersion method," the "foreign-language-school"

    "method," and the method known variously as the "see-say,"
    "look-say," "look-and-say," or "word method." Doubtless ex-
    periments are now being undertaken in methods and ap-
    proaches that differ from all of these. It is perhaps too early
    to tell whether any of these is the long-sought panacea for
    all reading ills.
    
    Stages of Learning to Read
    
    One useful finding of recent research is the analysis of
    stages in learning to read. It is now widely accepted that there
    are at least four more or less clearly distinguishable stages in
    the child's progress toward what is called mature reading
    ability. The first stage is known by the term "reading readi-
    ness." This begins, it has been pointed out, at birth, and con-
    tinues normally until the age of about six or seven.
    
    Reading readiness includes several different kinds of prep-
    aration for learning to read. Physical readiness involves good
    vision and hearing. Intellectual readiness involves a minimum
    level of visual perception such that the child can take in and
    remember an entire word and the letters that combine to form
    it. Language readiness involves the ability to speak clearly and
    to use several sentences in correct order. Personal readiness
    involves the ability to work with other children, to sustain at-
    tention, to follow directions, and the like.
    
    General reading readiness is assessed by tests and is also
    estimated by teachers who are often skillful at discerning just
    when a pupil is ready to learn to read. The important thing to
    remember is that jumping the gun is usually self-defeating.
    The child who is not yet ready to read is frustrated if attempts
    are made to teach him, and he may carry over his dislike for
    the experience into his later school career and even into adult
    life. Delaying the beginning of reading instruction beyond the
    reading readiness stage is not nearly so serious, despite the
    feelings of parents who may fear that their child is "back-
    ward" or is not "keeping up" with his peers.
    
    The First Level of Reading: Elementary Reading 25
  - |-
    In the second stage, children learn to read very simple materials. They usually begin, at least in the United States, by learning a few sight words, and typically manage to master perhaps three hundred to four hundred words by the end of the first year. Basic skills are introduced at this time, such as the use of context or meaning clues and the beginning sounds of words. By the end of this period pupils are expected to be reading simple books independently and with enthusiasm.
    
    It is incidentally worth observing that something quite mysterious, almost magical, occurs during this stage. At one moment in the course of his development the child, when faced with a series of symbols on a page, finds them quite meaningless. Not much later—perhaps only two or three weeks later—he has discovered meaning in them; he knows that they say "The cat sat on the hat." How this happens no one really knows, despite the efforts of philosophers and psychologists over two and a half millennia to study the phenomenon. Where does meaning come from? How is it that a French child would find the same meaning in the symbols "Le chat s‘asseyait sur le chapeau"? Indeed, this discovery of meaning in symbols may be the most astounding intellectual feat that any human being ever performs—and most humans perform it before they are seven years old!
    
    The third stage is characterized by rapid progress in vocabulary building and by increasing skill in "unlocking" the meaning of unfamiliar words through context clues. In addition, children at this stage learn to read for different purposes and in different areas of content, such as science, social studies, language arts, and the like. They learn that reading, besides being something one does at school, is also something one can do on one's own, for fun, to satisfy curiosity, or even to "expand one's horizons."
    
    Finally, the fourth stage is characterized by the refinement and enhancement of the skills previously acquired. Above all, the student begins to be able to assimilate his reading experiences—that is, to carry over concepts from one piece of writing to another, and to compare the views of different writers on
  - |-
    The same subject. This, the mature stage of reading, should be
    reached by young persons in their early teens. Ideally, they
    should continue to build on it for the rest of their lives.
    
    That they often do not even reach it is apparent to many
    parents and to most educators. The reasons for the failure are
    many, ranging all the way from various kinds of deprivations
    in the home environment—economic, social, and/or intellectual
    (including parental illiteracy )—to personal problems of all
    kinds (including total revolt against "the system"). But one
    cause of the failure is not often noted. The very emphasis on
    reading readiness and on the methods employed to teach
    children the rudiments of reading has meant that the other,
    the higher, levels of reading have tended to be slighted. This
    is quite understandable, considering the urgency and extent
    of the problems found on this first level. Nevertheless, effec-
    tive remedies for the overall reading deficiencies of Americans
    cannot be found unless efforts are made on all levels of reading.
    
    Stages and Levels
    
    We have described four levels of reading, and we have
    also outlined four stages of learning to read in an elementary
    fashion. What is the relation between these stages and levels?
    
    It is of paramount importance to recognize that the four
    stages outlined here are all stages of the first level of reading,
    as outlined in the previous chapter. They are stages, that is,
    of elementary reading, which thus can be usefully divided
    somewhat in the manner of the elementary school curriculum.
    The first stage of elementary reading—reading readiness—cor-
    responds to pre-school and kindergarten experiences. The
    second stage—word mastery—corresponds to the first grade
    experience of the typical child (although many quite normal
    children are not "typical" in this sense), with the result that
    the child attains what we can call second-stage reading skills,
    or first grade ability in reading or first grade literacy. The
  - |-
    Third stage of elementary reading—vocabulary growth and the utilization of context—is typically (but not universally, even for normal children) acquired at about the end of the fourth grade of elementary school, and results in what is variously called fourth grade, or functional, literacy—the ability, according to one common definition, to read traffic signs or picture captions fairly easily, to fill out the simpler government forms, and the like. The fourth and final stage of elementary reading is attained at about the time the pupil leaves or graduates from elementary school or junior high school. It is sometimes called eighth grade, ninth grade, or tenth grade literacy. The child is a "mature" reader in the sense that he is now capable of reading almost anything, but still in a relatively unsophisticated manner. In the simplest terms, he is mature enough to do high school work.
    
    However, he is not yet a "mature" reader in the sense in which we want to employ the term in this book. He has mastered the first level of reading, that is all; he can read on his own and is prepared to learn more about reading. But he does not yet know how to read beyond the elementary level.
    
    We mention all this because it is highly germane to the message of this book. We assume—we must assume—that you, our reader, have attained ninth grade literacy, that you have mastered the elementary level of reading, which means that you have passed successfully through the four stages described. If you think about it, you realize that we could not assume less. No one can learn from a how-to-do-it book until he can read it; and it is particularly true of a book purporting to teach one to read that its readers must be able to read in some sense of the term.
    
    The difference between aided and unaided discovery comes into play here. Typically, the four stages of elementary reading are attained with the help of living teachers. Children differ in their abilities, of course; some need more help than others. But a teacher is usually present to answer questions and smooth over difficulties that arise during the elementary

     school years. Only when he has mastered all of the four stages
    of elementary reading is the child prepared to move on to the
    higher levels of reading. Only then can he read independently
    and learn on his own. Only then can he begin to become a
    really good reader.
    
    Higher Levels of Reading
    and Higher Education
    
    Traditionally, the high schools of America have provided
    little reading instruction for their students, and the colleges
    have provided none. That situation has changed in recent
    years. Two generations ago, when high school enrollments in-
    creased greatly within a relatively short period, educators be-
    gan to realize that it could no longer be assumed that entering
    students could read effectively. Remedial reading instruction
    was therefore provided, sometimes for as many as 75% or
    more students. Within the last decade, the same situation has
    occurred at the college level. Thus, of approximately 40,000
    freshmen entering the City University of New York in the fall
    of 1971, upwards of half, or more than 20,000 young people,
    had to be given some kind of remedial training in reading.
    
    That does not mean, however, that reading instruction be-
    yond the elementary level is offered in many U.S. colleges to
    this day. In fact, it is offered in almost none of them. Remedial
    reading instruction is not instruction in the higher levels of
    reading. It serves only to bring students up to a level of matur-
    ity in reading that they should have attained by the time they
    graduated from elementary school. To this day, most institu-
    tions of higher learning either do not know how to instruct
    students in reading beyond the elementary level, or lack the
    facilities and personnel to do so.
    
    We say this despite the fact that a number of four-year
    and community colleges have recently instituted courses in
    speed reading, or in "effective" reading, or "competence" in
    reading. On the whole (though there are exceptions), these
    courses are remedial. They are designed to overcome various
    kinds of failures of the lower schools. They are not designed
    to take the student beyond the first level or to introduce him
    to the kinds and levels of reading that are the main subject of
    this book.
  - |-
    This, of course, should not be the case. A good liberal arts high school, if it does nothing else, ought to produce graduates who are competent analytical readers. A good college, if it does nothing else, ought to produce competent syntopical readers. A college degree ought to represent general competence in reading such that a graduate could read any kind of material for general readers and be able to undertake independent research on almost any subject (for that is what syntopical reading, among other things, enables you to do). Often, however, three or four years of graduate study are required before students attain this level of reading ability, and they do not always attain it even then.
    
    One should not have to spend four years in graduate school in order to learn how to read. Four years of graduate school, in addition to twelve years of preparatory education and four years of college—that adds up to twenty full years of schooling. It should not take that long to learn to read. Something is very wrong if it does.
    
    What is wrong can be corrected. Courses could be instituted in many high schools and colleges that are based on the program described in this book. There is nothing arcane or even really new about what we have to propose. It is largely common sense.
    
    Reading and the Democratic Ideal of Education
    
    We do not want to seem to be mere carping critics. We know that the thunder of thousands of freshmen feet upon the stairs makes it hard to hear, no matter how reasonable the message. And as long as a large proportion, even a majority, of these new students cannot read effectively at the elementary level, we are aware that the first task to be faced must be to teach them to read in the lowest, the largest common-denominator, sense of the term.
    
    Nor, for the moment, would we want it any other way. We are on record as holding that unlimited educational opportunity—or, speaking practically, educational opportunity that is limited only by individual desire, ability, and need—is the most valuable service that society can provide for its members. That we do not yet know how to provide that kind of opportunity is no reason to give up the attempt.
  - |-
    But we must also realize—students, teachers, and laymen
    alike—that even when we have accomplished the task that
    lies before us, we will not have accomplished the whole task.
    We must be more than a nation of functional literates. We
    must become a nation of truly competent readers, recognizing
    all that the word competent implies. Nothing less will satisfy
    the needs of the world that is coming.

    THE SECOND LEVEL OF READING:
    INSPECTIONAL READING
    
    Inspectional reading is a true level of reading. It is quite
    distinct from the level that precedes it (elementary reading)
    and from the one that follows it in natural sequence (ana-
    lytical reading). But, as we noted in Chapter 2, the levels of
    reading are cumulative. Thus, elementary reading is contained
    in inspectional reading, as, indeed, inspectional reading is con-
    tained in analytical reading, and analytical reading in syntopi-
    cal reading.
    
    Practically, this means that you cannot read on the in-
    spectional level unless you can read effectively on the ele-
    mentary level. You must be able to read an author's text more
    or less steadily, without having to stop to look up the mean-
    ing of many words, and without stumbling over the grammar
    and syntax. You must be able to make sense of a majority of
    the sentences and paragraphs, although not necessarily the
    best sense of all of them.
    
    What, then, is involved in inspectional reading? How do
    you go about doing it?
    
    The first thing to realize is that there are two types of
    inspectional reading. They are aspects of a single skill, but
    the beginning reader is well-advised to consider them as two
    different steps or activities. The experienced reader learns to
    
    31
    
    32 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    perform both steps simultaneously, but for the moment we will
    treat them as if they were quite distinct.
    
    Inspectional Reading |:
    Systematic Skimming or Pre-reading
    
    Let us return to the basic situation to which we have re-
    ferred before. There is a book or other reading matter, and
    here is your mind. What is the first thing that you do?
  - |-
    Let us assume two further elements in the situation, elements that are quite common. First, you do not know whether you want to read the book. You do not know whether it deserves an analytical reading. But you suspect that it does, or at least that it contains both information and insights that would be valuable to you if you could dig them out.
    
    Second, let us assume—and this is very often the case—that you have only a limited time in which to find all this out.
    
    In this case, what you must do is skim the book, or, as some prefer to say, pre-read it. Skimming or pre-reading is the first sublevel of inspectional reading. Your main aim is to discover whether the book requires a more careful reading. Secondly, skimming can tell you lots of other things about the book, even if you decide not to read it again with more care.
    
    Giving a book this kind of quick once-over is a threshing process that helps you to separate the chaff from the real kernels of nourishment. You may discover that what you get from skimming is all the book is worth to you for the time being. It may never be worth more. But you will know at least what the author's main contention is, as well as what kind of book he has written, so the time you have spent looking through the book will not have been wasted.
    
    The habit of skimming should not take much time to acquire. Here are some suggestions about how to do it.
    
    Look at the title page and, if the book has one, at its preface. Read each quickly. Note especially the subtitles or
    The Second Level of Reading: Inspectional Reading 33
    
    other indications of the scope or aim of the book or of the author's special angle on his subject. Before completing this step you should have a good idea of the subject, and, if you wish, you may pause for a moment to place the book in the appropriate category in your mind. What pigeonhole that already contains other books does this one belong in?
  - |-
    2. STUDY THE TABLE OF CONTENTS to obtain a general sense  
    of the book's structure; use it as you would a road map before  
    taking a trip. It is astonishing how many people never even  
    glance at a book's table of contents unless they wish to look  
    something up in it. In fact, many authors spend a considerable  
    amount of time in creating the table of contents, and it is sad,  
    to think their efforts are often wasted.
    
    It used to be a common practice, especially in expository  
    works, but sometimes even in novels and poems, to write very  
    full tables of contents, with the chapters or parts broken down  
    into many subtitles indicative of the topics covered. Milton,  
    for example, wrote more or less lengthy headings, or "Argu-  
    ments," as he called them, for each book of Paradise Lost.  
    Gibbon published his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire  
    with an extensive analytical table of contents for each chapter.  
    Such summaries are no longer common, although occasionally  
    you do still come across an analytical table of contents. One  
    reason for the decline of the practice may be that people are  
    not so likely to read tables of contents as they once were. Also,  
    publishers have come to feel that a less revealing table of con-  
    tents is more seductive than a completely frank and open one.  
    Readers, they feel, will be attracted to a book with more or  
    less mysterious chapter titles—they will want to read the book  
    to find out what the chapters are about. Even so, a table of  
    contents can be valuable, and you should read it carefully  
    before going on to the rest of the book.
    
    At this point, you might turn back to the table of contents  
    of this book, if you have not already read it. We tried to make  
    it as full and informative as we could. Examining it should  
    give you a good idea of what we are trying to do.
    
    34 HOW TO READ A BOOK
  - |-
    3. CHECK THE INDEX if the book has one—most expository
    works do. Make a quick estimate of the range of topics covered
    and of the kinds of books and authors referred to. When you
    see terms listed that seem crucial, look up at least some of the
    passages cited. (We will have much more to say about crucial
    terms in Part Two. Here you must make your judgment of their
    importance on the basis of your general sense of the book, as
    obtained from steps 1 and 2.) The passages you read may
    contain the crux—the point on which the book hinges—or the
    new departure which is the key to the author's approach and
    attitude.
    
    As in the case of the table of contents, you might at this
    point check the index of this book. You will recognize as cru-
    cial some terms that have already been discussed. Can you
    identify, for example, by the number of references under them,
    any others that also seem important?
    
    4. If the book is a new one with a dust jacket, READ THE
    PUBLISHER'S BLURB. Some people have the impression that the
    blurb is never anything but sheer puffery. But this is quite
    often not true, especially in the case of expository works. The
    blurbs of many of these books are written by the authors them-
    selves, admittedly with the help of the publisher's public rela-
    tions department. It is not uncommon for authors to try to
    summarize as accurately as they can the main points in their
    book. These efforts should not go unnoticed. Of course, if the
    blurb is nothing but a puff for the book, you will ordinarily be
    able to discover this at a glance. But that in itself can tell you
    something about the work. Perhaps the book does not say
    anything of importance—and that is why the blurb does not
    say anything, either.
    
    Upon completing these first four steps you may already
    have enough information about the book to know that you
    want to read it more carefully, or that you do not want or need
    to read it at all. In either case, you may put it aside for the
    moment. If you do not do so, you are now ready to skim the
    book, properly speaking.
  - |-
    5. From your general and still rather vague knowledge  
    of the book's contents, LOOK NOW AT THE CHAPTERS THAT SEEM  
    TO BE PIVOTAL TO ITS ARGUMENT. If these chapters have sum-  
    mary statements in their opening or closing pages, as they often  
    do, read these statements carefully.
    
    6. Finally, TURN THE PAGES, DIPPING IN HERE AND THERE,  
    READING A PARAGRAPH OR TWO, SOMETIMES SEVERAL PAGES IN  
    SEQUENCE, NEVER MORE THAN THAT. Thumb through the book  
    in this way, always looking for signs of the main contention,  
    listening for the basic pulsebeat of the matter. Above all, do  
    not fail to read the last two or three pages, or, if these are an  
    epilogue, the last few pages of the main part of the book. Few  
    authors are able to resist the temptation to sum up what they  
    think is new and important about their work in these pages.  
    You do not want to miss this, even though, as sometimes hap-  
    pens, the author himself may be wrong in his judgment.
    
    You have now skimmed the book systematically; you have  
    given it the first type of inspectional reading. You should know  
    a good deal about the book at this point, after having spent no  
    more than a few minutes, at most an hour, with it. In par-  
    ticular, you should know whether the book contains matter  
    that you still want to dig out, or whether it deserves no more  
    of your time and attention. You should also be able to place  
    the book even more accurately than before in your mental card  
    catalogue, for further reference if the occasion should ever  
    arise.
    
    Incidentally, this is a very active sort of reading. It is im-  
    possible to give any book an inspectional reading without being  
    alert, without having all of one's faculties awake and work-  
    ing. How many times have you daydreamed through several  
    pages of a good book only to wake up to the realization that  
    you have no idea of the ground you have gone over? That  
    cannot happen if you follow the steps outlined here—that is,  
    if you have a system for following a general thread.
    
    Think of yourself as a detective looking for clues to a

    book's general theme or idea, alert for anything that will make
    it clearer. Heeding the suggestions we have made will help you
    sustain this attitude. You will be surprised to find out how
    much time you will save, pleased to see how much more you
    will grasp, and relieved to discover how much easier it all can
    
    be than you supposed.
    
    Inspectional Reading I:
    Superficial Reading
    
    The title of this section is intentionally provocative. The
    word "superficial" ordinarily has a negative connotation. We
    are quite serious, however, in using the term.
    
    Everyone has had the experience of struggling fruitlessly
    with a difficult book that was begun with high hopes of en-
    lightenment. It is natural enough to conclude that it was a
    mistake to try to read it in the first place. But that was not the
    mistake. Rather it was in expecting too much from the first
    going over of a difficult book. Approached in the right way,
    no book intended for the general reader, no matter how diff-
    cult, need be a cause for despair.
    
    What is the right approach? The answer lies in an im-
    portant and helpful rule of reading that is generally overlooked.
    That rule is simply this: In tackling a difficult book for the first
    time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or
    ponder the things you do not understand right away.
    
    Pay attention to what you can understand and do not be
    stopped by what you cannot immediately grasp. Go right on
    reading past the point where you have difficulties in under-
    standing, and you will soon come to things you do understand.
    Concentrate on these. Keep on in this way. Read the book
    through, undeterred and undismayed by the paragraphs, foot-
    notes, comments, and references that escape you. If you let
    yourself get stalled, if you allow yourself to be tripped up by
    any one of these stumbling blocks, you are lost. In most cases,
    The Second Level of Reading: Inspectional Reading 37
    
    you will not be able to puzzle the thing out by sticking to it.
    You will have a much better chance of understanding it on a
    second reading, but that requires you to have read the book
    through at least once.
  - |-
    What you understand by reading the book through to the end—even if it is only fifty percent or less—will help you when you make the additional effort later to go back to the places you passed by on your first reading. And even if you never go back, understanding half of a really tough book is much better than not understanding it at all, which will be the case if you allow yourself to be stopped by the first difficult passage you come to.
    
    Most of us were taught to pay attention to the things we did not understand. We were told to go to a dictionary when we met an unfamiliar word. We were told to go to an encyclopedia or some other reference work when we were confronted with allusions or statements we did not comprehend. We were told to consult footnotes, scholarly commentaries, or other secondary sources to get help. But when these things are done prematurely, they only impede our reading, instead of helping it.
    
    The tremendous pleasure that can come from reading Shakespeare, for instance, was spoiled for generations of high school students who were forced to go through Julius Caesar, As You Like It, or Hamlet, scene by scene, looking up all the strange words in a glossary and studying all the scholarly footnotes. As a result, they never really read a Shakespearean play. By the time they reached the end, they had forgotten the beginning and lost sight of the whole. Instead of being forced to take this pedantic approach, they should have been encouraged to read the play at one sitting and discuss what they got out of that first quick reading. Only then would they have been ready to study the play carefully and closely because then they would have understood enough of it to learn more.
    
    The rule applies with equal force to expository works. Here, indeed, the best proof of the soundness of the rule—give
  - |-
    A book, a first superficial reading~is what happens when you do not follow it. Take a basic work in economics, for example, such as Adam Smith's classic The Wealth of Nations. (We choose this book as an example because it is more than a textbook or a work for specialists in the field. It is a book for the general reader.) If you insist on understanding everything on every page before you go on to the next, you will not get very far. In your effort to master the fine points, you will miss the big points that Smith makes so clearly about the factors of wages, rents, profits, and interest that enter into the cost of things, the role of the market in determining prices, the evils of monopoly, the reasons for free trade. You will miss the forest for the trees. You will not be reading well on any level.
    
    On Reading Speeds
    
    We described inspectional reading in Chapter 2 as the art of getting the most out of a book in a limited time. In describing it further in the present chapter, we have in no way changed that definition. The two steps involved in inspectional reading are both taken rapidly. The competent inspectional reader will accomplish them both quickly, no matter how long or difficult the book he is trying to read.
    
    That working definition, however, inevitably raises the question, What about speed reading? What is the relation between the levels of reading and the many speed reading courses, both academic and commercial, that are offered at the present day?
    
    We have already suggested that such courses are basically remedial—that is, that they provide instruction mainly, if not exclusively, in reading on the elementary level. But more needs to be said.
    
    Let it be understood at once that we are wholly in favor of the proposition that most people ought to be able to read faster than they do. Too often, there are things we have to read

    that are not really worth spending a lot of time reading; if we
    cannot read them quickly, it will be a terrible waste of time.
    It is true enough that many people read some things too slowly,
    and that they ought to read them faster. But many people also
    read some things too fast, and they ought to read those things
    more slowly. A good speed reading course should therefore
    teach you to read at many different speeds, not just one speed
    that is faster than anything you can manage now. It should
    enable you to vary your rate of reading in accordance with the
    nature and complexity of the material.
    
    Our point is really very simple. Many books are hardly
    worth even skimming; some should be read quickly; and a few
    should be read at a rate, usually quite slow, that allows for
    complete comprehension. It is wasteful to read a book slowly
    that deserves only a fast reading; speed reading skills can
    help you solve that problem. But this is only one reading prob-
    lem. The obstacles that stand in the way of comprehension of
    a difficult book are not ordinarily, and perhaps never primarily,
    physiological or psychological. They arise because the reader
    simply does not know what to do when approaching a difficult
    —and rewarding—book. He does not know the rules of reading;
    he does not know how to marshal his intellectual resources
    for the task. No matter how quickly he reads, he will be no
    better off if, as is too often true, he does not know what he
    is looking for and does not know when he has found it.
    
    With regard to rates of reading, then, the ideal is not
    merely to be able to read faster, but to be able to read at dif-
    ferent speeds—and to know when the different speeds are ap-
    propriate. Inspectional reading is accomplished quickly, but
    that is not only because you read faster, although in fact you
    do; it is also because you read less of a book when you give it
    an inspectional reading, and because you read it in a different
    way, with different goals in mind. Analytical reading is ordi-
    narily much slower than inspectional reading, but even when
    you are giving a book an analytical reading, you should not
    read all of it at the same rate of speed. Every book, no matter
  - |-
    How difficult, contains interstitial material that can be and should be read quickly; and every good book also contains matter that is difficult and should be read very slowly.
    
    Fixations and Regressions
    
    Speed reading courses properly make much of the discovery—we have known it for half a century or more—that most people continue to sub-vocalize for years after they are first taught to read. Films of eye movements, furthermore, show that the eyes of young or untrained readers "fixate" as many as five or six times in the course of each line that is read. (The eye is blind while it moves; it can only see when it stops.) Thus single words or at the most two-word or three-word phrases are being read at a time, in jumps across the line. Even worse than that, the eyes of incompetent readers regress as often as once every two or three lines—that is, they return to phrases or sentences previously read.
    
    All of these habits are wasteful and obviously cut down reading speed. They are wasteful because the mind, unlike the eye, does not need to "read" only a word or short phrase at a time. The mind, that astounding instrument, can grasp a sentence or even a paragraph at a "glance"—if only the eyes will provide it with the information it needs. Thus the primary task—recognized as such by all speed reading courses—is to correct the fixations and regressions that slow so many readers down. Fortunately, this can be done quite easily. Once it is done, the student can read as fast as his mind will let him, not as slow as his eyes make him.
    
    There are various devices for breaking the eye fixations, some of them complicated and expensive. Usually, however, it is not necessary to employ any device more sophisticated than your own hand, which you can train yourself to follow as it moves more and more quickly across and down the page. You can do this yourself. Place your thumb and first two fingers

    together. Sweep this "pointer" across a line of type, a little
    faster than it is comfortable for your eyes to move. Force your-
    self to keep up with your hand. You will very soon be able to
    read the words as you follow your hand. Keep practicing this,
    and keep increasing the speed at which your hand moves, and
    before you know it you will have doubled or trebled your
    reading speed.
    
    The Problem of Comprehension
    
    But what exactly have you gained if you increase your
    reading speed significantly? It is true that you have saved time
    —but what about comprehension? Has that also increased, or
    has it suffered in the process?
    
    There is no speed reading course that we know of that
    does not claim to be able to increase your comprehension along
    with your reading speed. And on the whole, there is probably
    some foundation for these claims. The hand (or some other
    device ) used as a timer tends not only to increase your reading
    rate, but also to improve your concentration on what you are
    reading. As long as you are following your hand it is harder to
    fall asleep, to daydream, to let your mind wander. So far, so
    good. Concentration is another name for what we have called
    activity in reading. The good reader reads actively, with con-
    centration.
    
    But concentration alone does not really have much of an
    effect on comprehension, when that is properly understood.
    Comprehension involves much more than merely being able to
    answer simple questions of fact about a text. This limited kind
    of comprehension, in fact, is nothing but the elementary ability
    to answer the question about a book or other reading material:
    "What does it say?" The many further questions that, when
    correctly answered, imply higher levels of comprehension are
    seldom asked in speed reading courses, and instruction in how
    to answer them is seldom given.
    
    42 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    To make this clearer, let us take an example of something
    to read. Let us take the Declaration of Independence. You
    probably have a copy of it available. Take it down and look
    at it. It occupies less than three pages when printed. How fast
    should you read it?
  - |-
    The second paragraph of the Declaration ends with the sentence: "To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world." The following two pages of "facts," some of which, inci-dently, are quite dubious, can be read quickly. It is not necessary to gain more than a general idea of the kind of facts that Jefferson is citing, unless, of course, you are a scholar concerned with the historical circumstances in which he wrote. Even the last paragraph, ending with the justly celebrated statement that the signers "mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honour," can be read quickly. This is a rhetorical flourish, and it deserves what mere rhetoric always deserves. But the first two paragraphs of the Declaration of Independence require more than a first rapid reading.
    
    We doubt that there is anyone who can read those first two paragraphs at a rate much faster than 20 words a minute. In-deed, individual words in the famous second paragraph—
    
    39 «6 e >
    
    words like "inalienable," "rights," "liberty," "happiness," "con-sent," "just powers'—are worth dwelling over, puzzling about, considering at length. Properly read, for full comprehension, those first two paragraphs of the Declaration might require days, or weeks, or even years.
    
    The problem of speed reading, then, is the problem of comprehension. Practically, this comes down to defining com-prehension at levels beyond the elementary. Speed reading courses, for the most part, do not attempt this. It is worth emphasizing, therefore, that it is precisely comprehension in reading that this book seeks to improve. You cannot comprehend a book without reading it analytically; analytical reading, as we have noted, is undertaken primarily for the sake of com-prehension (or understanding ).
    
    The Second Level of Reading: Inspectional Reading 43
    
    Summary of Inspectional Reading
  - |-
    A few words in summary of this chapter. There is no  
    single right speed at which you should read; the ability to read  
    at various speeds and to know when each speed is appropriate  
    is the ideal. Great speed in reading is a dubious achievement;  
    it is of value only if what you have to read is not really worth  
    reading. A better formula is this: Every book should be read  
    no more slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you  
    can read it with satisfaction and comprehension. In any event,  
    the speed at which they read, be it fast or slow, is but a frac-  
    tional part of most people's problem with reading.
    
    Skimming or pre-reading a book is always a good idea; it  
    is necessary when you do not know, as is often the case,  
    whether the book you have in hand is worth reading carefully.  
    You will find that out by skimming it. It is generally desirable  
    to skim even a book that you intend to read carefully, to get  
    some idea of its form and structure.
    
    Finally, do not try to understand every word or page of a  
    difficult book the first time through. This is the most important  
    rule of all; it is the essence of inspectional reading. Do not be  
    afraid to be, or to seem to be, superficial. Race through even  
    the hardest book. You will then be prepared to read it well the  
    second time.
    
    We have now completed our initial discussion of the sec-  
    ond level of reading—inspectional reading. We will return to  
    the subject when we come to Part Four, where we will show  
    what an important role inspectional reading plays in syntopical  
    reading, the fourth and highest level of reading.
    
    However, you should keep in mind during our discussion  
    of the third level of reading—analytical reading—which is de-  
    scribed in the second part of this book, that inspectional read-  
    ing serves an important function at that level, too. The two  
    stages of inspectional reading can both be thought of as antici-  
    pations of steps that the reader takes when he reads analyti-

    cally. The first stage of inspectional reading—the stage we have
    called systematic skimming—serves to prepare the analytical
    reader to answer the questions that must be asked during the
    first stage of that level. Systematic skimming, in other words,
    anticipates the comprehension of a book's structure. And the
    second stage of inspectional reading—the stage we have called
    superficial reading—serves the reader when he comes to the
    second stage of reading at the analytical level. Superficial
    reading is the first necessary step in the interpretation of a
    book's contents.
    
    Before going on to explain analytical reading, we want
    to pause for a moment to consider again the nature of reading
    as an activity. There are certain actions the active or demand-
    ing reader must perform in order to read well. We will discuss
    them in the next chapter.

    HOW TO BE
    A DEMANDING READER
    
    The rules for reading yourself to sleep are easier to follow
    than are the rules for staying awake while reading. Get into
    bed in a comfortable position, make sure the light is inade-
    quate enough to cause a slight eyestrain, choose a book that is
    either terribly difficult or terribly boring—in any event, one
    that you do not really care whether you read or not—and you
    will be asleep in a few minutes. Those who are experts in
    relaxing with a book do not have to wait for nightfall. A com-
    fortable chair in the library will do any time.
    
    Unfortunately, the rules for keeping awake do not consist
    in doing just the opposite. It is possible to keep awake while
    reading in a comfortable chair or even in bed, and people have
    been known to strain their eyes by reading late in light too
    dim. What kept the famous candlelight readers awake? One
    thing certainly—it made a difference to them, a great differ-
    ence, whether or not they read the book they had in hand.
    
    Whether you manage to keep awake or not depends in
    large part on your goal in reading. If your aim in reading is to
    profit from it—to grow somehow in mind or spirit—you have to
    keep awake. That means reading as actively as possible. It
    means making an effort—an effort for which you expect to be
    repaid.
    
    Good books, fiction or nonfiction, deserve such reading.

    To use a good book as a sedative is conspicuous waste. To fall
    asleep or, what is the same, to let your mind wander during the
    hours you planned to devote to reading for profit—that is,
    primarily for understanding—is clearly to defeat your own ends.
    
    But the sad fact is that many people who can distinguish
    between profit and pleasure—between understanding, on the
    one hand, and entertainment or the mere satisfaction of curi-
    osity, on the other hand—nevertheless fail to carry out their
    reading plans. They fail even if they know which books give
    which. The reason is that they do not know how to be demand-
    ing readers, how to keep their mind on what they are doing by
    making it do the work without which no profit can be earned.
    
    The Essence of Active Reading:
    The Four Basic Questions a Reader Asks
    
    We have already discussed active reading extensively in
    this book. We have said that active reading is better reading,
    and we have noted that inspectional reading is always active.
    It is an effortful, not an effortless, undertaking. But we have
    not yet gone to the heart of the matter by stating the one
    simple prescription for active reading. It is: Ask questions
    while you read—questions that you yourself must try to answer
    in the course of reading.
    
    Any questions? No. The art of reading on any level above
    the elementary consists in the habit of asking the right ques-
    tions in the right order. There are four main questions you
    must ask about any book.*
    
    1. WHAT IS THE BOOK ABOUT AS A WHOLE? You must try
    to discover the leading theme of the book, and how the author
    
    * These four questions, as stated, together with the discussion of them
    that follows, apply mainly to expository or nonfiction works. However,
    the questions, when adapted, apply to fiction and poetry as well. The
    adaptations required are discussed in Chapters 14 and 15.
    How to Be a Demanding Reader 47
    
    develops this theme in an orderly way by subdividing it into
    its essential subordinate themes or topics.
    
    2. WHAT IS BEING SAID IN DETAIL, AND HOW? You must try
    to discover the main ideas, assertions, and arguments that
    constitute the author's particular message.
  - |-
    3. Is THE BOOK TRUE, IN WHOLE OR PART? You cannot answer this question until you have answered the first two. You have to know what is being said before you can decide whether it is true or not. When you understand a book, however, you are obligated, if you are reading seriously, to make up your own mind. Knowing the author's mind is not enough.
    
    4. What of 11? If the book has given you information, you must ask about its significance. Why does the author think it is important to know these things? Is it important to you to know them? And if the book has not only informed you, but also enlightened you, it is necessary to seek further enlightenment by asking what else follows, what is further implied or suggested.
    
    We will return to these four questions at length in the rest of this book. Stated another way, they become the basic rules of reading with which Part Two is mainly concerned. They are stated here in question form for a very good reason. Reading a book on any level beyond the elementary is essentially an effort on your part to ask it questions (and to answer them to the best of your ability). That should never be forgotten. And that is why there is all the difference in the world between the demanding and the undemanding reader. The latter asks no questions—and gets no answers.
    
    The four questions stated above summarize the whole obligation of a reader. They apply to anything worth reading—a book or an article or even an advertisement. Inspectional reading tends to provide more accurate answers to the first two questions than to the last two, but it nevertheless helps with those also. An analytical reading of a book has not been accomplished satisfactorily until you have answers to those last questions—until you have some idea of the book's truth, in whole or part, and of its significance, if only in your own scheme of things. The last question—What of it?—is probably the most important one in syntopical reading. Naturally, you will have to answer the first three questions before attempting the final one.
  - |-

    Knowing what the four questions are is not enough. You  
    must remember to ask them as you read. The habit of doing  
    that is the mark of a demanding reader. More than that, you  
    must know how to answer them precisely and accurately. The  
    trained ability to do that is the art of reading.
    
    People go to sleep over good books not because they are  
    unwilling to make the effort, but because they do not know  
    how to make it. Good books are over your head; they would  
    not be good for you if they were not. And books that are over  
    your head weary you unless you can reach up to them and pull  
    yourself up to their level. It is not the stretching that tires you,  
    but the frustration of stretching unsuccessfully because you  
    lack the skill to stretch effectively. To keep on reading actively,  
    you must have not only the will to do so, but also the skill—the  
    art that enables you to elevate yourself by mastering what at  
    first sight seems to be beyond you.
    
    How to Make a Book Your Own
    
    If you have the habit of asking a book questions as you  
    read, you are a better reader than if you do not. But, as we have  
    indicated, merely asking questions is not enough. You have to  
    try to answer them. And although that could be done, theoreti-  
    cally, in your mind only, it is much easier to do it with a pencil  
    in your hand. The pencil then becomes the sign of your alert-  
    ness while you read.
    
    It is an old saying that you have to "read between the  
    lines" to get the most out of anything. The rules of reading  
    are a formal way of saying this. But we want to persuade you  
    to "write between the lines," too. Unless you do, you are not  
    likely to do the most efficient kind of reading.
    
    When you buy a book, you establish a property right in it,  
    just as you do in clothes or furniture when you buy and pay  
    for them. But the act of purchase is actually only the prelude  
    to possession in the case of a book. Full ownership of a book  
    only comes when you have made it a part of yourself, and the  
    best way to make yourself a part of it--which comes to the  
    same thing--is by writing in it.
  - |-
    Why is marking a book indispensable to reading it? First,  
    it keeps you awake—not merely conscious, but wide awake.  
    Second, reading, if it is active, is thinking, and thinking tends  
    to express itself in words, spoken or written. The person who  
    says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does  
    not know what he thinks. Third, writing your reactions down  
    helps you to remember the thoughts of the author.
    
    Reading a book should be a conversation between you and  
    the author. Presumably he knows more about the subject than  
    you do; if not, you probably should not be bothering with his  
    book. But understanding is a two-way operation; the learner  
    has to question himself and question the teacher. He even has  
    to be willing to argue with the teacher, once he understands  
    what the teacher is saying. Marking a book is literally an ex-  
    pression of your differences or your agreements with the au-  
    thor. It is the highest respect you can pay him.
    
    There are all kinds of devices for marking a book intelli-  
    gently and fruitfully. Here are some devices that can be used:
    
    1. UNDERLINING—of major points; of important or forceful  
    statements.
    
    2. VERTICAL LINES AT THE MARGIN—to emphasize a state-  
    ment already underlined or to point to a passage too long to be  
    underlined.
    
    3. STAR, ASTERISK, OR OTHER DOODAD AT THE MARGIN—to  
    be used sparingly, to emphasize the ten or dozen most impor-  
    tant statements or passages in the book. You may want to fold  
    a corner of each page on which you make such marks or place  
    a slip of paper between the pages. In either case, you will be  
    able to take the book off the shelf at any time and, by opening  
    it to the indicated page, refresh your recollection.
    
    4. NUMBERS IN THE MARGIN—to indicate a sequence of  
    points made by the author in developing an argument.
  - |-
    5. NUMBERS OF OTHER PAGES IN THE MARGIN—to indicate where else in the book the author makes the same points, or points relevant to or in contradiction of those here marked; to tie up the ideas in a book, which, though they may be separated by many pages, belong together. Many readers use the symbol "Cf" to indicate the other page numbers; it means "compare" or "refer to."
    
    6. CIRCLING OF KEY WORDS OR PHRASES—This serves much the same function as underlining.
    
    7. WRITING IN THE MARGIN, OR AT THE TOP OR BOTTOM OF THE PAGE—to record questions (and perhaps answers) which a passage raises in your mind; to reduce a complicated discussion to a simple statement; to record the sequence of major points right through the book. The endpapers at the back of the book can be used to make a personal index of the author's points in the order of their appearance.
    
    To inveterate book-markers, the front endpapers are often the most important. Some people reserve them for a fancy bookplate. But that expresses only their financial ownership of the book. The front endpapers are better reserved for a record of your thinking. After finishing the book and making your personal index on the back endpapers, turn to the front and try to outline the book, not page by page or point by point (you have already done that at the back), but as an integrated structure, with a basic outline and an order of parts. That outline will be the measure of your understanding of the work; unlike a bookplate, it will express your intellectual ownership of the book.
    
    The Three Kinds of Note-making
    
    There are three quite different kinds of notes that you will make in your books as well as about them. Which kind you make depends upon the level at which you are reading.
  - |-
    When you give a book an inspectional reading, you may  
    not have much time to make notes in it; inspectional reading,  
    as we have observed, is always limited as to time. Nevertheless,  
    you are asking important questions about a book when you  
    read it at this level, and it would be desirable, even if it is not  
    always possible, to record your answers when they are fresh  
    in your mind.
    
    The questions answered by inspectional reading are: first,  
    what kind of book is it? second, what is it about as a whole?  
    and third, what is the structural order of the work whereby  
    the author develops his conception or understanding of that  
    general subject matter? You may and probably should make  
    notes concerning your answers to these questions, especially  
    if you know that it may be days or months before you will be  
    able to return to the book to give it an analytical reading. The  
    best place to make such notes is on the contents page, or per-  
    haps on the title page, which are otherwise unused in the  
    scheme we have outlined above.
    
    The point to recognize is that these notes primarily con-  
    cern the structure of the book, and not its substance—at least  
    not in detail. We therefore call this kind of note-making struc-  
    tural.
    
    In the course of an inspectional reading, especially of a  
    long and difficult book, you may attain some insights into the  
    author's ideas about his subject matter. Often, however, you  
    will not; and certainly you should put off making any judg-  
    ment of the accuracy or truth of the statements until you have  
    read the book more carefully. Then, during an analytical read-  
    ing, you will need to give answers to questions about the truth  
    and significance of the book. The notes you make at this level  
    of reading are, therefore, not structural but conceptual. They  
    concern the author's concepts, and also your own, as they have  
    been deepened or broadened by your reading of the book.
  - |-
    There is an obvious difference between structural and conceptual note-making. What kind of notes do you make when you are giving several books a syntopical reading—when you are reading more than one book on a single subject? Again, such notes will tend to be conceptual; and the notes on a page may refer you not only to other pages in that book, but also to pages in other books.
    
    There is a step beyond even that, however, and a truly expert reader can take it when he is reading several books syntopically. That is to make notes about the shape of the discussion—the discussion that is engaged in by all of the authors, even if unbeknownst to them. For reasons that will become clear in Part Four, we prefer to call such notes dialectical. Since they are made concerning several books, not just one, they often have to be made on a separate sheet (or sheets) of paper. Here, a structure of concepts is implied—an order of statements and questions about a single subject matter. We will return to this kind of note-making in Chapter 20.
    
    Forming the Habit of Reading
    
    Any art or skill is possessed by those who have formed the habit of operating according to its rules. This is the way the artist or craftsman in any field differs from those who lack his skill.
    
    Now there is no other way of forming a habit of operation than by operating. That is what it means to say one learns to do by doing. The difference between your activity before and after you have formed a habit is a difference in facility and readiness. After practice, you can do the same thing much better than when you started. That is what it means to say practice makes perfect. What you do very imperfectly at first, you gradually come to do with the kind of almost automatic perfection that an instinctive performance has. You do something as if you were born to it, as if the activity were as natural to you as walking or eating. That is what it means to say that habit is second nature.
  - |-
    Knowing the rules of an art is not the same as having the habit. When we speak of a man as skilled in any way, we do not mean that he knows the rules of making or doing something, but that he possesses the habit of making or doing it. Of course, it is true that knowing the rules, more or less explicitly, is a condition of getting the skill. You cannot follow rules you do not know. Nor can you acquire an artistic habit—any craft or skill—without following rules. The art as something that can be taught consists of rules to be followed in operation. The art as something learned and possessed consists of the habit that results from operating according to the rules.
    
    Incidentally, not everyone understands that being an artist consists in operating according to rules. People point to a highly original painter or sculptor and say, "He isn't following rules. He's doing something entirely original, something that has never been done before, something for which there are no rules." But they fail to see what rules it is that the artist follows. There are no final, unbreakable rules, strictly speaking, for making a painting or sculpture. But there are rules for preparing canvas and mixing paints and applying them, and for moulding clay or welding steel. Those rules the painter or sculptor must have followed, or else he could not have made the thing he has made. No matter how original his final production, no matter how little it seems to obey the "rules" of art as they have traditionally been understood, he must be skilled to produce it. And this is the art—the skill or craft—that we are talking about here.
    
    From Many Rules to One Habit
    
    Reading is like skiing. When done well, when done by an expert, both reading and skiing are graceful, harmonious activities. When done by a beginner, both are awkward, frustrating, and slow.
  - |-
    Learning to ski is one of the most humiliating experiences an adult can undergo (that is one reason to start young). After all, an adult has been walking for a long time; he knows where his feet are; he knows how to put one foot in front of the other in order to get somewhere. But as soon as he puts skis on his feet, it is as though he had to learn to walk all over again. He slips and slides, falls down, has trouble getting up, gets his skis crossed, tumbles again, and generally looks—and feels—like a fool.
    
    Even the best instructor seems at first to be no help. The ease with which the instructor performs actions that he says are simple but that the student secretly believes are impossible is almost insulting. How can you remember everything the instructor says you have to remember? Bend your knees. Look down the hill. Keep your weight on the downhill ski. Keep your back straight, but nevertheless lean forward. The admonitions seem endless—how can you think about all that and still ski?
    
    The point about skiing, of course, is that you should not be thinking about the separate acts that, together, make a smooth turn or series of linked turns—instead, you should merely be looking ahead of you down the hill, anticipating bumps and other skiers, enjoying the feel of the cold wind on your cheeks, smiling with pleasure at the fluid grace of your body as you speed down the mountain. In other words, you must learn to forget the separate acts in order to perform all of them, and indeed any of them, well. But in order to forget them as separate acts, you have to learn them first as separate acts. Only then can you put them together to become a good skier.

    It is the same with reading. Probably you have been
    reading for a long time, too, and starting to learn all over
    again can be humiliating. But it is just as true of reading as it
    is of skiing that you cannot coalesce a lot of different acts into
    one complex, harmonious performance until you become expert
    at each of them. You cannot telescope the different parts of
    the job so that they run into one another and fuse intimately.
    Each separate act requires your full attention while you are
    doing it. After you have practiced the parts separately, you can
    not only do each with greater facility and less attention but
    can also gradually put them together into a smoothly running
    whole.
    
    All of this is common knowledge about learning a complex
    skill. We say it here merely because we want you to realize
    that learning to read is at least as complex as learning to ski
    or to typewrite or to play tennis. If you can recall your patience
    in any other learning experience you have had, you will be
    more tolerant of instructors who will shortly enumerate a long
    list of rules for reading.
    
    The person who has had one experience in acquiring a
    complex skill knows that he need not fear the array of rules
    that present themselves at the beginning of something new to
    be learned. He knows that he does not have to worry about
    how all the separate acts in which he must become separately
    proficient are going to work together.
    
    The multiplicity of the rules indicates the complexity of
    the one habit to be formed, not a plurality of distinct habits.
    The parts coalesce and telescope as each reaches the stage of
    automatic execution. When all the subordinate acts can be
    done more or less automatically, you have formed the habit
    of the whole performance. Then you can think about tackling
    56 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    an expert run you have never skied before, or reading a book
    that you once thought was too difficult for you. At the be-
    ginning, the learner pays attention to himself and his skill in
    the separate acts. When the acts have lost their separateness in
    the skill of the whole performance, the learner can at last pay
    attention to the goal that the technique he has acquired enables
    him to reach.
  - |-
    We hope we have encouraged you by the things we have  
    said in these pages. It is hard to learn to read well. Not only  
    is reading, especially analytical reading, a very complex ac-  
    tivity—much more complex than skiing; it is also much more  
    of a mental activity. The beginning skier must think of physi-  
    cal acts that he can later forget and perform almost automati-  
    cally. It is relatively easy to think of and be conscious of  
    physical acts. It is much harder to think of mental acts, as the  
    beginning analytical reader must do; in a sense, he is thinking  
    about his own thoughts. Most of us are unaccustomed to doing  
    this. Nevertheless, it can be done, and a person who does it  
    cannot help learning to read much better.

    The Third Level  
    of Reading:  
    Analytical Reading

    PIGEONHOLING A BOOK
    
    We said at the beginning of this book that the instruction in  
    reading that it provides applies to anything you have to or  
    want to read. However, in expounding the rules of analytical  
    reading, as we will do in Part Two, we may seem to be ignor-  
    ing that fact. We will usually, if not always, refer to the read-  
    ing of whole books. Why is this so?
    
    The answer is simple. Reading a whole book, and espe-  
    cially a long and difficult one, poses the severest problems any  
    reader can face. Reading a short story is almost always easier  
    than reading a novel; reading an article is almost always  
    easier than reading a book on the same subject. If you can  
    read an epic poem or a novel, you can read a lyric or a short  
    story; if you can read an expository book—a history, a philo-  
    sophical work, a scientific treatise—you can read an article or  
    abstract in the same field.

    Hence everything that we will say about reading books
    applies to reading other materials of the kinds indicated. You
    are to understand, when we refer to the reading of books, that
    the rules expounded refer to lesser and more easily understood
    materials, too. Sometimes the rules do not apply to the latter
    in quite the same way, or to the extent that they apply to
    whole books. Nevertheless, it will always be easy for you to
    adapt them so that they are applicable.

    60 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    The Importance of Classifying Books
    
    The first rule of analytical reading can be expressed as
    follows: Rule 1. You MUST KNOW WHAT KIND OF BOOK YOU ARE
    READING, AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS AS EARLY IN THE PROCESS
    AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO READ.
    
    You must know, for instance, whether you are reading
    fiction—a novel, a play, an epic, a lyric—or whether it is an
    expository work of some sort. Almost every reader knows a
    work of fiction when he sees it. Or so it seems—and yet this is
    not always easy. Is Portnoy's Complaint a novel or a psycho-
    analytical study? Is Naked Lunch a fiction or a tract against
    drug abuse, similar to the books that used to recount the
    horrors of alcohol for the betterment of readers? Is Gone with
    the Wind a romance or a history of the South before and dur-
    ing the Civil War? Do Main Street and The Grapes of Wrath
    belong in the category of belles-lettres or are both of them
    sociological studies, the one concentrating on urban experi-
    ences, the other on agrarian life?
  - |-
    All of these, of course, are novels; all of them appeared on the fiction side of the best-seller lists. Yet the questions are not absurd. Just by their titles, it would be hard to tell in the case of Main Street and Middletown which was fiction and which was social science. There is so much social science in some contemporary novels, and so much fiction in much of sociology, that it is hard to keep them apart. But there is another kind of science, too—physics and chemistry, for instance—in books like The Andromeda Strain or the novels of Robert Heinlein or Arthur C. Clarke. And a book like The Universe and Dr. Ein-
    stein, while clearly not fiction, is almost as "readable" as a novel, and probably more readable than some of the novels of, say, William Faulkner.
    
    An expository book is one that conveys knowledge primarily, "knowledge" being construed broadly. Any book that consists primarily of opinions, theories, hypotheses, or specula-
    tions, for which the claim is made more or less explicitly that
    they are true in some sense, conveys knowledge in this meaning of knowledge and is an expository work. As with fiction, most people know an expository work when they see it. Here, however, the problem is not to distinguish nonfiction from fiction, but to recognize that there are various kinds of exposi-
    tory books. It is not merely a question of knowing which books are primarily instructive, but also which are instructive in a particular way. The kinds of information or enlightenment that a history and a philosophical work afford are not the same. The problems dealt with by a book on physics and one on morals are not the same, nor are the methods the writers
    employ in solving such different problems.
    
    Thus this first rule of analytical reading, though it is ap-
    plicable to all books, applies particularly to nonfictional, ex-
    pository works. How do you go about following the rule,
    particularly its last clause?
  - |-
    As we have already suggested, you do so by first inspect-
    ing the book—giving it an inspectional reading. You read the
    title, the subtitle, the table of contents, and you at least glance
    at the preface or introduction by the author and at the index.
    If the book has a dust jacket, you look at the publisher's blurb.
    These are the signal flags the author waves to let you know
    which way the wind is blowing. It is not his fault if you will
    not stop, look, and listen.
    
    What You Can Learn from the Title of a Book
    
    The numbers of readers who pay no attention to the sig-
    nals is larger than you might expect. We have had this experi-
    ence again and again with students. We have asked them what
    a book was about. We have asked them, in the most general
    terms, to tell us what sort of book it was. This is a good way,
    almost an indispensable way, to begin a discussion of a book.
    Nevertheless, it is often hard to get any kind of answer to the
    question.
    
    Let us take a couple of examples of the kind of confusion
    that can occur. In 1859, Darwin published a very famous book.
    A century later the entire English-speaking world celebrated
    the publication of the book. It was discussed endlessly, and its
    influence was assessed by learned and not-so-learned com-
    mentators. The book was about the theory of evolution, and
    the word "species" was in the title. What was the title?
  - |-
    Probably you said The Origin of Species, in which case  
    you were correct. But you might not have said that. You might  
    have said that the title was The Origin of the Species. Re-  
    cently, we asked some twenty-five reasonably well-read per-  
    sons what the title of Darwin's book was and more than half  
    said The Origin of the Species. The reason for the mistake is  
    obvious; they supposed, never having read the book, that it  
    had something to do with the development of the human  
    species. In fact, it has little or nothing to do with that subject,  
    which Darwin covered in a later book, The Descent of Man.  
    The Origin of Species is about what its title says it is about—  
    namely the proliferation in the natural world of a vast number  
    of species of plants and animals from an originally much  
    smaller number of species, owing mainly to the principle of  
    natural selection. We mention this common error because  
    many think they know the title of the book, although few have  
    actually ever read the title carefully and thought about what  
    it means.
    
    Here is another example. In this case we will not ask you  
    to remember the title, but to think about what it means.  
    Gibbon wrote a famous, and famously long, book about the  
    Roman Empire. He called it The Decline and Fall of the  
    Roman Empire. Almost everybody who takes up the book  
    recognizes that title; and most people, even without the book  
    in their hand, know the title. Indeed, the phrase "decline and  
    fall" has become proverbial. Nevertheless, when we asked the  
    same twenty-five well-read people why the first chapter is  
    called "The Extent and Military Force of the Empire in the  
    Age of the Antonines," they had no idea. They did not see that  
    if the book as a whole was titled Decline and Fall, then it  
    Pigeonholing a Book 63
  - |-
    might be assumed that the narrative would begin with the high
    point of the Roman Empire, and continue through to the end.
    Unconsciously, they had translated "decline and fall" into
    "rise and fall." They were puzzled because there was no dis-
    cussion of the Roman Republic, which ended a century and
    a half before the Age of the Antonines. If they had read the
    title carefully they could have assumed that the Age of the
    Antonines was the high point of the Empire, even if they had
    not known it before. Reading the title, in other words, could
    have given them essential information about the book before
    they started to read it; but they had failed to do that, as most
    people fail to do even with an unfamiliar book.
    
    One reason why titles and prefaces are ignored by many
    readers is that they do not think it important to classify the
    book they are reading. They do not follow this first rule of
    analytical reading. If they tried to follow it, they would be
    grateful to the author for helping them. Obviously, the author
    thinks it is important for the reader to know the kind of book
    he is being given. That is why he goes to the trouble of
    making it plain in the preface, and usually tries to make his
    title—or at least his subtitle—descriptive. Thus, Einstein and
    Infeld, in their preface to The Evolution of Physics, tell the
    reader that they expect him to know "that a scientific book,
    even though popular, must not be read in the same way as a
    novel." They also construct an analytical table of contents to
    advise the reader in advance of the details of their treatment.
    In any event, the chapter headings listed in the front serve the
    purpose of amplifying the significance of the main title.
    
    The reader who ignores all these things has only himself
    to blame if he is puzzled by the question, What kind of book
    is this? He is going to become more perplexed. If he cannot
    answer that question, and if he never asks it of himself, he is
    going to be unable to answer a lot of other questions about
    the book.
    
    Important as reading titles is, it is not enough. The clear-
    est titles in the world, the most explicit front matter, will not
  - |-
    Help you to classify a book unless you have the broad lines of classification already in your mind.
    
    You will not know the sense in which Euclid's Elements of Geometry and William James' Principles of Psychology are books of the same sort if you do not know that psychology and geometry are both sciences—and, incidentally, if you do not know that "elements" and "principles" mean much the same thing in these two titles (though not in general), nor will you further be able to distinguish them as different unless you know there are different kinds of science. Similarly, in the case of Aristotle's Politics and Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, you can tell how these books are alike and different only if you know what a practical problem is, and what different kinds of practical problems there are.
    
    Titles sometimes make the grouping of books easy. Anyone would know that Euclid's Elements, Descartes' Geometry, and Hilbert's Foundations of Geometry are three mathematical books, more or less closely related in subject matter. This is not always the case. It might not be so easy to tell from the titles that Augustine's The City of God, Hobbes' Leviathan, and Rousseau's Social Contract are political treatises, although a careful perusal of their chapter headings would reveal the problems that are common to these three books.
    
    Again, however, to group books as being of the same kind is not enough; to follow this first rule of reading you must know what that kind is. The title will not tell you, nor all the rest of the front matter, nor even the whole book itself sometimes, unless you have some categories you can apply to classify books intelligently. In other words, this rule has to be made a little more intelligible if you are to follow it intelligently. It can only be made intelligible by drawing distinctions and thus creating categories that make sense and will stand up to the test of time.
    
    We have already discussed a rough classification of books. The main distinction, we said, was between works of fiction, on the one hand, and works conveying knowledge, or expository
  - |-

    works, on the other other hand. Among expository works, we can
    further distinguish history from philosophy, and both from
    science and mathematics.
    
    Now this is all very well as far as it goes. This is a classi-
    fication scheme with fairly perspicuous categories, and most
    people could probably place most books in the right category
    if they thought about it. But not all books in all categories.
    
    The trouble is that as yet we have no principles of classi-
    fication. We will have more to say about these principles as we
    proceed in our discussion of the higher levels of reading. For
    the moment, we want to confine ourselves to one basic dis-
    tinction, a distinction that applies across the board to all ex-
    pository works. It is the distinction between theoretical and
    practical works.
    
    Practical vs. Theoretical Books
    
    Everyone uses the words "theoretical" and "practical,"
    but not everyone knows what they mean, perhaps least of
    all the hardheaded practical man who distrusts all theorists,
    especially if they are in the government. For such persons,
    "theoretical" means visionary or even mystical; "practical"
    means something that works, something that has an immediate
    cash return. There is an element of truth in this. The practical
    has to do with what works in some way, at once or in the long
    run. The theoretical concerns something to be seen or under-
    stood. If we polish the rough truth that is here being grasped,
    we come to the distinction between knowledge and action as
    the two ends a writer may have in mind.
    
    But, you may say, in dealing with expository books, are
    we not dealing with books that convey knowledge? How does
    action come into it? The answer, of course, is that intelligent
    action depends on knowledge. Knowledge can be used in many
    ways, not only for controlling nature and inventing useful
    machines or instruments but also for directing human conduct
    66 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    and regulating man's operations in various fields of skill. What
    we have in mind here is exemplified by the distinction between
    pure and applied science, or, as it is sometimes very inaccu-
    rately expressed, between science and technology.
  - |-
    Some books and some teachers are interested only in the knowledge itself that they have to communicate. This does not mean that they deny its utility, or that they insist that knowledge is good only for its own sake. They simply limit themselves to one kind of communication or teaching, and leave the other kind to other men. These others have an interest beyond knowledge for its own sake. They are concerned with the problems of human life that knowledge can help to solve. They communicate knowledge, too, but always with a view to and an emphasis upon its application.
    
    To make knowledge practical we must convert it into rules of operation. We must pass from knowing what is the case to knowing what to do about it if we wish to get somewhere. This can be summarized in the distinction between knowing that and knowing how. Theoretical books teach you that something is the case. Practical books teach you how to do something you want to do or think you should do.
    
    This book is practical, not theoretical. Any guidebook is a practical book. Any book that tells you either what you should do or how to do it is practical. Thus you see that the class of practical books includes all expositions of arts to be learned, all manuals of practice in any field, such as engineering or medicine or cooking, and all treatises that are conveniently classified as moral, such as books on economic, ethical, or political problems. We will later explain why this last group of books, properly called "normative," constitutes a very special category of practical books.
    
    Probably no one would question our calling expositions of arts to be learned and manuals or rule books, practical works. But the "practical" man to whom we have referred might object to the notion that a book on ethics, say, or one on economics, was practical. He might say that such a book was not practical because it was not true or would not work.
  - |-
    In fact, this is irrelevant to the point, although a book about economics that is not true is a bad book. Strictly speaking, any ethical work teaches us how to live our lives, tells us what we should do and not do, and often informs us of the rewards and punishments attached to doing and not doing it. Thus, whether or not we agree with its conclusions, any such work is practical. (Some modern sociological studies merely report the actual behavior of men, without judging it. These are neither ethical nor practical books. They are theoretical works—works of science. )
    
    Similarly with a work on economics. Apart from reportorial, mathematical, or statistical studies of economic behavior, which are theoretical rather than practical, such works usually teach us how to organize our economic life, either as individuals or as societies or states, tell us what we should do and not do, and also inform us of the penalties involved if we do not do what we should. Again, we may disagree, but our disagreement does not make the book unpractical.
    
    Immanuel Kant wrote two famous philosophical works, one called The Critique of Pure Reason, the other, The Critique of Practical Reason. The first is about what is and how we know it—not how to know it, but how we in fact do know it—as well as about what can and cannot be known. It is a theoretical book par excellence. The Critique of Practical Reason is about how men should conduct themselves and about what constitutes virtuous or right conduct. This book places great emphasis on duty as the basis of all right action, and that emphasis may seem repellent to many modern readers. They may even say it is "impractical" to believe that duty is any longer a useful ethical concept. What they mean, of course, is that Kant is wrong, in their opinion, in his basic approach. But that does not mean that his book is any less a practical work in the sense we are employing here.
    
    Apart from manuals and moral treatises (in the broad sense) one other instance of practical writing should be mentioned. An oration—a political speech or moral exhortation—certainly tries to tell you what you should do or how you
  - |-

    should feel about something. Anyone who writes practically
    about anything not only tries to advise you but also tries to
    persuade you to follow his advice. Hence there is an element
    of oratory or exhortation in every moral treatise. It is also
    present in books that try to teach an art, such as this one. Thus,
    in addition to trying to teach you to read better, we have tried,
    and will continue to try, to persuade you to make the effort to
    do so.
    
    Although every practical book is somewhat oratorical and
    hortatory, it does not follow that oratory and exhortation are
    coextensive with the practical. There is a difference between
    a political harangue and a treatise on politics, between eco-
    nomic propaganda and an analysis of economic problems.
    The Communist Manifesto is a piece of oratory, but Marx's
    Capital is much more than that.
    
    Sometimes you can detect that a book is practical by its
    title. If the title contains such phrases as "the art of" or "how
    to," you can spot it at once. If the title names fields that you
    know are practical, such as ethics or politics, engineering or
    business, and in many cases economics, law, or medicine, you
    can classify the book fairly readily.
    
    Titles can tell you even more than that. John Locke wrote
    two books with similar titles: An Essay Concerning Human
    Understanding and A Treatise Concerning the Origin, Extent,
    and End of Civil Government. Which of these is theoretical,
    which practical?
    
    From the titles alone we may conclude that the first is
    theoretical, because any analysis of understanding would be
    theoretical, and that the second is practical, because problems
    of government are themselves practical. But one could go
    beyond that, employing the techniques of inspectional reading
    that we have described. Locke wrote an introduction to the
    book on understanding. There he expressed his intention as
    being to inquire into the "origin, certainty, and extent of human
    knowledge." The phrasing resembles the title of the book on
    government, but with one important difference. Locke was

     concerned with the certainty or validity of knowledge in the
    one case, and with the end or purpose of government in the
    other. Questions about the validity of something are theoreti-
    cal, whereas to raise questions about the end of anything, the
    purpose it serves, is practical.
    
    In describing the art of inspectional reading, we noted
    that you should not ordinarily stop after reading the front
    matter of a book and perhaps its index. You should read pas-
    sages in the book that appear to be of a summary nature. You
    should also read the beginning and end of the book and of its
    major parts.
    
    This becomes necessary when, as is sometimes the case, it
    is impossible to classify a book from its title and other front
    matter. In that case, you have to depend on signs to be found
    in the main body of the text. By paying attention to the words
    and keeping the basic categories in mind, you should be able
    to classify a book without reading very far.
    
    A practical book will soon betray its character by the
    frequent occurrence of such words as "should" and "ought,"
    "good" and "bad," "ends" and "means." The characteristic
    statement in a practical book is one that says that something
    should be done (or made); or that this is the right way of
    doing (or making) something; or that one thing is better than
    another as an end to be sought, or a means to be chosen. In
    contrast, a theoretical book keeps saying "is," not "should"
    or "ought." It tries to show that something is true, that these
    are the facts; not that things would be better if they were
    otherwise, and here is the way to make them better.
    
    Before turning to theoretical books, let us caution you
    against supposing that the problem is as simple as telling
    whether you are drinking coffee or milk. We have merely sug-
    gested some signs whereby you can begin to make discrimina-
    tions. The better you understand everything that is involved
    in the distinction between the theoretical and the practical,
    the better you will be able to use the signs.
    
    For one thing, you will have to learn to mistrust them.
  - |-
    You have to be suspicious in classifying books. We have noted that although economics is primarily and usually a practical matter, there are nevertheless books on economics that are purely theoretical. Similarly, although understanding is primarily and usually a theoretical matter, there are books (most of them are terrible) that purport to teach you "how to think." You will also find authors who do not know the difference between theory and practice, just as there are novelists who do not know the difference between fiction and sociology. You will find books that are partly of one sort and partly of another, such as Spinoza's Ethics. It remains, nevertheless, to your advantage as a reader to detect the way an author approaches his problem.
    
    Kinds of Theoretical Books
    
    The traditional subdivision of theoretical books classifies them as history, science, and philosophy. Everybody knows the differences here in a rough way. It is only when you try to refine the obvious, and give the distinctions greater precision, that you get into difficulties. For the moment, let us try to skirt that danger and let rough approximations suffice.
    
    In the case of history, the title usually does the trick. If the word "history" does not appear in the title, the rest of the front matter is likely to inform us that this is a book about something that happened in the past—not necessarily in the far past, of course, because it may have happened only yesterday. The essence of history is narration. History is knowledge of particular events or things that not only existed in the past but also underwent a series of changes in the course of time. The historian narrates these happenings and often colors his narrative with comment on, or insight into, the significance of the events.
    
    History is chronotopic. Chronos is the Greek word for time, topos the Greek word for place. History always deals with things that existed or events that occurred on a particular date and in a particular place. The word "chronotopic" can remind you of that.

    Science is not concerned with the past as such. It treats
    of matters that can happen at any time or place. The scientist
    seeks laws or generalizations. He wants to find out how things
    happen for the most part or in every case, not, as the historian
    does, how some particular things happened at a given time
    and place in the past.
    
    The title of a scientific work is usually less revealing than
    the title of a history book. The word "science" sometimes
    appears, but more often the name of the subject matter appears,
    such as psychology or geology or physics. Then we must
    know whether that subject matter belongs to the scientist, as
    geology clearly does, or to the philosopher, as metaphysics
    clearly does. The trouble comes with the cases that are not so
    clear, such as physics and psychology, which have been
    claimed, at various times, by both scientists and philosophers.
    There is even trouble with the very words "philosophy" and
    "science," for they have been variously used. Aristotle called
    his book on Physics a scientific treatise, although according to
    current usage we should regard it as philosophical; and
    Newton titled his great work Mathematical Principles of
    Natural Philosophy, though for us it is one of the masterpieces
    of science.
    
    Philosophy is like science and unlike history in that it
    seeks general truths rather than an account of particular events,
    either in the near or distant past. But the philosopher does
    not ask the same questions as the scientist, nor does he em-
    ploy the same kind of method to answer them.
    
    Since titles and subject-matter names are not likely to help
    us determine whether a book is philosophical or scientific, how
    can we tell? There is one criterion that we think always works,
    although you may have to read a certain amount of the book
    before you can apply it. If a theoretical book emphasizes
    things that lie outside the scope of your normal, routine, daily
    experience, it is a scientific work. If not, it is philosophical.
    
    The distinction may be surprising. Let us illustrate it. ( Re-

    Member that it applies only to books that are either science or philosophy, not to books that are neither.) Galileo's Two New Sciences requires you to imagine, or to repeat for yourself in a laboratory, certain experiments with inclined planes. Newton's Opticks refers to experiences in dark rooms with prisms, mirrors, and specially controlled rays of light. The special experience to which the author refers may not have been obtained by him in a laboratory. The facts that Darwin reported in The Origin of Species he observed in the course of many years of work in the field. They are facts that can and have been rechecked by other observers making a similar effort. But they are not facts that can be checked in terms of the ordinary daily experience of the average man.
    
    In contrast, a philosophical book appeals to no facts or observations that lie outside the experience of the ordinary man. A philosopher refers the reader to his own normal and common experience for the verification or support of anything the writer has to say. Thus, Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding is a philosophical work in psychology, whereas many of Freud's writings are scientific. Locke makes every point in terms of the experience all of us have of our own mental processes. Freud can make many of his points only by reporting what he observed under the clinical conditions of the psychoanalyst's office.
    
    William James, another great psychologist, took an interesting middle course. He reports many examples of the special experience that only the careful, trained observer can know about, but he also frequently asks the reader to judge whether what is being said is not true from his own experience. Thus James' Principles of Psychology is both a scientific and a philosophical work, although it is primarily scientific.
    
    The distinction proposed here is popularly recognized when we say that science is experimental or depends upon elaborate observational researches, whereas philosophy is merely armchair thinking. The contrast should not be invidious. There are certain problems, some of them very important,
  - |-

    that can be solved in an armchair by a man who knows how
    to think about them in the light of common, human experience.
    There are other problems that no amount of the best armchair
    thinking can solve. What is needed to solve them is investiga-
    tion of some sort—experiments in the laboratory or research in
    the field—extending experience beyond the normal, everyday
    routine. Special experience is required.
    
    This does not mean that the philosopher is a pure thinker
    and the scientist merely an observer. Both have to observe and
    think, but they think about different sorts of observations. And
    however they may have arrived at the conclusions that they
    want to prove, they prove them in different ways, the scientist
    by pointing to the results of his special experiences, the phi-
    losopher by pointing to experiences that are common to all.
    
    This difference in method always reveals itself in philosophical and scientific books, and that is how you can tell
    which sort of book you are reading. If you note the sort of
    experience that is being referred to as a condition of under-
    standing what is being said, you will know whether the book
    is scientific or philosophical.
    
    It is important to know this because, apart from the dif-
    ferent kinds of experiences that they depend on, scientists and
    philosophers do not think in exactly the same way. Their styles
    in arguing are different. You must be able to find the terms
    and propositions—here we are getting a little ahead of our-
    selves—that constitute these different sorts of argumentation.
    
    The same is true of history. Historical statements are dif-
    ferent from scientific and philosophical ones. A historian
    argues differently and interprets facts differently. Furthermore,
    the typical history book is narrative in form. A narrative is a
    narrative, whether it be fact or fiction. The historian must
    write poetically, which means he must obey the rules for tell-
    ing a good story. Whatever other excellences Locke's Essay
    on Human Understanding or Newton's Principia may have,
    neither is a good story.
    
    You may object that we are making too much of the
    classification of books, at least before one has read them. Is it
    really all that important?
  - |-
    We may be able to meet the objections by calling your
    attention to one obvious fact. If you walked into a classroom
    in which a teacher was lecturing or otherwise instructing stu-
    dents, you could tell very soon whether the class was one in
    history, science, or philosophy. There would be something in
    the way the teacher proceeded, the kind of words he used, the
    type of arguments he employed, the sort of problems he pro-
    posed, and the kind of responses he expected from his students,
    that would give him away as belonging to one department or
    another. And it would make a difference to you to know this, if
    you were going to try to listen intelligently to what went on.
    
    In short, the methods of teaching different kinds of subject
    matter are different. Any teacher knows this. Because of the
    difference in method and subject matter, the philosopher usu-
    ally finds it easier to teach students who have not been previ-
    ously taught by his colleagues, whereas the scientist prefers
    the student whom his colleagues have already prepared. And
    so forth and so on.
    
    Now, just as there is a difference in the art of teaching in
    different fields, so there is a reciprocal difference in the art of
    being taught. The activity of the student must somehow be re-
    sponsive to the activity of the instructor. The relation between
    books and their readers is the same as that between teachers
    and their students. Hence, as books differ in the kinds of
    knowledge they have to communicate, they proceed to in-
    struct us differently; and, if we are to follow them, we must
    learn to read each kind in an appropriate manner.

    X-RAYING A BOOK
    
    Every book has a skeleton hidden between its covers. Your job
    as an analytical reader is to find it.
    
    A book comes to you with flesh on its bare bones and
    clothes over its flesh. It is all dressed up. You do not have to
    undress it or tear the flesh off its limbs to get at the firm struc-
    ture that underlies the soft surface. But you must read the
    book with X-ray eyes, for it is an essential part of your appre-
    hension of any book to grasp its structure.
  - |-
    Recognition of the need to see the structure of a book  
    leads to the discovery of the second and third rules for reading  
    any book. We say "any book." These rules apply to poetry as  
    well as to science, and to any kind of expository work. Their  
    application will be different, of course, according to the kind  
    of book they are used on. The unity of a novel is not the same  
    as the unity of a treatise on politics; nor are the parts of the  
    same sort, or ordered in the same way. But every book with-  
    out exception that is worth reading at all has a unity and an  
    organization of parts. A book that did not would be a mess. It  
    would be relatively unreadable, as bad books actually are.
    
    We will state these two rules as simply as possible. Then  
    we will explain and illustrate them.
    
    The second rule of analytical reading can be expressed as  
    follows: Rule 2. STATE THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE BOOK IN A  
    
    75  
    
    76 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    SINGLE SENTENCE, OR AT MOST A FEW SENTENCES (A SHORT PARA-  
    GRAPH).
    
    This means that you must say what the whole book is about  
    as briefly as possible. To say what the whole book is about is  
    not the same as saying what kind of book it is. (That was  
    covered by Rule 1.) The word "about" may be misleading  
    here. In one sense, a book is about a certain type of subject  
    matter, which it treats in a certain way. If you know this, you  
    know what kind of book it is. But there is another, more col-  
    loquial sense of "about." We ask a person what he is about,  
    what he is up to. So we can wonder what an author is up to,  
    what he is trying to do. To find out what a book is about in  
    this sense is to discover its theme or main point.
  - |-
    A book is a work of art. (Again, we want to warn you
    against too narrow a conception of "art." We do not mean, or
    we do not only mean, "fine art" here. A book is the product of
    someone who has a certain skill in making. He is a maker of
    books and he has made one here for our benefit.) In proportion
    as it is good, as a book and as a work of art, it has a more nearly
    perfect, a more pervasive unity. This is true of music and paint-
    ings, of novels and plays; it is no less true of books that convey
    knowledge.
    
    But it is not enough to acknowledge this fact vaguely. You
    must apprehend the unity with definiteness. There is only one
    way to know that you have succeeded. You must be able to
    tell yourself or anybody else what the unity is, and in a few
    words. (If it requires too many words, you have not seen the
    unity but a multiplicity.) Do not be satisfied with "feeling the
    unity" that you cannot express. The reader who says, "I know
    what it is, but I just can't say it," probably does not even fool
    himself.
    
    The third rule can be expressed as follows: Rule 3. Ser
    FORTH THE MAJOR PARTS OF THE BOOK, AND SHOW HOW THESE
    ARE ORGANIZED INTO A WHOLE, BY BEING ORDERED TO ONE AN-
    OTHER AND TO THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE.
    
    The reason for this rule should be obvious. If a work of
    art were absolutely simple, it would, of course, have no parts.
    But that is never the case. None of the sensible, physical things
    man knows is simple in this absolute way, nor is any human
    production. They are all complex unities. You have not grasped
    a complex unity if all you know about it is how it is one. You
    must also know how it is many, not a many that consists of a
    lot of separate things, but an organized many. If the parts
    were not organically related, the whole that they composed
    would not be one. Strictly speaking, there would be no whole
    at all but merely a collection.
  - |-
    There is a difference between a heap of bricks, on the one hand, and the single house they can constitute, on the other. There is a difference between a single house and a collection of houses. A book is like a single house. It is a mansion having many rooms, rooms on different levels, of different sizes and shapes, with different outlooks, with different uses. The rooms are independent, in part. Each has its own structure and interior decoration. But they are not absolutely independent and separate. They are connected by doors and arches, by corridors and stairways, by what architects call a "traffic pattern." Because they are connected, the partial function that each performs contributes its share to the usefulness of the whole house. Otherwise the house would not be livable.
    
    The analogy is almost perfect. A good book, like a good house, is an orderly arrangement of parts. Each major part has a certain amount of independence. As we will see, it may have an interior structure of its own, and it may be decorated in a different way from other parts. But it must also be connected with the other parts—that is, related to them functionally—for otherwise it would not contribute its share to the intelligibility of the whole.
    
    As houses are more or less livable, so books are more or less readable. The most readable book is an architectural achievement on the part of the author. The best books are those that have the most intelligible structure. Though they are usually more complex than poorer books, their greater complexity is also a greater simplicity, because their parts are better organized, more unified.
    
    That is one of the reasons why the best books are also the most readable. Lesser works are really more bothersome to read. Yet to read them well—that is, as well as they can be read—you must try to find some plan in them. They would have been better books if their authors had themselves seen the plan a little more clearly. But if they hang together at all, if they are a complex unity to any degree and not mere collections, there must be a plan and you must find it.
    
    Of Plots and Plans:
    Stating the Unity of a Book
  - |-
    Let us return now to the second rule, which requires you to state the unity of a book. A few illustrations of the rule in operation may guide you in putting it into practice.
    
    Let us begin with a famous case. You probably read Homer's Odyssey in school. If not, you must know the story of Odysseus, or Ulysses, as the Romans call him, the man who took ten years to return from the siege of Troy only to find his faithful wife Penelope herself besieged by suitors. It is an elaborate story as Homer tells it, full of exciting adventures on land and sea, replete with episodes of all sorts and many complications of plot. But it also has a single unity of action, a main thread of plot that ties everything together.
    
    Aristotle, in his Poetics, insists that this is the mark of every good story, novel, or play. To support his point, he shows how the unity of the Odyssey can be summarized in a few sentences.
    
    A certain man is absent from home for many years; he is jealously watched by Poseidon, and left desolate. Meanwhile his home is in a wretched plight; suitors are wasting his substance and plotting against his son. At length, tempest-tossed, he himself arrives; he makes certain persons acquainted with him; he attacks the suitors with his own hand, and is himself preserved while he destroys them.
    
    "This," says Aristotle, "is the essence of the plot; the rest is episode."
  - |-
    After you know the plot in this way, and through it the  
    unity of the whole narrative, you can put the parts into their  
    proper places. You might find it a good exercise to try this with  
    some novels you have read. Try it on some good ones, such as  
    Fielding's Tom Jones or Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment  
    or Joyce's modern Ulysses. The plot of Tom Jones, for instance,  
    can be reduced to the familiar formula: Boy meets girl, boy  
    loses girl, boy gets girl. That, indeed, is the plot of every ro-  
    mance. To recognize this is to learn what it means to say that  
    there are only a small number of plots in the world. The dif-  
    ference between good and bad stories having the same essen-  
    tial plot lies in what the author does with it, how he dresses up  
    the bare bones.
    
    You do not always have to find out the unity of a book  
    all by yourself. The author often helps you. Sometimes, the title  
    is all you have to read. In the eighteenth century, writers had  
    the habit of composing elaborate titles that told the reader  
    what the whole book was about. Here is a title by Jeremy  
    Collier, an English divine who attacked what he considered to  
    be the obscenity—we would say pornography, perhaps—of  
    Restoration drama much more learnedly than is customary  
    nowadays: A Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness  
    of the English Stage, together with the Sense of Antiquity upon  
    this Argument. You can guess from this that Collier recites  
    many flagrant instances of the abuse of morals and that he  
    supports his protest by quoting texts from those ancients who  
    argued, as Plato did, that the stage corrupts youth, or, as the  
    early Church fathers did, that plays are seductions of the  
    flesh and the devil.
    
    Sometimes the author tells you the unity of his plan in his
  - |-
    **Preface**
    
    In this respect, expository books differ radically from fiction. A scientific or philosophical writer has no reason to keep you in suspense. In fact, the less suspense he keeps you in, the more likely you are to sustain the effort of reading him through. Like a newspaper article, an expository book may summarize itself in its first paragraph.
    
    Do not be too proud to accept the author's help if he proffers it, but do not rely too completely on what he says in the preface, either. The best-laid plans of authors, like those of mice and other men, often go awry. Be guided by the prospectus the author gives you, but always remember that the obligation of finding the unity belongs finally to the reader, as much as the obligation of having one belongs to the writer. You can discharge that obligation honestly only by reading the whole book.
    
    The introductory paragraph of Herodotus' history of the war between the Greeks and the Persians provides an excellent summary of the whole. It runs:
    
    "These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, which he publishes, in the hope of thereby preserving from decay the remembrance of what men have done, and of preventing the great and wonderful actions of the Greeks and the Barbarians from losing their due meed of glory; and withal to put on record what were their grounds of feud."
    
    That is a good beginning for you as a reader. It tells you succinctly what the whole book is about.
    
    But you had better not stop there. After you have read the nine parts of Herodotus' history through, you will probably find it necessary to elaborate on that statement to do justice to the whole. You might want to mention the Persian kings—Cyrus, Darius, and Xerxes; the Greek heroes of the war—primarily Themistocles; and the major events—the crossing of the Hellespont and the decisive battles, notably Thermopylae and Salamis.
    
    All the rest of the fascinating details, with which Herodotus' history is filled, are left for you to discover as you read.

    tus richly prepares you for his climax, can be left out of your
    summary of the plot. Note, here, that the unity of a history is a
    single thread of plot, very much as in fiction. So far as unity
    is concerned, this rule of reading elicits the same kind of
    answer in history and in fiction.
    
    A few more illustrations may suffice. Let us take a prac-
    tical book first. The unity of Aristotle's Ethics can be stated
    thus:
    
    This is an inquiry into the nature of human happiness and an
    analysis of the conditions under which happiness may be gained
    or lost, with an indication of what men must do in their conduct
    and thinking in order to become happy or to avoid unhappiness, the
    principal emphasis being placed on the cultivation of the virtues,
    both moral and intellectual, although other goods are also recog-
    nized as necessary for happiness, such as wealth, health, friends,
    and a just society in which to live.
    
    Another practical book is Adam Smith's The Wealth of
    Nations. Here the reader is aided by the author's own state-
    ment of "the plan of the work" at the very beginning. But that
    takes several pages. The unity can be more briefly stated as
    follows:
    
    This is an inquiry into the source of national wealth in any
    economy that is built on a division of labor, considering the relation
    of the wages paid labor, the profits retumed to capital, and the
    rent owed the landowner, as the prime factors in the price of com-
    modities. It discusses the various ways in which capital can be more
    or less gainfully employed, and relates the origin and use of money
    to the accumulation and employment of capital. Examining the
    development of opulence in different nations and under different
    conditions, it compares the several systems of political economy,
    and argues for the beneficence of free trade.
    
    If a reader grasped the unity of The Wealth of Nations in this
    way, and did a similar job for Marx's Das Kapital, he would
    be well on the way toward seeing the relation between two
    of the most influential books of the past two centuries.
    82 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    Darwin's The Origin of Species provides us with a good
    example of the unity of a theoretical book in science. Here is a
    statement of it:
  - |-
    This is an account of the variation of living things during the course of countless generations and the way in which this results in new groupings of plants and animals; it treats both of the variability of domesticated animals and of variability under natural conditions, showing how such factors as the struggle for existence and natural selection operate to bring about and sustain such groupings; it argues that species are not fixed and immutable groups, but that they are merely varieties in transition from a less to a more marked and permanent status, supporting this argument by evidences from extinct animals found in the earth's crust, and from comparative embryology and anatomy.
    
    That may seem like a big mouthful, but the book was an even bigger one for a great many readers in the nineteenth century, partly because they did not go to the trouble of finding out what it was really about.
    
    Finally, let us take Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding as a theoretical book in philosophy. You may recall our observing that Locke himself summarized his work by saying that it was "an inquiry into the origin, certainty and extent of human knowledge, together with the grounds and degrees of belief, opinion and assent." We would not quarrel with so excellent a statement of plan by the author, except to add two subordinate qualifications to do justice to the first and third parts of the essay: it will be shown, we would add, that there are no innate ideas, but that all human knowledge is acquired from experience; and language will be discussed as a medium for the expression of thought, its proper use and most familiar abuses to be indicated.
    
    There are two things we want you to note before we proceed. The first is how frequently you can expect the author, especially a good one, to help you to state the plan of his book. Despite that fact, most readers are at a total loss if you ask them to say briefly what the whole book is about. Partly this is owing to the widespread inability to speak concise English sentences. Partly it is owing to neglect of this rule in reading. But it also indicates that many readers pay as little attention to the author's introductory words as they ordinarily do to his title.
  - |-
    The second point is a word of caution. Do not take the
    sample summaries we have given you as if they were, in each
    case, a final and absolute formulation of the book's unity. A
    unity can be variously stated. There is no one right way to do
    it. One statement is better than another, of course, in propor-
    tion as it is brief, accurate, and comprehensive. But quite dif-
    ferent statements may be equally good, or equally bad.
    
    We have here sometimes stated the unity of a book quite
    differently from the author's expression of it, and without
    apologies to him. You may differ similarly from us. After all,
    a book is something different to each reader. It would not be
    surprising if that difference expressed itself in the way the
    reader stated its unity. This does not mean, however, that any-
    thing goes. Though readers are different, the book is the same,
    and there can be an objective check upon the accuracy and
    fidelity of the statements anyone makes about it.
    
    Mastering the Multiplicity:
    The Art of Outlining a Book
    
    Let us turn now to the other structural rule, the rule that
    requires us to set forth the major parts of the book in their
    order and relation. This third rule is closely related to the
    second. A well-stated unity indicates the major parts that
    compose the whole; you cannot comprehend a whole without
    somehow seeing its parts. But it is also true that unless you
    grasp the organization of its parts, you cannot know the whole
    comprehensively.
    
    Why, then, make two rules here instead of one? It is pri-
    mary a matter of convenience. It is easier to grasp a complex
    and unified structure in two steps than in one. The second rule
    directs your attention toward the unity, the third toward the
    complexity, of a book. There is another reason for the separa-
    tion. The major parts of a book may be seen at the moment
    when you grasp its unity. But these parts are themselves usu-
    ally complex and have an interior structure you must see.
    Hence the third rule involves more than just an enumeration
    of the parts. It means outlining them, that is, treating the parts
    as if they were subordinate wholes, each with a unity and
    complexity of its own.
  - |-
    A formula can be stated for operating according to this third rule. It will guide you in a general way. According to the second rule, we had to say: The whole book is about so and so and such and such. That done, we might obey the third rule by proceeding as follows: (1) The author accomplished this plan in five major parts, of which the first part is about so and so, the second part is about such and such, the third part is about this, the fourth part about that, and the fifth part about still another thing. (2) The first of these major parts is divided into three sections, of which the first considers X, the second considers Y, and the third considers Z. (3) In the first section of the first part, the author makes four points, of which the first is A, the second B, the third C, and the fourth D. And so on and so forth.
    
    You may object to this much outlining. It would take a lifetime to read a book that way. But of course this is only a formula. The rule looks as if it required an impossible amount of work from you. In fact, the good reader does this sort of thing habitually, and hence easily and naturally. He may not write it all out. He may not even at the time of reading have made it all verbally explicit. But if he were called upon to give an account of the structure of the book, he would do something that approximated the formula we have described.
    
    The word "approximation" should relieve your anxiety. A good rule always describes the ideal performance. But a person can be skilled in an art without being the ideal artist. He can be a good practitioner if he merely approximates the rule. We have stated the rule here for the ideal case. You should be satisfied if you make a very rough approximation to what is required.
  - |-
    Even when you become more skilled, you will not want  
    to read every book with the same degree of effort. You will  
    not find it profitable to expend all your skill on some books.  
    Even the best readers try to make a fairly close approximation  
    to the requirements of this rule for only a relatively few books.  
    For the most part, they are satisfied with a rough notion of the  
    book's structure. The degree of approximation varies with the  
    character of the book and your purpose in reading it. Regard-  
    less of this variability, the rule remains the same. You must  
    know how to follow it, whether you follow it closely or only in  
    a rough fashion.
    
    You should understand that the limitations on the degree  
    to which you can approximate the rule are not only ones of  
    time and effort. You are a finite, mortal creature; but a book is  
    also finite and, if not mortal, at least defective in the way all  
    things made by man are. No book deserves a perfect outline  
    because no book is perfect. It goes only so far, and so must  
    you. This rule, after all, does not call for your putting things  
    into the book that the author did not put there. Your outline  
    is of the book itself, not the subject matter that the book is  
    about. Perhaps the outline of a subject matter could be ex-  
    tended indefinitely, but not your outline of the book, which  
    gives the subject matter only more or less definitive treatment.  
    Hence you should not feel that we are urging you merely to be  
    lazy about following this rule. You could not follow it out to  
    the bitter end even if you wanted to.
    
    The forbidding aspect of the formula for setting forth the  
    order and relation of the parts may be somewhat lessened by a  
    few illustrations of the rule in operation. Unfortunately, it is  
    more difficult to illustrate this rule than the other one about  
    stating the unity. A unity, after all, can be stated in a sentence  
    or two, at most a short paragraph. But in the case of a large  
    and complex book, a careful and adequate outline of the parts,  
    and their parts, and their parts down to the least structural unit  
    that is comprehensible and worthwhile identifying, would take  
    a great many pages to write out.

    Theoretically, the outline could be longer than the origi-
    nal. Some of the great medieval commentaries on the works of
    Aristotle are longer than the works they comment on. They
    include, of course, more than an outline, for they undertake to
    interpret the author sentence by sentence. The same is true of
    certain modern commentaries, such as the great ones on Kant's
    Critique of Pure Reason. And a variorum edition of a Shake-
    speare play, which includes an exhaustive outline as well as
    other things, is many times as long—perhaps ten times as long
    —as the original. You might look into a commentary of this sort
    if ypu want to see the rule followed as close to perfection as
    man can do. Aquinas, for instance, begins each section of his
    commentary with a beautiful outline of the points that Aristotle
    has made in a particular part of his work; and he always says
    explicitly how that part fits the structure of the whole, espe-
    cially in relation to the parts that come before and after.
    
    Let us take something easier than a treatise of Aristotle.
    Aristotle is probably the most compact of prose writers; you
    would expect that an outline of one of his works would be ex-
    tensive and difficult. Let us also agree that, for the sake of the
    example, we will not carry the process out to the relative per-
    fection that would be possible if we had a great number of
    pages available.
    
    The United States Constitution is an interesting, practical
    document, and a very well-organized piece of writing. If you
    examine it, you should have no difficulty in finding its major
    parts. They are pretty clearly indicated, though you have to do
    some thinking to make the main divisions. Here is a suggested
    outline of the document:
    
    First: The Preamble, setting forth the purpose(s) of the Con-
    stitution;
    SEconp: The first Article, dealing with the legislative depart-
    ment of the government;
    
    THIRD: The second Article, dealing with the executive depart-
    ment of the government;
    
    FourTH: The third Article, dealing with the judicial depart-
    ment of the government;
    
    Firtu: The fourth Article, dealing with the relationship be-
    tween the state governments and the federal government;
  - |-
    S1xTu: The fifth, sixth, and seventh Articles, dealing with the amendment of the Constitution, its status as the supreme law of the land, and provisions for its ratifications;
    
    SEVENTH: The first ten amendments, constituting the Bill of Rights;
    
    EIGHTH: The remaining amendments up to the present day.
    
    Those are the major divisions. Now let us outline one of them, the Second, comprising the Constitution's first Article. Like most of the other Articles, it is divided into Sections. Here is a suggested outline.
    
    II, 1: Section 1, establishing legislative powers in a Congress of the United States, divided into two bodies, a Senate and a House of Representatives;
    
    II, 2: Sections 2 and 3, respectively describing the composition of the House and Senate and stating the qualifications of members. In addition, it is stated that the House has the sole power of impeachment, while the Senate has the sole power of trying impeachments;
    
    II, 3: Sections 4 and 5, having to do with the election of members of both branches of Congress and with the internal organization and affairs of each;
    
    II, 4: Section 6, stating the perquisites and emoluments of members of both branches, and stating one limitation on civil employment of members;
    
    II, 5: Section 7, defining the relationship between the legislative and executive departments of the government and describing the President's veto power;
    
    II, 6: Section 8, stating the powers of Congress;
    
    II, 7: Section 9, stating some limitations on the powers outlined in Section 8;
    
    II, 8: Section 10, stating limitations on the powers of the states and the extent to which they must give over certain powers to the Congress.
    
    We could then proceed to make a similar outline of all the other major divisions, and, after completing that, return to outline the Sections in turn. Some of these, for example Section 8 in Article I, would require the identification of many different topics and subtopics.
  - |-
    Of course, this is only one way of doing the job. There are  
    many others. The first three Articles could be grouped together  
    in one major division, for instance; or instead of two divisions  
    with respect to the amendments, more major divisions could be  
    introduced, grouping the amendments according to the prob-  
    lems they dealt with. We suggest that. you try your hand at  
    making your own division of the Constitution into its main  
    parts. Go even further than we did, and try to state the parts  
    of the parts as well. You may have read the Constitution many  
    times, but if you have not applied this rule before, you will  
    find that it reveals much in the document that you never saw.  
    
    Here is one more example, again very brief. We have al-  
    ready stated the unity of Aristotle's Ethics. Now let us attempt  
    a first approximation of its structure. The whole is divided into  
    the following main parts: A first, treating of happiness as the  
    end of life, and discussing it in relation to all other practicable  
    goods; a second, treating of the nature of voluntary action, and  
    its relation to the formation of good and bad habits; a third,  
    discussing the various virtues and vices, both moral and intel-  
    lectual; a fourth, dealing with moral states that are neither  
    virtuous nor vicious; a fifth, treating of friendship; and a sixth  
    and last, discussing pleasure, and completing the account of  
    human happiness begun in the first.  
    
    These divisions obviously do not correspond to the ten  
    X-Raying a Book 89  
    
    books of the Ethics. Thus, the first part is accomplished in the  
    first book; the second part runs through Book II and the  
    first half of Book III; the third part extends from the rest of  
    Book III through the end of Book VI; the discussion of pleas-  
    ure occurs at the end of Book VII and again at the beginning  
    of Book X.
  - |-
    We mention this to show you that you need not follow the
    apparent structure of a book as indicated by its chapter divi-
    sions. That structure may, of course, be better than the outline
    you develop, but it may also be worse; in any event, the point
    is to make your own outline. The author made his in order to
    write a good book. You must make yours in order to read it
    well. If he were a perfect writer and you a perfect reader, it
    would follow that the two would be the same. In proportion
    as either of you falls away from perfection, all sorts of dis-
    crepancies will inevitably result.
    
    This does not mean that you should ignore chapter head-
    ings and sectional divisions made by the author; we did not
    ignore them in our analysis of the Constitution, although we did
    not slavishly follow them, either. They are intended to help you,
    just as titles and prefaces are. But you must use them as guides
    for your own activity, and not rely on them passively. There
    are few authors who execute their plan perfectly, but there is
    often more plan in a good book than meets the eye at first.
    The surface can be deceiving. You must look beneath it to
    discover the real structure.
    
    How important is it to discover that real structure? We
    think very important. Another way of saying this is to say that
    Rule 2—the requirement that you state the unity of a book—
    cannot be effectively followed without obeying Rule 3—the
    requirement that you state the parts that make up that unity.
    You might, from a cursory glance at a book, be able to come
    up with an adequate statement of its unity in two or three
    sentences. But you would not really know that it was adequate.
    Someone else, who had read the book better, might know this,
    and award you high marks for your efforts. But for you, from
    your point of view, it would have been merely a good guess, a
    lucky hit. This is why the third rule is absolutely necessary as
    a complement to the second one.
  - |-
    A very simple example will show what we mean. A two-year-old child, just having begun to talk, might say that "two plus two is four." Objectively, this is a true statement; but we would be wrong to conclude from it that the child knew much mathematics. In fact, the child probably would not know what the statement meant, and so, although the statement by itself was adequate, we would have to say that the child still needed training in the subject. Similarly, you might be right in your guess about a book's main theme or point, but you still need to go through the exercise of showing how and why you stated it as you did. The requirement that you outline the parts of a book, and show how they exemplify and develop the main theme, is thus supportive of your statement of the book's unity.
    
    The Reciprocal Arts of Reading and Writing
    
    In general, the two rules of reading that we have been discussing look as if they were rules of writing also. Of course they are. Writing and reading are reciprocal, as are teaching and being taught. If authors and teachers did not organize their communications, if they failed to unify them and order their parts, there would be no point in directing readers or listeners to search for the unity and uncover the structure of the whole.
    
    Nevertheless, although the rules are reciprocal, they are not followed in the same way. The reader tries to uncover the skeleton that the book conceals. The author starts with the skeleton and tries to cover it up. His aim is to conceal the skeleton artistically or, in other words, to put flesh on the bare bones. If he is a good writer, he does not bury a puny skeleton under a mass of fat; on the other hand, neither should the flesh be too thin, so that the bones show through. If the flesh is thick enough, and if flabbiness is avoided, the joints will be detectable and the motion of the parts will reveal the articulation.
  - |-
    Why is this so? Why should not an expository book, one  
    that attempts to present a body of knowledge in an ordered  
    way, be merely an outline of the subject? The reason is not  
    only that most readers cannot read outlines, and that such  
    a book would be repellent to a self-respecting reader who  
    thought that if he could do his job, the author ought to do his.  
    There is more to it than that. The flesh of a book is as much  
    a part of it as the skeleton. This is as true of books as it is of  
    animals and human beings. The flesh—the outline spelled out,  
    "read out," as we sometimes say—adds an essential dimension.  
    It adds life, in the case of the animal. Just so, actually writing  
    the book from an outline, no matter how detailed, gives the  
    work a kind of life that it would not otherwise have had.
    
    We can summarize all of this by recalling the old-fashioned  
    maxim that a piece of writing should have unity, clarity, and  
    coherence. That is, indeed, a basic maxim of good writing. The  
    two rules we have been discussing in this chapter relate to  
    writing that follows that maxim. If the writing has unity, we  
    must find it. If the writing has clarity and coherence, we must  
    appreciate it by finding the distinction and the order of the  
    parts. What is clear is so by the distinctness of its outlines.  
    What is coherent hangs together in an orderly disposition of  
    parts.
    
    These two rules, therefore, can be used to distinguish well  
    made books from badly made ones. If, after you have attained  
    sufficient skill, no amount of effort on your part results in your  
    apprehension of the unity of a book, and if you are also not  
    able to discern its parts and their relation to one another, then  
    very likely the book is a bad one, whatever its reputation. You  
    should not be too quick to make this judgment; perhaps the  
    fault is in you instead of the book. However, neither should  
    you fail ever to make it and always assume that the fault is in  
    you. In fact, whatever your own failings as a reader, the fault  
    is usually in the book, for most books—the very great majority
  - |-
    —are badly made books in the sense that their authors did not write them according to these rules.
    
    These two rules can also, we might add, be used in reading any substantial part of an expository book, as well as the whole. If the part chosen is itself a relatively independent, complex unity, its unity and complexity must be discerned for it to be well read. Here there is a significant difference between books conveying knowledge and poetical works, plays, and novels. The parts of the former can be much more autonomous than the parts of the latter. The person who says of a novel that he has "read enough to get the idea" does not know what he is talking about. He cannot be correct, for if the novel is any good at all, the idea is in the whole and cannot be found short of reading the whole. But you can get the idea of Aristotle's Ethics or Darwin's Origin of Species by reading some parts carefully, although you would not, in that case, be able to observe Rule 3.
    
    Discovering the Author's Intentions
    
    There is one more rule of reading that we want to discuss in this chapter. It can be stated briefly. It needs little explanation and no illustration. It really repeats in another form what you have already done if you have applied the second and third rules. But it is a useful repetition because it throws the whole and its parts into another light.
    
    This fourth rule can be stated thus: Rule 4. Find out WHAT THE AUTHOR'S PROBLEMS WERE. The author of a book starts with a question or a set of questions. The book ostensibly contains the answer or answers.
    
    The writer may or may not tell you what the questions were as well as give you the answers that are the fruits of his work. Whether he does or does not, and especially if he does not, it is your task as a reader to formulate the questions as precisely as you can. You should be able to state the main
  - |-

    The question that the book tries to answer, and you should be able  
    to state the subordinate questions if the main question is com-  
    plex and has many parts. You should not only have a fairly ade-  
    quate grasp of all the questions involved but should also be able to put the questions in an intelligible order. Which are  
    primary and which secondary? Which questions must be an-  
    swered first, if others are to be answered later?
    
    You can see how this rule duplicates, in a sense, work you  
    have already done in stating the unity and finding its parts. It  
    may, however, actually help you to do that work. In other  
    words, following the fourth rule is a useful procedure in con-  
    junction with obeying the other two.
    
    And since the rule is a little more unfamiliar than the other  
    two, it may be even more helpful to you in tackling a difficult  
    book. We want to emphasize, however, that we do not mean  
    for you to fall into what is called by critics the intentional fal-  
    acy. That is the fallacy of thinking you can discover what was  
    in an author's mind from the book he has written. This applies  
    particularly to literary works; it is a grave error, for example, to  
    try to psychoanalyze Shakespeare from the evidence of Hamlet.  
    Nevertheless, even with a poetical work, it is often extremely  
    helpful to try to say what the author was trying to do. In the  
    case of expository works, the rule has obvious merit. And yet  
    most readers, no matter how skilled in other respects, very  
    often fail to observe it. As a result, their conception of a book's  
    main point or theme may be extremely deficient, and of course  
    their outline, of its structure will be chaotic. They will fail to  
    see the unity of a book because they do not see why it has the  
    unity it has; and their apprehension of the book's skeletal  
    structure will lack comprehension of the end that it serves.
  - |-
    If you know the kinds of questions anyone can ask about anything, you will become adept in detecting an author's problems. They can be formulated briefly: Does something exist? What kind of thing is it? What caused it to exist, or under what conditions can it exist, or why does it exist? What purpose does it serve? What are the consequences of its existence? What are its characteristic properties, its typical traits? What are its relations to other things of a similar sort, or of a different sort? How does it behave? These are all theoretical questions. What ends should be sought? What means should be chosen to a given end? What things must one do to gain a certain objective, and in what order? Under these conditions, what is the right thing to do, or the better rather than the worse? Under what conditions would it be better to do this rather than that? These are all practical questions.
    
    This list of questions is far from being exhaustive, but it does represent the types of most frequently asked questions in the pursuit of theoretical or practical knowledge. It may help you discover the problems a book has tried to solve. The questions have to be adapted when applied to works of imaginative literature, and there too they will be useful.
    
    The First Stage of Analytical Reading
    
    We have now stated and explained the first four rules of reading. They are rules of analytical reading, although if you inspect a book well before reading it, that will help you to apply them.
    
    It is important at this point to recognize that these first four rules are connected and form a group of rules having a single aim. Together, they provide the reader who applies them with a knowledge of a book's structure. When you have applied them to a book, or indeed to anything fairly lengthy and difficult that you may be reading, you will have accomplished the first stage of reading it analytically.
  - |-

     You should not take the term "stage" in a chronological
    sense, unless perhaps at the very beginning of your exercise
    as an analytical reader. That is, it is not necessary to read a
    book through in order to apply the first four rules, then to
    read it again and again in order to apply the other rules. The
    practiced reader accomplishes all of these stages at once. Never-
    
    X-Raying a Book 95
    
    theless, you must realize that knowing a book's structure does
    constitute a stage toward reading it analytically.
    
    Another way to say this is that applying these first four rules
    helps you to answer the first basic question about a book. You
    will recall that that first question is: What is the book about as
    a whole? You will also recall that we said that this means dis-
    covering the leading theme of the book, and how the author
    develops this theme in an orderly way by subdividing it into
    its essential subordinate themes or topics. Clearly, applying
    the first four rules of reading will provide most of what you
    need to know in order to answer this question—although it
    should be pointed out that your answer will improve in ac-
    curacy as you proceed to apply the other rules and to answer
    the other questions,
    
    Since we have now described the first stage of analytical
    reading, let us pause a moment to write out the first four rules
    in order, under the appropriate heading, for review.
    
    The First Stage of Analytical Reading,
    or Rules for Finding What a Book Is About
    
    1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.
    
    2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.
    
    3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and
    outline these parts as you have outlined the whole.
    
    4. Define the problem or problems the author is trying to
    
    solve.

    COMING TO TERMS
    WITH AN AUTHOR
    
    The first stage of analytical reading has been accomplished
    when you have applied the four rules listed at the end of the
    last chapter, which together allow you to tell what a book is
    about and to outline its structure. You are now ready to go on
    to the next stage, which also comprises four rules of reading.
    The first of these we call, for short, coming to terms.
  - |-
    Coming to terms is usually the last step in any successful  
    business negotiation. All that remains is to sign on the dotted  
    line. But in the analytical reading of a book, coming to terms  
    is the first step beyond the outline. Unless the reader comes to  
    terms with the author, the communication of knowledge from  
    one to the other does not take place. For a term is the basic  
    element of communicable knowledge.
    
    Words vs. Terms
    
    A term is not a word—at least, not just a word without  
    further qualifications. If a term and a word were exactly the  
    same, you would only have to find the important words in a  
    book in order to come to terms with it. But a word can have  
    many meanings, especially an important word. If the author  
    uses a word in one meaning, and the reader reads it in another,
    
    96  
    Coming to Terms With an Author 97
    
    words have passed between them, but they have not come to  
    terms. Where there is unresolved ambiguity in communication,  
    there is no communication, or at best communication must be  
    incomplete.
    
    Just look at the word "communication" for a moment. Its  
    root is related to the word "common." We speak of a com-  
    munity as a group of people who have something in common.  
    Communication is an effort on the part of one person to share  
    something with another person (or with an animal or a ma-  
    chine): his knowledge, his decisions, his sentiments. It suc-  
    ceeds only when it results in a common something, such as an  
    item of information or knowledge that two parties share.
    
    When there is ambiguity in the communication of knowl-  
    edge, all that is in common are the words that one person  
    speaks or writes and another hears or reads. So long as am-  
    biguity persists, there is no meaning in common between  
    writer and reader. For the communication to be successfully  
    completed, therefore, it is necessary for the two parties to use  
    the same words with the same meanings—in short, to come to  
    terms. When that happens, communication happens, the mira-  
    cle of two minds with but a single thought.
  - |-
    A term can be defined as an unambiguous word. That is  
    not quite accurate, for strictly there are no unambiguous words.  
    What we should have said is that a term is a word used unam-  
    biguously. The dictionary is full of words. They are almost all  
    ambiguous in the sense that they have many meanings. But a  
    word that has several meanings can be used in one sense at a  
    time. When writer and reader somehow manage for a time to  
    use a given word with one and only one meaning, then, during  
    that time of unambiguous usage, they have come to terms.
    
    You cannot find terms in dictionaries, though the materials  
    for making them are there. Terms occur only in the process of  
    communication. They occur when a writer tries to avoid am-  
    biguity and a reader helps him by trying to follow his use of  
    words. There are, of course, many degrees of success in this.  
    Coming to terms is the ideal toward which writer and reader  
    should strive. Since this is one of the primary achievements of  
    the art of writing and reading, we can think of terms as a  
    skilled use of words for the sake of communicating knowledge.
    
    At this point it is probably clear that we are speaking  
    exclusively of expository writers and expository books. Poetry  
    and fiction are not nearly so concerned with the unambiguous  
    use of words as expository works—works that convey know-  
    ledge in the broad sense of the word that we have been employ-  
    ing. It can even be argued that the best poetry is that which  
    is the most richly ambiguous, and it has been said with  
    justice that any good poet is sometimes intentionally ambigu-  
    ous in his writing. This is an important insight about poetry to  
    which we will return later. It is obviously one of the primary  
    differences between the poetical and the expository or sci-  
    entific realms of literary art.
  - |-
    We are now ready to state the fifth rule of reading (an expository work). Stated roughly, it is this: You must spot the important words in a book and figure out how the author is using them. But we can make that a little more precise and elegant: Rule 5, FIND THE IMPORTANT WORDS AND THROUGH THEM COME TO TERMS WITH THE AUTHOR. Note that the rule has two parts. The first part is to locate the important words, the words that make a difference. The second part is to determine the meaning of these words, as used, with precision.
    
    This is the first rule for the second stage of analytical reading, the aim of which is not the outlining of a book's structure but the interpretation of its contents or message. The other rules for this stage, to be discussed in the next chapter, are like this one in an important respect. They also require you to take two steps: a step dealing with the language as such, and a step beyond the language to the thought that lies behind it.
    
    If language were a pure and perfect medium for thought, these steps would not be separate. If every word had only one meaning, if words could not be used ambiguously, if, in short, each word was an ideal term, language would be a diaphanous medium. The reader would see straight through the writer's words to the content of his mind. If that were the case, there would be no need at all for this second stage of analytical reading. Interpretation would be unnecessary.
    
    But of course that is far from the case. There is no use crying about it, no use making up impossible schemes for an ideal language, as the philosopher Leibniz and some of his followers have tried to do. Indeed, if they succeeded, there would be no more poetry. The only thing to do, therefore, in expository works, is to make the best of language as it is, and the only way to do that is to use language as skillfully as possible when you want to convey, or to receive, knowledge.
  - |-
    Because language is imperfect as a medium for conveying  
    knowledge, it also functions as an obstacle to communication.  
    The rules of interpretive reading are directed to overcoming  
    that obstacle. We can expect a good writer to do his best to  
    reach us through the barrier language inevitably sets up, but  
    we cannot expect him to do the job all by himself. We must  
    meet him halfway. We, as readers, must try to tunnel through  
    from our side of the barrier. The likelihood of a meeting of  
    minds through language depends on the willingness of both  
    reader and writer to work together. Just as teaching will not  
    avail unless there is a reciprocal activity of being taught, so no  
    author, regardless of his skill in writing, can achieve communi-  
    cation without a reciprocal skill on the part of readers. If that  
    were not so, the diverse skills of writing and reading would  
    not bring minds together, however much effort was expended,  
    any more than the men who tunnel through from opposite  
    sides of a mountain would ever meet unless they made their  
    calculations according to the same principles of engineering.
    
    As we have pointed out, each of the rules of interpretive  
    reading involves two steps. To get technical for a moment, we  
    may say that these rules have a grammatical and a logical  
    aspect. The grammatical aspect is the one that deals with  
    words. The logical step deals with their meanings or, more  
    precisely, with terms. So far as communication is concerned,  
    both steps are indispensable. If language is used without  
    thought, nothing is being communicated. And thought or  
    knowledge cannot be communicated without language. As  
    arts, grammar and logic are concerned with language in rela-  
    tion to thought and thought in relation to language. That is  
    why skill in both reading and writing is gained through these  
    arts.
  - |-
    This business of language and thought—especially the distinction between words and terms—is so important that we are going to risk being repetitious to be sure the main point is understood. The main point is that one word can be the vehicle for many terms, and one term can be expressed by many words. Let us illustrate this schematically in the following manner. The word "reading" has been used in many senses in the course of our discussion. Let us take three of these senses: By the word "reading" we may mean (1) reading to be entertained, (2) reading to get information, and (3) reading to achieve understanding.
    
    Now let us symbolize the word "reading" by the letter X, and the three meanings by the letters a, b, and c. What is symbolized in this scheme by Xa, Xb, and Xc, are not three words, for X remains the same throughout. But they are three terms, on the condition, of course, that you, as reader, and we, as writers know when X is being used in one sense and not another. If we write Xa in a given place, and you read Xb, we are writing and you are reading the same word, but not in the same way. The ambiguity prevents or at least impedes communication. Only when you think the word as we think it, do we have one thought between us. Our minds cannot meet in X, but only in Xa or Xb or Xc. Thus we come to terms.
    
    Finding the Key Words  
    We are now prepared to put flesh on the rule that requires  
    
    the reader to come to terms. How does he go about doing it?  
    How does he find the important or key words in a book?
  - |-
    You can be sure of one thing. Not all the words an author uses are important. Better than that, you can be sure that most of his words are not. Only those words that he uses in a special way are important for him, and for us as readers. This is not an absolute matter, of course, but one of degree. Words may be more or less important. Our only concern is with the fact that some words in a book are more important than others. At one extreme are the words that the author uses as the proverbial man in the street does. Since the author is using these words as everyone does in ordinary discourse, the reader should have no trouble with them. He is familiar with their ambiguity and he has grown accustomed to the variation in their meanings as they occur in this context or that.
    
    For example, the word "reading" occurs in A. S. Eddington's book, The Nature of the Physical World. He speaks of "pointer-readings," the readings of dials and gauges on scientific instruments. He is using the word "reading" in one of its ordinary senses. It is not for him a technical word. He can rely on ordinary usage to convey what he means to the reader. Even if he used the word "reading" in a different sense somewhere else in the book—in a phrase, let us say, such as "reading nature"—he could be confident that the reader would note the shift to another of the word's ordinary meanings. The reader who could not do this could not talk to his friends or carry on his daily business.
    
    But Eddington is not able to use the word "cause" so lightheartedly. That may be a word of common speech, but he is using it in a definitely special sense when he discusses the theory of causation. How that word is to be understood makes a difference that both he and the reader must bother about. For the same reason, the word "reading" is important in this book. We cannot get along with merely using it in an ordinary way.

    An author uses most words as men ordinarily do in con-
    versation, with a range of meanings, and trusting to the context
    to indicate the shifts. Knowing this fact is some help in detect-
    ing the more important words. We must not forget, however,
    102 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    that at different times and places the same words are not
    equally familiar items in daily usage. Contemporary writers
    will employ most words as they are ordinarily used today, and
    you will know which words these are because you are alive
    today. But in reading books written in the past, it may be more
    difficult to detect the words the author is using as most people
    did at the time and place he was writing. The fact that some
    authors intentionally employ archaic words, or archaic senses
    of words, complicates the matter further, as does the transla-
    tion of books from foreign languages.
    
    Nevertheless, it remains true that most of the words in
    any book can be read just as one would use them in talking
    to one's friends. Take any page of this book and count the
    words we are using in that way: all the prepositions, conjunc-
    tions, and articles, and almost all of the verbs, nouns, adverbs,
    and adjectives. In this chapter so far, there have been only a
    few important words: "word," "term," ambiguity," "communi-
    cation," and perhaps one or two more. Of these, "term" is
    clearly the most important; all the others are important in
    relation to it.
    
    You cannot locate the key words without making an
    effort to understand the passage in which they occur. This
    situation is somewhat paradoxical. If you do understand the
    passage, you will, of course, know which words in it are the
    most important. If you do not fully understand the passage,
    it is probably because you do not know the way the author is
    using certain words. If you mark the words that trouble you,
    you may hit the very ones the author is using specially. That
    this is likely to be so follows from the fact that you should
    have no trouble with the words the author uses in an ordinary
    way.
  - |-
    From your point of view as a reader, therefore, the most  
    important words are those that give you trouble. It is likely  
    that these words are important for the author as well. However,  
    they may not be.
    
    It is also possible that words that are important for the  
    author do not bother you, and precisely because you under-  
    stand them. In that case, you have already come to terms with  
    the author. Only where you fail to come to terms have you  
    work still to do.
    
    Technical Words and Special Vocabularies
    
    So far we have been proceeding negatively by eliminating  
    the ordinary words. You discover some of the important words  
    by the fact that they are not ordinary for you. That is why they  
    bother you. But is there any other way of spotting the im-  
    portant words? Are there any positive signs that point to them?
    
    There are several. The first and most obvious sign is the  
    explicit stress an author places upon certain words and not  
    others. He may do this in many ways. He may use such typo-  
    graphical devices as quotation marks or italics to mark the  
    word for you. He may call your attention to the word by  
    explicitly discussing its various senses and indicating the way  
    he is going to use it here and there. Or he may emphasize the  
    word by defining the thing that the word is used to name.
    
    No one can read Euclid without knowing that such words  
    as "point," "line," "plane," "angle," "parallel," and so forth are  
    of the first importance. These are the words that name geo-  
    metrical entities defined by Euclid. There are other important  
    words, such as "equals," "whole," and "part," but these do not  
    name anything that is defined. You know they are important  
    from the fact that they occur in the axioms. Euclid helps you  
    here by making his primary propositions explicit at the very  
    beginning. You can guess that the terms composing such propo-  
    sitions are basic, and that underlines for you the words that  
    express these terms. You may have no: difficulty with these  
    words, because they are words of common speech, and Euclid  
    appears to be using them that way.
  - |-
    If all authors wrote as Euclid did, you may say, this business of reading would be much easier. But that of course is not possible, although there have in fact been men who thought that any subject matter could be expounded in the geometrical manner. The procedure—the method of exposition and proof—that works in mathematics is not applicable in every field of knowledge. In any event, for our purposes it is sufficient to note what is common to every sort of exposition.
    Every field of knowledge has its own technical vocabulary. Euclid makes his plain right at the beginning. The same is true of any writer, such as Galileo or Newton, who writes in the geometrical manner. In books differently written or in other fields, the technical vocabulary must be discovered by the reader.
    
    If the author has not pointed out the words himself, the reader may locate them through having some prior knowledge of the subject matter. If he knows something about biology or economics before he begins to read Darwin or Adam Smith, he certainly has some leads toward discerning the technical words. The rules of analyzing a book's structure may help here. If you know what kind of book it is, what it is about as a whole, and what its major parts are, you are greatly aided in separating the technical vocabulary from the ordinary words. The author's title, chapter headings, and preface may be useful in this connection.
    
    From this you know, for example, that "wealth" is a technical word for Adam Smith, and "species" for Darwin. Since one technical word leads to another, you cannot help but discover other technical words in a similar fashion. You can soon make a list of the important words used by Adam Smith: labor, capital, land, wages, profits, rent, commodity, price, exchange, productive, unproductive, money, and so forth. And here are some you cannot miss in Darwin: variety, genus, selection, survival, adaptation, hybrid, fittest, creation.
  - |-
    Where a field of knowledge has a well-established technical vocabulary, the task of locating the important words in a book treating that subject matter is relatively easy. You can spot them positively through having some acquaintance with
    the field, or negatively by knowing what words must be technical, because they are not ordinary. Unfortunately, there are many fields in which a technical vocabulary is not well established.
    
    Philosophers are notorious for having private vocabularies. There are some words, of course, that have a traditional standing in philosophy. Though they may not be used by all writers in the same sense, they are nevertheless technical words in the discussion of certain problems. But philosophers often find it necessary to coin new words, or to take some word from common speech and make it a technical word. This last procedure is likely to be most misleading to the reader who supposes that he knows what the word means, and therefore treats it as an ordinary word. Most good authors, however, anticipating just this confusion, give very explicit warning whenever they adopt the procedure.
    
    In this connection, one clue to an important word is that the author quarrels with other writers about it. When you find an author telling you how a particular word has been used by others, and why he chooses to use it otherwise, you can be sure that word makes a great difference to him.
    
    We have here emphasized the notion of technical vocabulary, but you must not take this too narrowly. The relatively small set of words that express an author's main ideas, his leading concepts, constitutes his special vocabulary. They are the words that carry his analysis, his argument. If he is making an original communication, some of these words are likely to be used by him in a very special way, although he may use others in a fashion that has become traditional in the field. In either case, these are the words that are most important for him. They should be important for you as a reader also, but in addition any other word whose meaning is not clear is important for you.
  - |-
    The trouble with most readers is that they simply do not  
    pay enough attention to words to locate their difficulties. They  
    fail to distinguish the words that they do not understand suffi-  
    ciently from those they do. All the things we have suggested  
    to help you find the important words in a book will be of no  
    avail unless you make a deliberate effort to note the words  
    you must work on to find the terms they convey. The reader  
    who fails to ponder, or at least to mark, the words he does not  
    understand is headed for disaster.
    
    If you are reading a book that can increase your under-  
    standing, it stands to reason that not all of its words will be  
    completely intelligible to you. If you proceed as if they were  
    all ordinary words, all on the same level of general intelligi-  
    bility as the words of a newspaper article, you will make no  
    headway toward interpretation of the book. You might just  
    as well be reading a newspaper, for the book cannot enlighten  
    you if you do not try to understand it.
    
    Most of us are addicted to non-active reading. The out-  
    standing fault of the non-active or undemanding reader is his  
    inattention to words, and his consequent failure to come to  
    terms with the author.
    
    Finding the Meanings
    
    Spotting the important words is only the beginning of the  
    task. It merely locates the places in the text where you have to  
    go to work. There is another part of this fifth rule of reading.  
    Let us turn to that now. Let us suppose you have marked the  
    words that trouble you. What next?
    
    There are two main possibilities. Either the author is  
    using these words in a single sense throughout or he is using  
    them in two or more senses, shifting his meaning from place  
    to place. In the first alternative, the word stands for a single  
    term. A good example of the use of important words so that  
    they are restricted to a single meaning is found in Euclid. In  
    the second alternative, the word stands for several terms.
    
    In the light of these alternatives, your procedure should  
    be as follows, First, try to determine whether the word has  
    108 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    a single meaning or several. If it has a single meaning, try  
    to find the definitions of that term in the text. If it has several  
    meanings, try to find the different meanings and see how they  
    are related. If you are not sure whether it has a single or mul-  
    tiple meaning, try to find the definitions in the text. If you can't  
    find them there, then look for definitions elsewhere.
    
    In other words, you should go to the text and try to find  
    the meanings of the important words. If you can't find them in  
    the text, then you must go to other sources for their meanings.  
    But even if you find the definitions in the text, it is still your  
    task to understand them. You must work out what they mean.  
    You cannot simply read the definitions and think you have  
    understood them.
    
    This is a vital point. If you simply find the definitions of  
    the words and then stop, you will not understand the book.  
    You must work through the definitions to understand them.  
    This is the way to come to terms with the author.
    
    You must not think that you can understand a book by  
    reading only the definitions of its words. You must work  
    through them to understand them.
    
    This is a very important principle. It applies not only to  
    the words that you have marked, but also to all the words in  
    the book. You must not leave any word unexamined, but you  
    must examine each one carefully and work through its mean-  
    ings. This is the way to come to terms with the author.

    one or many meanings. If it has many, try to see how they are
    related. Finally, note the places where the word is used in one
    sense or another, and see if the context gives you any clue to
    the reason for the shift in meaning. This last will enable you
    to follow the word in its change of meanings with the same
    flexibility that characterizes the author's usage.
    
    But, you may complain, everything is clear except the
    main thing. How does one find out what the meanings are?
    The answer, though simple, may appear unsatisfactory. But
    patience and practice will show you otherwise. The answer is
    that you have to discover the meaning of a word you do not
    understand by using the meanings of all the other words in
    the context that you do understand. This must be the way, no
    matter how merry-go-roundish it may seem at first.
    
    The easiest way to illustrate this is to consider a definition.
    A definition is stated in words. If you do not understand any
    of the words used in the definition, you obviously cannot
    understand the meaning of the word that names the thing
    defined. The word "point" is a basic word in geometry. You
    may think you know what it means (in geometry), but Euclid
    wants to be sure you use it in only one way. He tells you what
    he means by first defining the thing he is later going to use
    the word to name. He says: "A point is that which has no part."
    
    How does that help to bring you to terms with him? You
    know, he assumes, what every other word in the sentence
    means with sufficient precision. You know that whatever has
    parts is a complex whole. You know that the opposite of
    complex is simple. To be simple is the same as to lack parts.
    You know that the use of the words "is" and "that which"
    means that the thing referred to must be an entity of some
    sort. Incidentally, it follows from all this that, if there are no
    physical things without parts, a point, as Euclid speaks of it,
    cannot be physical.
    
    This illustration is typical of the process by which you
    acquire meanings. You operate with meanings you already
    possess. If every word that was used in a definition had itself
  - |-

    to be defined, nothing could ever be defined. If every word in
    a book you were reading was entirely strange to you, as in the
    case of a book in a totally foreign language, you could make
    no progress at all.
    
    That is what people mean when they say of a book that it
    is all Greek to them. They simply have not tried to understand
    it, which would be justifiable if it were really in Greek. But
    most of the words in any English book are familiar words.
    These words surround the strange words, the technical words,
    the words that may cause the reader some trouble. The sur-
    rounding words are the context for the words to be interpreted.
    The reader has all the materials he needs to do the job.
    
    We are not pretending the job is an easy one. We are only
    insisting that it is not an impossible one. If it were, no one
    could read a book to gain in understanding. The fact that a
    book can give you new insights or enlighten you indicates that
    it probably contains words you may not readily understand. If
    you could not come to understand those words by your own
    efforts, then the kind of reading we are talking about would
    be impossible. It would be impossible to pass from understand-
    ing less to understanding more by your own operations on a
    book.
    
    There is no rule of thumb for doing this. The process is
    something like the trial-and-error method of putting a jigsaw
    puzzle together. The more parts you put together, the easier
    it is to find places for the remaining parts, if only because there
    are fewer of them. A book comes to you with a large number
    of words already in place. A word in place is a term. It is
    definitely located by the meaning that you and the author
    share in using it. The remaining words must be put in place.
    You do this by trying to make them fit this way or that. The
    better you understand the picture that the words so far in
    place already partially reveal, the easier it is to complete the
    picture by making terms of the remaining words. Each word
    put into place makes the next adjustment easier.
    
    You will make errors, of course, in the process. You will

    think you have managed to find where a word belongs and
    how it fits, only to discover later that the placement of another
    word requires you to make a whole series of readjustments.
    The errors will get corrected because, so long as they are not
    found out, the picture cannot be completed. Once you have
    had any experience at all in this work of coming to terms, you
    will soon be able to check yourself. You will know whether you
    have succeeded or not. You will not blithely think you under-
    stand when you do not.
    
    In comparing a book to a jigsaw puzzle, we have made
    one assumption that is not true. A good puzzle is, of course,
    one all of whose parts fit. The picture can be perfectly com-
    pleted. The same is true of the ideally good book, but there is
    no such book. In proportion as books are good, their terms
    will be so well made and put together by the author that the
    reader can do the work of interpretation fruitfully. Here, as in
    the case of every other rule of reading, bad books are less
    readable than good ones. The rules do not work on them, ex-
    cept to show you how bad they are. If the author uses words
    ambiguously you cannot find out what he is trying to say. You
    can only find out that he has not been precise.
    
    But, you may ask, does not an author who uses a word in
    more than a single sense use it ambiguously? And is it not the
    usual practice for authors to use words in several senses,
    especially their most important words?
    
    The answer to the first question is No; to the second, Yes.
    To use a word ambiguously is to use it in several senses with-
    out distinguishing or relating their meanings. (For example,
    we have probably used the word "important" ambiguously in
    this chapter, for we were not always clear as to whether we
    meant important for the author or important for you.) The
    author who does that has not made terms that the reader can
    come to. But the author who distinguishes the several senses
    in which he is using a critical word and enables the reader to
    make a responsive discrimination is offering terms.
    
    You should not forget that one word can represent several

    terms. One way to remember this is to distinguish between the
    author's vocabulary and his terminology. If you make a list in
    one column of the important words, and in another of their
    important meanings, you will see the relation between the
    vocabulary and the terminology.
    
    There are several further complications. In the first place,
    a word that has several distinct meanings can be used either
    in a single sense or in a combination of senses. Let us take the
    word "reading" again as an example. In some places, we have
    used it to stand for reading any kind of book. In others, we
    have used it to stand for reading books that instruct rather
    than entertain. In still others, we have used it to stand for
    reading that enlightens rather than informs.
    
    Now if we symbolize here, as we did before, these three
    distinct meanings of "reading" by Xa, Xb, and Xc, then the first
    usage just mentioned is Xabc, the second is Xbc, and the third
    Xc. In other words, if several meanings are related, one can
    use a word to stand for all of them, for some of them, or for
    only one of them at a time. So long as each usage is definite,
    the word so used is a term.
    
    In the second place, there is the problem of synonyms.
    The repetition of a single word over and over is awkward and
    boring, except in mathematical writing, and so good authors
    often substitute different words having the same or very
    similar meanings for important words in their text. This is
    just the opposite of the situation where one word can stand
    for several terms; here, one and the same term is represented
    by two or more words used synonymously.
    
    We can express this symbolically as follows. Let X and Y
    be two different words, such as "enlightenment" and "insight."
    Let the letter a stand for the same meaning that each can
    express, namely, a gain in understanding. Then Xa and Ya
    represent the same term, though they are distinct as words.
    When we speak of reading "for insight" and reading "for
    "enlightenment," we are referring to the same kind of reading,
    because the two phrases are being used with the same mean-

    ing. The words are different, but there is only one term for
    you as a reader to grasp.
    
    This is important, of course. If you supposed that every
    time an author changed his words, he was shifting his terms,
    you would make as great an error as to suppose that every
    time he used the same words, the terms remained the same.
    Keep this in mind when you list the author's vocabulary and
    terminology in separate columns. You will find two relation-
    ships. On the one hand, a single word may be related to
    several terms. On the other hand, a single term may be related
    to several words.
    
    In the third place, and finally, there is the matter of
    phrases. If a phrase is a unit, that is, if it is a whole that can be
    the subject or predicate of a sentence, it is like a single word.
    Like a single word, it can refer to something being talked
    about in some way.
    
    It follows, therefore, that a term can be expressed by a
    phrase as well as by a word. And all the relations that exist
    between words and terms hold also between terms and phrases.
    Two phrases may express the same term, and one phrase may
    express several terms, according to the way its constituent
    words are used.
    
    In general, a phrase is less likely to be ambiguous than a
    word. Because it is a group of words, each of which is in the
    context of the others, the single words are more likely to have
    restricted meanings. That is why a writer is likely to substitute
    a fairly elaborate phrase for a single word if he wants to be
    sure that you get his meaning.
    
    One illustration should suffice. To be sure that you come
    to terms with us about reading, we substitute phrases like
    "reading for enlightenment" for the single word "reading." To
    make doubly sure, we may substitute a more elaborate phrase,
    such as "the process of passing from understanding less to
    understanding more by the operation of your mind upon a
    book." There is only one term here, a term referring to the
    kind of reading that this book is mostly about. But that one
    term has been expressed by a single word, a short phrase, and
    a longer one.
  - |-
    This has been a hard chapter to write, and probably a
    hard one to read. The reason is clear. The rule of reading we
    have been discussing cannot be made fully intelligible without
    going into all sorts of grammatical and logical explanations
    about words and terms.
    
    In fact, we have actually done very little explaining. To
    give an adequate account of these matters would take many
    chapters. We have merely touched upon the most essential
    points. We hope we have said enough to make the rule a
    useful guide in practice. The more you put it into practice,
    the more you will appreciate the intricacies of the problem.
    You will want to know something about the literal and meta-
    phorical use of words. You will want to know about the dis-
    tinction between abstract and concrete words, and between
    proper and common names. You will become interested in the
    whole business of definition: the difference between defining
    words and defining things; why some words are indefinable,
    and yet have definite meanings, and so forth. You will seek
    light on what is called "the emotive use of words," that is, the
    use of words to arouse emotions, to move men to action or
    change their minds, as distinct from the communication of
    knowledge. And you may even become interested in the rela-
    tion between ordinary "rational" speech and "bizarre" or
    "crazy" talk—the speech of the mentally disturbed, where al-
    most every word carries weird and unexpected but neverthe-
    less identifiable connotations.
    
    If the practice of analytical reading elicits these further
    interests, you will be in a position to satisfy them by reading
    books on these special subjects. And you will profit more from
    reading such books, because you will go to them with questions
    born of your own experience in reading. The study of grammar
    and logic, the sciences that underlie these rules, is practical
    only to the extent you can relate it to practice.
    
    You may never wish to go further. But even if you do not,
    Coming to Terms With an Author 113
    
    you will find that your comprehension of any book will be
    enormously increased if you only go to the trouble of finding
    its important words, identifying their shifting meanings, and
    coming to terms. Seldom does such a small change in a habit
    have such a large effect.
  - |-
    DETERMINING  
    AN AUTHOR'S MESSAGE  
    
    Not only coming to terms but also making propositions occurs  
    among traders as well as in the world of books. What a buyer  
    or seller means by a proposition is some sort of proposal, some  
    sort of offer or acceptance. In honest dealings, the person who  
    makes a proposition in this sense is declaring his intention to  
    act in a certain way. More than honesty is required for suc-  
    cessful negotiations. The proposition should be clear and, of  
    course, attractive. Then the traders can come to terms.
    
    A proposition in a book is also a declaration. It is an  
    expression of the author's judgment about something. He  
    affirms something he thinks to be true, or denies something he  
    judges to be false. He asserts this or that to be a fact. A propo-  
    sition of this sort is a declaration of knowledge, not intentions.  
    The author may tell us his intentions at the beginning in a  
    preface. In an expository book, he usually promises to instruct  
    us about something. To find out whether he keeps those prom-  
    ises, we must look for his propositions.
    
    Generally, the order of reading reverses the order of busi-  
    ness. Businessmen usually come to terms after they find out  
    what the proposition is, But the reader must usually come to  
    terms with an author first, before he can find out what the  
    author is proposing, what judgment he is declaring. That is  
    why the fifth rule of analytical reading concerns words and  
    
    114  
    Determining an Author's Message 115  
    
    terms, and the sixth, which we are about to discuss, concerns  
    sentences and propositions.
    
    There is a seventh rule that is closely related to the sixth.  
    The author may be honest in declaring himself on matters of  
    fact or knowledge. We usually proceed in that trust. But un-  
    less we are exclusively interested in the author's personality,  
    we should not be satisfied with knowing what his opinions  
    are. His propositions are nothing but expressions of personal  
    opinion unless they are supported by reasons. If it is the book  
    and the subject with which it deals that we are interested in,  
    and not just the author, we want to know not merely what his  
    propositions are, but also why he thinks we should be per-  
    suaded to accept them.
  - |-
    The seventh rule, therefore, deals with arguments of all  
    sorts. There are many kinds of reasoning, many ways of sup-  
    porting what one says. Sometimes it is possible to argue that  
    something is true; sometimes no more than a probability can  
    be defended. But every sort of argument consists of a number  
    of statements related in a certain way. This is said because of  
    that. The word "because" here signifies a reason being given.
    
    The presence of arguments is indicated by other words  
    that relate statements, such as: if this is so, then that; or, since  
    this, therefore that; or, it follows from this, that that is the case.  
    In the course of earlier chapters in this book, such sequences  
    occurred. For those of us who are no longer in school, we  
    observed, it is necessary, if we want to go on learning and  
    discovering, to know how to make books teach us well. In that  
    situation, if we want to go on learning, then we must know  
    how to learn from books, which are absent teachers.
    
    An argument is always a set or series of statements of  
    which some provide the grounds or reasons for what is to be  
    concluded. A paragraph, therefore, or at least a collection of  
    sentences, is required to express an argument. The premises  
    or principles of an argument may not always be stated first,  
    but they are the source of the conclusion, nevertheless. If the  
    argument is valid, the conclusion follows from the premises.
    
    116 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    That does not necessarily mean that the conclusion is true,  
    since one or all of the premises that support it may be false.
  - |-
    There is a grammatical as well as a logical aspect to the order of these rules of interpretation. We go from terms to propositions to arguments, by going from words (and phrases) to sentences to collections of sentences (or paragraphs). We are building up from simpler to more complex units. The smallest significant element in a book is, of course, a single word. It would be true but not adequate to say that a book consists of words. It also consists of groups of words, taken as units, and similarly of groups of sentences, taken as units. The active reader is attentive not only to the words but also to the sentences and paragraphs. There is no other way of discovering the author's terms, propositions, and arguments.
    
    The movement at this stage of analytical reading—when interpretation is our goal—seems to be in the opposite direction from the movement in the first stage—when the goal was a structural outline. There we went from the book as a whole to its major parts, and then to their subordinate divisions. As you might suspect, the two movements meet somewhere. The major parts of a book and their principal divisions contain many propositions and usually several arguments. But if you keep on dividing the book into its parts, at last you have to say: "In this part, the following points are made." Now each of these points is likely to be a proposition, and some of them taken together probably form an argument.
    
    Thus, the two processes, outlining and interpretation, meet at the level of propositions and arguments. You work down to propositions and arguments by dividing the book into its parts. You work up to arguments by seeing how they are composed of propositions and ultimately of terms. When you have completed the two processes, you can really say that you know the contents of a book.
    
    Determining an Author's Message 117
    
    Sentences vs. Propositions
    
    We have already noticed another thing about the rules we are going to discuss in this chapter. As in the case of the rule about words and terms, we are here also dealing with the relation of language and thought. Sentences and paragraphs are grammatical units. They are units of language. Propositions and arguments are logical units, or units of thought and knowledge.
  - |-
    We have to face here a problem similar to the one we
    faced in the last chapter. Because language is not a perfect
    medium for the expression of thought, because one word can
    have many meanings and two or more words can have the
    same meaning, we saw how complicated was the relation be-
    tween an author's vocabulary and his terminology. One word
    may represent several terms, and one term may be represented
    by several words.
    
    Mathematicians describe the relation between the buttons
    and the buttonholes on a well-made coat as a one-to-one rela-
    tionship. There is a button for every buttonhole, and a hole
    for every button. Well, the point is that words and terms do
    not stand in a one-to-one relation. The greatest error you can
    make in applying these rules is to suppose that a one-to-one
    relationship exists between the elements of language and those
    of thought or knowledge.
    
    As a matter of fact, it would be wise not to make too easy
    assumptions even about buttons and buttonholes. The sleeves
    of most men's suit jackets bear buttons that have no corre-
    sponding buttonholes. And if you have worn the coat for a
    while, it may have a hole with no corresponding button.
    
    Let us illustrate this in the case of sentences and proposi-
    tions. Not every sentence in a book expresses a proposition. For
    one thing, some sentences express questions. They state prob-
    lems rather than answers. Propositions are the answers to
    questions. They are declarations of knowledge or opinion. That
    118 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    is why we call sentences that express them declarative, and
    distinguish sentences that ask questions as interrogative. Other
    sentences express wishes or intentions. They may give us some
    knowledge of the author's purpose, but they do not convey the
    knowledge he is trying to expound.
  - |-
    Moreover, not all the declarative sentences can be read as if each expressed one proposition. There are at least two reasons for this. The first is the fact that words are ambiguous and can be used in various sentences. Thus, it is possible for the same sentence to express different propositions if there is a shift in the terms the words express. "Reading is learning" is a simple sentence; but if at one place we mean by "learning" the acquisition of information, and at another we mean the development of understanding, the proposition is not the same, because the terms are different. Yet the sentence is the same.
    
    The second reason is that all sentences are not as simple as "Reading is learning." When its words are used unambiguously, a simple sentence usually expresses a single proposition. But even when its words are used unambiguously, a compound sentence expresses two or more propositions. A compound sentence is really a collection of sentences, connected by such words as "and," or "if... then," or "not only... but also." You may rightly conclude that the line between a long compound sentence and a short paragraph may be difficult to draw. A compound sentence can express a number of propositions related in the form of an argument.
    
    Such sentences can be very difficult to interpret. Let us take an interesting sentence from Machiavelli's The Prince to show what we mean:
    
    A prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he abstains from the property of his citizens and from their women.
    
    This is grammatically a single sentence, though it is extremely complex. The semicolon and the "because" indicate the major break in it. The first proposition is that a prince ought to inspire fear in a certain way.
  - |-
    Beginning with the word "because," we have what is in effect another sentence. (It could be made independent by saying: "The reason for this is that he can endure," and so forth.) And this sentence expresses two propositions at least: (1) the reason why the prince ought to inspire fear in a certain way is that he can endure being feared so long as he is not hated; (2) he can avoid being hated only by keeping his hands off the property of his citizens and their women.
    
    It is important to distinguish the various propositions that a long, complex sentence contains. In order to agree or disagree with Machiavelli, you must first understand what he is saying. But he is saying three things in this one sentence. You may disagree with one of them and agree with the others. You may think Machiavelli is wrong in recommending terrorism to a prince on any grounds; but you may acknowledge his shrewdness in saying that the prince had better not arouse hatred along with fear, and you may also agree that keeping his hands off his subjects' property and women is an indispensable condition of not being hated. Unless you recognize the distinct propositions in a complicated sentence, you cannot make a discriminating judgment on what the writer is saying.
    
    Lawyers know this fact very well. They have to examine sentences carefully to see what is being alleged by the plaintiff or denied by the defendant. The single sentence, "John Doe signed the lease on March 24," looks simple enough, but still it says several things, some of which may be true and the others false. John Doe may have signed the lease, but not on March 24, and that fact may be important. In short, even a grammatically simple sentence sometimes expresses two or more propositions.
    
    We have said enough to indicate what we mean by the difference between sentences and propositions. They are not related as one to one. Not only can a single sentence express several propositions, either through ambiguity or complexity, but one and the same proposition can also be expressed by two

    or more different sentences. If you grasp our terms through
    the words and phrases we use synonymously, you will know
    that we are saying the same thing when we say, "Teaching
    and being taught are correlative functions," and "Initiating and
    receiving communication are related processes."
    
    We are going to stop explaining the grammatical and logi-
    cal points involved and turn to the rules. The difficulty in this
    chapter, as in the last, is to stop explaining. Instead, we will
    assume that you know some grammar. We do not necessarily
    mean that you must understand everything about syntax, but
    you should be concerned about the ordering of words in sen-
    tences and their relation to one another. Some knowledge of
    grammar is indispensable to a reader. You cannot begin to
    deal with terms, propositions, and arguments—the elements of
    thought—until you can penetrate beneath the surface of lan-
    guage. So long as words, sentences, and paragraphs are opaque
    and unanalyzed, they are a barrier to, rather than a medium
    of, communication. You will read words but not receive knowl-
    edge.
    
    Here are the rules. The fifth rule of reading, as you will
    recall from the last chapter, was: RULE 5. FIND THE IMPORTANT
    WORDS AND COME TO TERMS. The sixth rule can be expressed
    thus: RuLE 6. MARK THE MOST IMPORTANT SENTENCES IN A BOOK
    AND DISCOVER THE PROPOSITIONS THEY CONTAIN. The seventh
    rule is this: RULE 7. LOCATE OR CONSTRUCT THE BASIC ARGU-
    MENTS IN THE BOOK BY FINDING THEM IN THE CONNECTION OF
    SENTENCES. You will see later why we did not say "paragraphs"
    in the formulation of this rule.
    
    Incidentally, it is just as true of these new rules as it was
    of the rule about coming to terms that they apply primarily to
    expository works. The rules about propositions and arguments
    are quite different when you are reading a poetical work—a
    novel, play, or poem. We will discuss the changes that are
    required in applying them to such works later.
    Determining an Author's Message 121
    
    Finding the Key Sentences
    
    How does one locate the most important sentences in a
    book? How, then, does one interpret these sentences to discover
    the one or more propositions they contain?
  - |-
    Again, we are placing emphasis on what is important. To say that there is only a relatively small number of key sentences in a book does not mean that you need pay no attention to all the rest. Obviously, you have to understand every sentence. But most of the sentences, like most of the words, will cause you no difficulty. As we pointed out in our discussion of reading speeds, you will read them relatively quickly. From your point of view as a reader, the sentences important for you are those that require an effort of interpretation because, at first sight, they are not perfectly intelligible. You understand them just well enough to know there is more to understand. They are the sentences that you read much more slowly and carefully than the rest. These may not be the sentences that are most important for the author, but they are likely to be, because you are likely to have the greatest difficulty with the most important things the author has to say. And it hardly needs remarking that those are the things you should read most carefully.
    
    From the author's point of view, the important sentences are the ones that express the judgments on which his whole argument rests. A book usually contains much more than the bare statement of an argument, or a series of arguments. The author may explain how he came to the point of view he now holds, or why he thinks his position has serious consequences. He may discuss the words he has to use. He may comment on the work of others. He may indulge in all sorts of supporting and surrounding discussion. But the heart of his communication lies in the major affirmations and denials he is making, and the reasons he gives for so doing. To come to grips, therefore, you have to see the main sentences as if they were raised from the page in high relief.
  - |-
    Some authors help you do this. They underline the sentences for you. They either tell you that this is an important point when they make it, or they use one or another typographical device to make their leading sentences stand out.
    Of course, nothing helps those who will not keep awake while reading. We have met many readers and students who paid no attention even to such clear signs. They preferred to read on rather than stop and examine the important sentences carefully.
    
    There are a few books in which the leading propositions are set forth in sentences that occupy a special place in the order and style of the exposition. Euclid, again, gives us the most obvious example of this. He not only states his definitions, his postulates, and his axioms—his principal propositions—at the beginning, but he also labels every proposition to be proved. You may not understand all of his statements. You may not follow all of his arguments. But you cannot miss the important sentences or the grouping of sentences for the statement of the proofs.
    
    The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas is another book whose style of exposition puts the leading sentences into high relief. It proceeds by raising questions. Each section is headed by a question. There are many indications of the answer that Aquinas is trying to defend. A whole series of objections opposing the answer is stated. The place where Aquinas begins to argue his own point is marked by the words, "I answer that." There is no excuse for not being able to locate the important sentences in such a book—those expressing the reasons as well as the conclusions—yet even here it remains all a blur for those readers who treat everything they read as equally important—and read it all at the same speed, either fast or slow. That usually means that everything is equally unimportant.
    
    Apart from books whose style or format calls attention to what most needs interpretation by the reader, the spotting of
  - |-
    The important sentences is a job the reader must perform for himself. There are several things he can do. We have already mentioned one. If he is sensitive to the difference between passages he can understand readily and those he cannot, he will probably be able to locate the sentences that carry the main burden of meaning. Perhaps you are beginning to see how essential a part of reading it is to be perplexed and know it. Wonder is the beginning of wisdom in learning from books as well as from nature. If you never ask yourself any questions about the meaning of a passage, you cannot expect the book to give you any insight you do not already possess.
    
    Another clue to the important sentences is found in the words that compose them. If you have already marked the important words, they should lead you to the sentences that deserve further attention. Thus the first step in interpretive reading prepares for the second. But the reverse may also be the case. It may be that you will mark certain words only after you have become puzzled by the meaning of a sentence. The fact that we have stated these rules in a fixed order does not mean that you have to follow them in that order. Terms constitute propositions. Propositions contain terms. If you know the terms the words express, you have caught the proposition in the sentence. If you understand the proposition conveyed by a sentence, you have arrived at the terms also.
    
    This suggests one further clue to the location of the principal propositions. They must belong to the main argument of the book. They must be either premises or conclusions. Hence, if you can detect those sentences that seem to form a sequence, a sequence in which there is a beginning and an end, you probably have put your finger on the sentences that are important.
    
    We said a sequence in which there is a beginning and an end. Every argument that men can express in words takes time to state. You may speak a sentence in one breath, but there are pauses in an argument. You have to say one thing first, then another, and then another. An argument begins somewhere,
  - |-
    It goes somewhere, gets somewhere. It is a movement of thought.
    It may begin with what is really the conclusion and then pro-
    ceed to give the reasons for it. Or it may start with the evidence
    and the reasons and bring you to the conclusion that follows
    therefrom.
    
    Of course, here as elsewhere, the clue will not work unless
    you know how to use it. You have to recognize an argument
    when you see one. Despite some disappointing experiences,
    however, we persist in our opinion that the human mind is as
    naturally sensitive to arguments as the eye is to colors. (There
    may be some people who are argument-blind!) But the eye
    will not see if it is not kept open, and the mind will not follow
    an argument if it is not awake.
    
    Many persons believe that they know how to read because
    they read at different speeds. But they pause and go slow
    over the wrong sentences. They pause over the sentences that
    interest them rather than the ones that puzzle them. Indeed,
    this is one of the greatest obstacles to reading a book that is
    not completely contemporary. Any old book contains facts that
    are somewhat surprising because they are different from what
    we know. But when you are reading for understanding it is not
    that kind of novelty that you are seeking. Your interest in the
    author himself, or in his language, or in the world in which he
    wrote, is one thing; your concern to understand his ideas is
    quite another. It is this concern that the rules we are discuss-
    ing here can help you to satisfy, not your curiosity about other
    matters.
    
    Finding the Propositions
    
    Let us suppose that you have located the leading sen-
    tences, Another step is required by Rule 6. You must discover
    the proposition or propositions that each of these sentences
    contains. This is just another way of saying that you must
    know what the sentence means. You discover terms by discov-
    ering what a word means in a given usage. You discover propo-
    sitions similarly by interpreting all the words that make up the
    sentence, and especially its principal words.
  - |-
    Once more, you cannot do this very well unless you know  
    a little grammar. You must know the role that adjectives and  
    adverbs play, how verbs function in relation to nouns, how  
    modifying words and clauses restrict or amplify the meaning  
    of the words they modify, and so forth. Ideally, you should be  
    able to dissect a sentence according to the rules of syntax,  
    although you do not necessarily have to do it in a formal  
    way. Despite the current de-emphasis on teaching grammar in  
    school, we have to assume that you know this much of it. We  
    cannot believe you do not, though you may have grown a  
    little rusty from lack of practice in the rudiments of the art  
    of reading.
    
    There are only two differences between finding the terms  
    that words express and the propositions that sentences express.  
    One is that you employ a larger context in the latter case. You  
    bring all the surrounding sentences to bear on the sentence in  
    question, just as you used the surrounding words to interpret  
    a particular word. In both cases, you proceed from what you  
    do understand to the gradual elucidation of what is at first  
    relatively unintelligible.
    
    The other difference lies in the fact that complicated sen-  
    tences usually express more than one proposition. You have not  
    completed your interpretation of an important sentence until  
    you have separated out of it all the different, though perhaps  
    related, propositions. Skill in doing this comes with practice.  
    Take some of the complicated sentences in this book and try  
    to state in your own words each of the things that is being  
    asserted. Number them and relate them.
    
    "State in your own words!" That suggests the best test we  
    know for telling whether you have understood the proposition  
    or propositions in the sentence. If, when you are asked to ex-  
    plain what the author means by a particular sentence, all you  
    can do is repeat his very words, with some minor alterations
  - |-
    In their order, you had better suspect that you do not know
    what he means. Ideally, you should be able to say the same
    thing in totally different words. The idea can, of course, be
    approximated in varying degrees. But if you cannot get away
    at all from the author's words, it shows that only words have
    passed from him to you, not thought or knowledge. You know
    his words, not his mind. He was trying to communicate knowl-
    edge, and all you received was words.
    
    The process of translation from a foreign language to
    English is relevant to the test we have suggested. If you can-
    not state in an English sentence what a French sentence says,
    you know you do not understand the meaning of the French.
    But even if you can, your translation may remain only on the
    verbal level; for even when you have formed a faithful English
    replica, you still may not know what the writer of the French
    sentence was trying to convey.
    
    The translation of one English sentence into another, how-
    ever, is not merely verbal. The new sentence you have formed
    is not a verbal replica of the original. If accurate, it is faithful
    to the thought alone. That is why making such translations is
    the best test you can apply to yourself, if you want to be sure
    you have digested the proposition, not merely swallowed the
    words. If you fail the test, you have uncovered a failure of
    understanding. If you say that you know what the author
    means, but can only repeat the author's sentence to show that
    you do, then you would not be able to recognize the author's
    proposition if it were presented to you in other words.
    
    The author may himself express the same proposition in
    different words in the course of his writing. The reader who
    has not seen through the words to the proposition they convey
    is likely to treat the equivalent sentences as if they were state-
    ments of different propositions. Imagine a person who did not
    know that "2 + 2 = 4" and "4 — 2 = 2" were different nota-
    tions for the same arithmetic relationship—the relationship of
    four as the double of two, or two as the half of four.
    
    You would have to conclude that that person simply did
    Determining an Author's Message 127
  - |-
    I do not understand the equation. The same conclusion is forced on you concerning yourself or anybody else who cannot tell when equivalent statements of the same proposition are being made, or who cannot himself offer an equivalent statement when he claims to understand the proposition a sentence contains.
    
    These remarks have a bearing on syntopical reading—the reading of several books about the same subject matter. Different authors frequently say the same thing in different words, or different things using almost the same words. The reader who cannot see through the language to the terms and propositions will never be able to compare such related works. Because of their verbal differences, he is likely to misread the authors as disagreeing, or to ignore their real differences because of verbal resemblances in their statements.
    
    There is one other test of whether you understand the proposition in a sentence you have read. Can you point to some experience you have had that the proposition describes or to which the proposition is in any way relevant? Can you exemplify the general truth that has been enunciated by referring to a particular instance of it? To imagine a possible case is often as good as citing an actual one. If you cannot do anything at all to exemplify or illustrate the proposition, either imaginatively or by reference to actual experiences, you should suspect that you do not know what is being said.
    
    Not all propositions are equally susceptible to this test. It, may be necessary to have the special experience that only a laboratory can afford to be sure you have grasped certain scientific propositions. But the main point is clear. Propositions do not exist in a vacuum. They refer to the world in which we live. Unless you can show some acquaintance with actual or possible facts to which the proposition refers or is relevant somehow, you are playing with words, not dealing with thought and knowledge.
    
    Let us consider one example of this. A basic proposition in metaphysics is expressed by the following words: "Nothing acts except what is actual." We have heard many students re-
  - |-
    peat those words to us with an air of satisfied wisdom. They  
    have thought they were discharging their duty to us and to the  
    author by so perfect a verbal repetition. But the sham was  
    obvious as soon as we asked them to state the proposition in  
    other words. Seldom could they say, for instance, that if some-  
    thing does not exist, it cannot do anything. Yet this is an im-  
    mediately apparent translation—apparent, at least, to anyone  
    who understood the proposition in the original sense.  
    
    Failing to get a translation, we would then ask for an  
    exemplification of the proposition. If any one of them told us  
    that grass is not made to grow by merely possible showers—  
    that one's bank account does not increase on account of a  
    merely possible raise—-we would know that the proposition  
    had been grasped.  
    
    The vice of "verbalism" can be defined as the bad habit  
    of using words without regard for the thoughts they should  
    convey and without awareness of the experiences to which  
    they should refer. It is playing with words. As the two tests we  
    have suggested indicate, "verbalism" is the besetting sin of  
    those who fail to read analytically. Such readers never get be-  
    yond the words. They possess what they read as a verbal  
    memory that they can recite emptily. One of the charges made  
    by certain modern educators against the liberal arts is that they  
    tend to verbalism, but just the opposite seems to be the case.  
    The failure in reading—the omnipresent verbalism—of those  
    who have not been trained in the arts of grammar and logic  
    shows how lack of such discipline results in slavery to words  
    rather than mastery of them.  
    
    Finding the Arguments  
    
    We have spent enough time on propositions. Let us now  
    turn to the seventh rule of analytical reading, which requires  
    the reader to deal with collections of sentences. We said before  
    that there was a reason for not formulating this rule of inter-
  - |-

    interpretation by saying that the reader should find the most im-
    portant paragraphs. The reason is that there are no settled con-
    ventions among writers about how to construct paragraphs.
    Some great writers, such as Montaigne, Locke, or Proust, write
    extremely long paragraphs; others, such as Machiavelli, Hobbes,
    or Tolstoy, write relatively short ones. In recent times, under
    the influence of newspaper and magazine style, most writers
    tend to cut their paragraphs to fit quick and easy reading, This
    paragraph, for instance, is probably too long. If we had wanted
    to coddle our readers, we should have started a new one with
    the words, "Some great writers."
    
    It is not merely a matter of length. The point that is
    troublesome here has to do with the relation between lan-
    guage and thought. The logical unit to which the seventh rule
    directs our reading is the argument—a sequence of proposi-
    tions, some of which give reasons for another. This logical unit
    is not uniquely related to any recognizable unit of writing, as
    terms are related to words and phrases, and propositions to
    sentences. An argument may be expressed in a single compli-
    cated sentence. Or it may be expressed in a number of sen-
    tences that are only part of one paragraph. Sometimes an argu-
    ment may coincide with a paragraph, but it may also happen
    that an argument runs through several or many paragraphs.
    
    There is one further difficulty. There are many paragraphs
    in any book that do not express an argument at all—perhaps not
    even part of one. They may consist of collections of sentences
    that detail evidence or report how the evidence has been
    gathered. As there are sentences that are of secondary impor-
    tance, because they are merely digressions or side remarks, so
    also can there be paragraphs of this sort. It hardly needs to be
    said that they should be read rather quickly.
  - |-
    Because of all this, we suggest another formulation of Rue 7, as follows: FIND IF YOU CAN THE PARAGRAPHS IN A BOOK THAT STATE ITS IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS; BUT IF THE ARGUMENTS ARE NOT THUS EXPRESSED, YOUR TASK IS TO CONSTRUCT THEM, BY TAKING A SENTENCE FROM THIS PARAGRAPH, AND ONE
    
    130 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    FROM THAT, UNTIL YOU HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER THE SEQUENCE OF SENTENCES THAT STATE THE PROPOSITIONS THAT COMPOSE THE ARGUMENT,
    
    After you have discovered the leading sentences, the construction of paragraphs should be relatively easy. There are various ways of doing this. You can do it by actually writing out on a piece of paper the propositions that together form an argument. But usually a better way, as we have already suggested, is to put numbers in the margin, together with other marks, to indicate the places where the sentences occur that should be tied together in a sequence.
    
    Authors are more or less helpful to their readers in this matter of making the arguments plain. Good expository authors try to reveal, not conceal, their thought. Yet not even all good authors do this in the same way. Some, such as Euclid, Galileo, Newton (authors who write in a geometrical or mathematical style), come close to the ideal of making a single paragraph an argumentative unit. The style of most writing in non-mathematical fields tends to present two or more arguments in a single paragraph or to have an argument run through several.
    
    In proportion as a book is more loosely constructed, the paragraphs tend to become more diffuse. You often have to search through all the paragraphs of a chapter to find the sentences you can construct into a statement of a single argument. Some books make you search in vain, and some do not even encourage the search.
  - |-
    A good book usually summarizes itself as its arguments develop. If the author summarizes his arguments for you at the end of a chapter, or at the end of an elaborate section, you should be able to look back over the preceding pages and find the materials he has brought together in the summary. In The Origin of Species, Darwin summarizes his whole argument for the reader in a last chapter, entitled "Recapitulation and Conclusion." The reader who has worked through the book deserves that help. The one who has not cannot use it.
    
    Incidentally, if you have inspected the book well before beginning to read it analytically, you will know whether the summary passages exist and if they do, where they are. You can then make the best possible use of them when interpreting the book.
    
    Another sign of a bad or loosely constructed book is the omission of steps in an argument. Sometimes they can be omitted without damage or inconvenience, because the propositions left out can be generally supplied from the common knowledge of readers. But sometimes their omission is misleading, and may even be intended to mislead. One of the most familiar tricks of the orator or propagandist is to leave certain things unsaid, things that are highly relevant to the argument, but that might be challenged if they were made explicit. While we do not expect such devices in an honest author whose aim is to instruct us, it is nevertheless a sound maxim of careful reading to make every step in an argument explicit.
    
    Whatever kind of book it is, your obligation as a reader remains the same. If the book contains arguments, you must know what they are, and be able to put them into a nutshell. Any good argument can be put into a nutshell. There are, of course, arguments built upon arguments. In the course of an elaborate analysis, one thing may be proved in order to prove another, and this may be used in turn to make a still further point. The units of reasoning, however, are single arguments. If you can find these in any book you are reading, you are not likely to miss the larger sequences.
  - |-
    This is all very well to say, you may object, but unless one  
    knows the structure of arguments as a logician does, how can  
    one be expected to find them in a book, or worse, to construct  
    them when the author does not state them compactly in a  
    single paragraph?
    
    The answer is that it must be obvious that you do not have  
    to know about arguments "as a logician does." There are rela-  
    tively few logicians in the world, for better or for worse. Most  
    of the books that convey knowledge and can instruct us con-  
    tain arguments. They are intended for the general reader, not  
    for specialists in logic.
    
    No great logical competence is needed to read these books.  
    
    132 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    To repeat what we said before, the nature of the human mind  
    is such that if it works at all during the process of reading, if it  
    comes to terms with the author and reaches his propositions,  
    it will see his arguments as well.
    
    There are, however, a few things we can say that may be  
    helpful to you in carrying out this rule of reading. In the first  
    place, remember that every argument must involve a number  
    of statements. Of these, some give the reasons why you should  
    accept a conclusion the author is proposing. If you find the  
    conclusion first, then look for the reasons. If you find the rea-  
    sons first, see where they lead.
    
    In the second place, discriminate between the kind of  
    argument that points to one or more particular facts as evi-  
    dence for some generalization and the kind that offers a series  
    of general statements to prove some further generalizations.  
    The former kind of reasoning is usually referred to as inductive,  
    the latter as deductive; but the names are not what is impor-  
    tant. What is important is the ability to discriminate between  
    the two.
  - |-
    In the literature of science, this distinction is observed whenever the difference is emphasized between the proof of a proposition by reasoning and its establishment by experiment. Galileo, in his Two New Sciences, speaks of illustrating by experiment conclusions that have already been reached by mathematical demonstration. And in a concluding chapter of his book On the Motion of the Heart, the great physiologist William Harvey writes: "It has been shown by reason and experiment that blood by the beat of the ventricles flows through the lungs and heart and is pumped to the whole body." Sometimes it is possible to support a proposition both by reasoning from other general truths and by offering experimental evidence. Sometimes only one method of argument is available.
    
    In the third place, observe what things the author says he must assume, what he says can be proved or otherwise evidenced, and what need not be proved because it is self-evident. He may honestly try to tell you what all his assumptions are, or he may just as honestly leave you to find them out for yourself. Obviously, not everything can be proved, just as not everything can be defined. If every proposition had to be proved, there would be no beginning to any proof. Such things as axioms and assumptions or postulates are needed for the proof of other propositions. If these other propositions are proved, they can, of course, be used as premises in further proofs.
    
    Every line of argument, in other words, must start somewhere. Basically, there are two ways or places in which it can start: with assumptions agreed on between writer and reader, or with what are called self-evident propositions, which neither the writer nor reader can deny. In the first case, the assumptions can be anything, so long as agreement exists. The second case requires some further comment here.
  - |-
    In recent times, it has become commonplace to refer to self-evident propositions as "tautologies"; the feeling behind the term is sometimes one of contempt for the trivial, or a suspicion of legerdemain. Rabbits are being pulled out of a hat. You put the truth in by defining your words, and then pull it out as if you were surprised to find it there. That, however, is not always the case.
    
    For example, there is a considerable difference between a proposition such as "a father of a father is a grandfather," and a proposition such as "the whole is greater than its parts." The former statement is a tautology; the proposition is contained in the definition of the words; it only thinly conceals the verbal stipulation, "Let us call the parent of a parent a ‘grandparent.' " But that is far from being the case with the second proposition. Let us try to see why.
    
    The statement, "The whole is greater than its parts," expresses our understanding of things as they are and of their relationships, which would be the same no matter what words we used or how we set up our linguistic conventions. Finite quantitative wholes exist and they have definite finite parts; for example, this page can be cut in half or in quarters. Now, as we understand a finite whole (that is, any finite whole) and as we understand a definite part of a finite whole, we understand the whole to be greater than the part, or the part to be less than the whole. So far is this from being a mere verbal matter that we cannot define the meaning of the words "whole" and "part"; these words express primitive or indefinable notions. As we are unable to define them separately, all we can do is express our understanding of whole and part by a statement of how wholes and parts are related.
  - |-
    The statement is axiomatic or self-evident in the sense that  
    its opposite is immediately seen to be false. We can use the word "part" for this page, and the word "whole" for a half of  
    this page after cutting it in two, but we cannot think that the page before it is cut is less than the half of it that we have in  
    our hand after we have cut it. However we use language, our understanding of finite wholes and their definite parts is such  
    that we are compelled to say that we know that the whole is greater than the part, and what we know is the relation be-  
    tween existent wholes and their parts, not something about the use of words or their meanings.
    
    Such self-evident propositions, then, have the status of  
    indemonstrable but also undeniable truths. They are based on  
    common experience alone and are part of common-sense know-  
    ledge, for they belong to no organized body of knowledge; they  
    do not belong to philosophy or mathematics any more than  
    they belong to science or history. That is why, incidentally,  
    Euclid called them "common notions." They are also instruc-  
    tive, despite the fact that Locke, for example, did not think  
    they were. He could see no difference between a proposition  
    that really does not instruct, such as the one about the grand-  
    parent, and one that does—one that teaches us something we  
    would not otherwise know—such as the one about parts and  
    wholes. And those moderns who refer to all such propositions  
    as tautologies make the same mistake. They do not see that  
    some of the propositions they call "tautologies" really add to  
    our knowledge, while others, of course, do not.
    
    Determining an Author's Message 135
    
    Finding the Solutions
    
    These three rules of analytical reading—about terms,  
    propositions, and arguments—can be brought to a head in an  
    eighth rule, which governs the last step in the interpretation  
    of a book's content. More than that, it ties together the first  
    stage of analytical reading (outlining the structure) and the  
    second stage (interpreting the contents).
  - |-
    The last step in your attempt to discover what a book is about was the discovery of the major problems that the author tried to solve in the course of his book. (As you will recall, this was covered by Rule 4.) Now, after you have come to terms with him and grasped his propositions and arguments, you should check what you have found by addressing yourself to some further questions. Which of the problems that the author tried to solve did he succeed in solving? In the course of solving these, did he raise any new ones? Of the problems that he failed to solve, old or new, which did the author himself know he had failed on? A good writer, like a good reader, should know whether a problem has been solved or not, although of course it is likely to cost the reader less pain to acknowledge the situation.
    
    This final step in interpretive reading is covered by
    Rule 8. FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR'S SOLUTIONS ARE. When
    you have applied this rule, and the three that precede it in
    interpretive reading, you can feel reasonably sure that you
    have managed to understand the book. If you started with a
    book that was over your head—one, therefore, that was able to
    teach you something—you have come a long way. More than
    that, you are now able to complete your analytical reading of
    the book. The third and last stage of the job will be relatively
    easy. You have been keeping your eyes and your mind open
    and your mouth shut. Up to this point, you have been follow-
    ing the author. From this point on, you are going to have a
    chance to argue with the author and express yourself.
    
    136 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    The Second Stage of Analytical Reading
  - |-
    We have now described the second stage of analytical reading. Another way to say this is that we have now set forth the materials for answering the second basic question that you must ask about a book, or indeed anything that you read. You will recall that that second question is What is being said in detail, and how? Applying Rules 5 through 8 clearly helps you to answer this question. When you have come to terms with the author, found his key propositions and arguments, and identified his solutions of the problems that he faced, you will know what he is saying in his book, and you are thus prepared to go on to ask the final two basic questions about it.
    
    Since we have now completed another stage in the analytical reading process, let us, as before, pause a moment to write out the rules of this stage for review.
    
    The Second Stage of Analytical Reading,
    or Rules for Finding What a Book Says
    (Interpreting Its Contents)
    
    5. Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key words.
    
    6. Grasp the author's leading propositions by dealing with his most important sentences.
    
    7. Know the author's arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences.
    
    8. Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and as to the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve.
    
    We said at the end of the last chapter that we had come a long way. We have learned how to outline a book. We have learned the four rules for interpreting a book's contents. We are now ready for the last stage of analytical reading. Here you will reap the reward of all your previous efforts.
    
    Reading a book is a kind of conversation. You may think it is not conversation at all, because the author does all the talking and you have nothing to say. If you think that, you do not realize your full obligation as a reader—and you are not grasping your opportunities.
  - |-
    As a matter of fact, the reader is the one who has the last word. The author has had his say, and then it is the reader's turn. The conversation between a book and its reader would appear to be an orderly one, each party talking in turn, no interruptions, and so forth. If, however, the reader is undisciplined and impolite, it may be anything but orderly. The poor author cannot defend himself. He cannot say, "Here, wait till I've finished, before you start disagreeing." He cannot protest that the reader has misunderstood him, has missed his point.
    
    Ordinary conversations between persons who confront each other are good only when they are carried on civilly. We are not thinking merely of the civilities according to conventions of social politeness. Such conventions are not really important. What is important is that there is an intellectual etiquette to be observed. Without it, conversation is bickering rather than profitable communication. We are assuming here, of course, that the conversation is about a serious matter on which men can agree or disagree. Then it becomes important that they conduct themselves well. Otherwise, there is no profit in the enterprise. The profit in good conversation is something learned.
    
    What is true of ordinary conversation is even more true of the rather special situation in which a book has talked to a reader and the reader talks back. That the author is well disciplined, we will take for granted temporarily. That he has conducted his part of the conversation well can be assumed in the case of good books. What can the reader do to reciprocate? What must he do to hold up his end well?
    
    The reader has an obligation as well as an opportunity to talk back. The opportunity is clear. Nothing can stop a reader from pronouncing judgment. The roots of the obligation, however, lie a little deeper in the nature of the relation between books and readers.

    If the book is of the sort that conveys knowledge, the
    author's aim was to instruct. He has tried to teach. He has
    tried to convince or persuade his reader about something. His
    effort is crowned with success only if the reader finally says,
    "I am taught. You have convinced me that such and such is
    true, or persuaded me that it is probable." But even if the
    reader is not convinced or persuaded, the author's intention
    and effort should be respected. The reader owes him a con-
    sidered judgment. If he cannot say, "I agree," he should at
    least have grounds for disagreeing or even for suspending
    judgment on the question.
    
    We are really saying no more than what we have already
    said many times. A good book deserves an active reading. The
    activity of reading does not stop with the work of understand-
    ing what a book says. It must be completed by the work of
    Criticizing a Book Fairly 139
    
    criticism, the work of judging. The undemanding reader
    fails to satisfy this requirement, probably even more than he
    fails to analyze and interpret. He not only makes no effort to
    understand; he also dismisses a book simply by putting it
    aside and forgetting it. Worse than faintly praising it, he
    damns it by giving it no critical consideration whatever.
    
    Teachability as a Virtue
    
    What we mean by talking back is not something apart
    from reading. It is the third stage in the analytical reading of
    a book; and there are rules here as in the case of the first two
    stages. Some of these rules are general maxims of intellectual
    etiquette. We will deal with them in this chapter. Others are
    more specific criteria for defining points of criticism. They will
    be discussed in the next chapter.
  - |-
    There is a tendency to think that a good book is above the criticism of the average reader. The reader and the author are not peers. The author, according to this view, should be subjected to a trial only by a jury of his peers. Remember Bacon's recommendation to the reader: "Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider." Sir Walter Scott casts even more dire aspersions on those "who read to doubt or read to scorn."
    
    There is a certain truth here, of course, but there is also a good deal of nonsense about the aura of impeccability with which books are thus surrounded, and the false piety it produces. Readers may be like children, in the sense that great authors can teach them, but that does not mean they must not be heard from. Cervantes may or may not have been right in saying, "There is no book so bad but something good may be found in it." It is more certain that there is no book so good that no fault can be found with it.
    
    140 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    It is true that a book that can enlighten its readers, and is in this sense superior to them, should not be criticized by them until they understand it. When they do, they have elevated themselves almost to equality with the author. Now they are fit to exercise the rights and privileges of their new position. Unless they exercise their critical faculties now, they are doing the author an injustice. He has done what he could to make them his equal. He deserves that they act like his peers, that they engage in conversation with him, that they talk back.
  - |-
    We are discussing here the virtue of teachability—a virtue  
    that is almost always misunderstood. Teachability is often  
    confused with subservience. A person is wrongly thought to be  
    teachable if he is passive and pliable. On the contrary, teach-  
    ability is an extremely active virtue. No one is really teachable  
    who does not freely exercise his power of independent judg-  
    ment. He can be trained, perhaps, but not taught. The most  
    teachable reader is, therefore, the most critical. He is the  
    reader who finally responds to a book by the greatest effort to  
    make up his own mind on the matters the author has discussed.
    
    We say "finally" because teachability requires that a  
    teacher be fully heard and, more than that, understood before  
    he is judged. We should add also that sheer amount of effort  
    is not an adequate criterion of teachability. The reader must  
    know how to judge a book, just as he must know how to arrive  
    at an understanding of its contents. This third group of rules  
    for reading, then, is a guide to the last stage in the disciplined  
    exercise of teachability.
    
    The Role of Rhetoric
    
    We have everywhere found a certain reciprocity between  
    the art of teaching and the art of being taught, between the  
    skill of the author that makes him a considerate writer and  
    the skill of the reader that makes him handle a book with con-  
    sideration. We have seen how the same principles of grammar  
    and logic underlie rules of good writing as well as rules of  
    good reading. The rules we have so far discussed concern the  
    achievement of intelligibility on the part of the writer and the  
    achievement of understanding on the part of the reader. This  
    last set of rules goes beyond understanding to critical judg-  
    ment. Here is where rhetoric comes in.
  - |-
    There are, of course, many uses of rhetoric. We usually  
    think of it in connection with the orator or the propagandist.  
    But in its most general significance, rhetoric is involved in  
    every situation in which communication takes place among  
    human beings. If we are the talkers, we wish not only to be  
    understood but also to be agreed with in some sense. If our  
    purpose in trying to communicate is serious, we wish to con-  
    vince or persuade—more precisely, to convince about theoret-  
    ical matters and to persuade about matters that ultimately  
    affect action or feeling.
    
    To be equally serious in receiving such communication,  
    one must be not only a responsive but also a responsible  
    listener. You are responsive to the extent that you follow what  
    has been said and note the intention that prompts it. But you  
    also have the responsibility of taking a position. When you  
    take it, it is yours, not the author's. To regard anyone except  
    yourself as responsible for your judgment is to be a slave, not  
    a free man. It is from this fact that the liberal arts acquire their  
    name.
    
    On the part of the speaker or writer, rhetorical skill is  
    knowing how to convince or persuade. Since this is the ultimate  
    end in view, all the other aspects of communication must  
    serve it. Grammatical and logical skill in writing clearly and  
    intelligibly has merit in itself, but it is also a means to an end.  
    Reciprocally, on the part of the reader or listener, rhetorical  
    skill is knowing how to react to anyone who tries to convince  
    or persuade us. Here, too, grammatical and logical skill, which  
    enables us to understand what is being said, prepares the way  
    for a critical reaction.
    
    The Importance of Suspending Judgment
  - |-
    Thus you see how the three arts of grammar, logic, and rhetoric cooperate in regulating the elaborate processes of writing and reading. Skill in the first two stages of analytical reading comes from a mastery of grammar and logic. Skill in the third stage depends on the remaining art. The rules of this stage of reading rest on the principles of rhetoric, conceived in the broadest sense. We will consider them as a code of etique to make the reader not only polite, but also effective, in talking back. (Although it is not generally recognized, etiquette always serves these two purposes, not just the former.)
    
    You probably also see what the ninth rule of reading is going to be. It has been intimated several times already. Do not begin to talk back until you have listened carefully and are sure you understand. Not until you are honestly satisfied that you have accomplished the first two stages of reading should you feel free to express yourself. When you have, you not only have earned the right to turn critic; you also have the duty to do so.
    
    This means, in effect, that the third stage of analytical reading must always follow the other two in time. The first two stages interpenetrate each other. Even the beginning reader can combine them somewhat, and the expert combines them almost completely. He can discover the contents of a book by breaking down the whole into its parts and at the same time constructing the whole out of its elements of thought and knowledge, its terms, propositions, and arguments. Furthermore, even for the beginner, a certain amount of the work required at those two stages can be performed during a good inspectional reading. But the expert no less than the beginner must wait until he understands before he starts to criticize.
    
    Let us restate this ninth rule of reading in the following form: RuLE 9. YoU MUST BE ABLE TO SAY, WITH REASONABLE
  - |-
    CERTAINTY, "I UNDERSTAND," BEFORE YOU CAN SAY ANY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING THINGS: "I AGREE," OR "I DISAGREE, OR "I SUSPEND JUDGMENT. These three remarks exhaust all the critical positions you can take. We hope you have not made the error of supposing that to criticize is always to disagree. That is a popular misconception. To agree is just as much an exercise of critical judgment on your part as to disagree. You can be just as wrong in agreeing as in disagreeing. To agree without understanding is inane. To disagree without understanding is impudent.
    
    Though it may not be so obvious at first, suspending judgment is also an act of criticism. It is taking the position that something has not been shown. You are saying that you are not convinced or persuaded one way or the other.
    
    The rule seems to be such obvious common sense that you may wonder why we have bothered to state it so explicitly. There are two reasons. In the first place, many people make the error already mentioned of identifying criticism with disagreement. (Even "constructive" criticism is disagreement. ) In the second place, though this rule seems obviously sound, our experience has been that few people observe it in practice. Like the golden rule, it elicits more lip service than intelligent obedience.
    
    Every author has had the experience of suffering book reviews by critics who did not feel obliged to do the work of the first two stages first. The critic too often thinks he does not have to be a reader as well as a judge. Every lecturer has also had the experience of having critical questions asked that were not based on any understanding of what he had said. You yourself may remember an occasion where someone said to a speaker, in one breath or at most two, "I don't know what you mean, but I think you're wrong."
    
    There is actually no point in answering critics of this sort. The only polite thing to do is to ask them to state your position for you, the position they claim to be challenging. If they cannot do it satisfactorily, if they cannot repeat what you
  - |-
    We have said in their own words, you know that they do not understand, and you are entirely justified in ignoring their criticisms. They are irrelevant, as all criticism must be that is not based on understanding. When you find the rare person who shows that he understands what you are saying as well as you do, then you can delight in his agreement or be seriously disturbed by his dissent.
    
    In years of reading books with students of one kind and another, we have found this rule more honored in the breach than in the observance. Students who plainly do not know what the author is saying seem to have no hesitation in setting themselves up as his judges. They not only disagree with something they do not understand but, what is equally bad, they also often agree to a position they cannot express intelligibly in their own words. Their discussion, like their reading, is all words. Where understanding is not present, affirmations and denials are equally meaningless and unintelligible. Nor is a position of doubt or detachment any more intelligent in a reader who does not know what he is suspending judgment about.
    
    There are several further points to note concerning the observance of this rule. If you are reading a good book, you ought to hesitate before you say, "I understand." The presumption certainly is that you have a lot of work to do before you can make that declaration honestly and with assurance. You must, of course, be a judge of yourself in this matter, and that makes the responsibility even more severe.
    
    To say "I don't understand" is, of course, also a critical judgment, but only after you have tried your hardest does it reflect on the book rather than yourself. If you have done everything that can be expected of you and still do not understand, it may be because the book is unintelligible. The presumption, however, is in favor of the book, especially if it is a good one. In reading good books, failure to understand is usually the reader's fault. Hence he is obligated to stay with the task imposed by the first two stages of analytical reading
  - |-
    A long time before entering on the third. When you say "I don't understand," watch your tone of voice. Be sure it concedes the possibility that it may not be the author's fault.
    
    There are two other conditions under which the rule requires special care. If you are reading only part of a book, it is more difficult to be sure that you understand, and hence you should be more hesitant to criticize. And sometimes a book is related to other books by the same author, and depends upon them for its full significance. In this situation, also, you should be more circumspect about saying "I understand," and slower to raise your critical lance.
    
    A good example of brashness in this last respect is furnished by literary critics who have agreed or disagreed with Aristotle's Poetics without realizing that the main principles in Aristotle's analysis of poetry depend in part on points made in other of his works, his treatises on psychology and logic and metaphysics. They have agreed or disagreed without understanding what it is all about.
    
    The same is true of other writers, such as Plato and Kant, Adam Smith and Karl Marx, who have not been able to say everything they knew or thought in a single work. Those who judge Kant's Critique of Pure Reason without reading his Critique of Practical Reason, or Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations without reading his Theory of the Moral Sentiments, or The Communist Manifesto without Marx's Capital, are more likely than not to be agreeing or disagreeing with something they do not fully understand.
    
    The Importance of Avoiding Contentiousness
    
    The second general maxim of critical reading is as obvious as the first, but it needs explicit statement, nevertheless, and for the same reason. It is RULE 10, and it can be expressed thus: WHEN YOU DISAGREE, DO SO REASONABLY, AND NOT DISPUTA-TIOUSLY OR CONTENTIOUSLY. There is no point in winning an argument if you know or suspect you are wrong. Practically, of course, it may get you ahead in the world for a short time. But honesty is the better policy in the slightly longer run.
  - |-
    We learned this maxim first from Plato and Aristotle. In a  
    passage in the Symposium, this interchange occurs:
    
    I cannot refute you, Socrates, said Agathon: Let us assume that  
    what you say is true.
    
    Say rather, Agathon, that you cannot refute the truth; for  
    Socrates is easily refuted.
    
    The passage is echoed in a remark of Aristotle's in the Ethics.  
    "It would be thought to be better," he says,
    
    indeed to be our duty, for the sake of maintaining the truth  
    even to destroy what touches us closely, especially as we are philos-
    ophers or lovers of wisdom; for, while both are dear, piety requires  
    us to honor truth above our friends.
    
    Plato and Aristotle here give us advice that most people ignore.  
    Most people think that winning the argument is what matters,  
    not learning the truth.
    
    He who regards conversation as a battle can win only by  
    being an antagonist, only by disagreeing successfully, whether  
    he is right or wrong. The reader who approaches a book in this  
    spirit reads it only to find something he can disagree with. For  
    the disputatious and the contentious, a bone can always be  
    found to pick a quarrel over. It makes no difference whether  
    the bone is really a chip on your own shoulder.
    
    In a conversation that a reader has with a book in the  
    privacy of his own study, there is nothing to prevent the reader  
    from seeming to win the argument. He can dominate the situa-  
    tion. The author is not there to defend himself. If all he wants  
    is the empty satisfaction of seeming to show the author up,  
    the reader can get it readily. He scarcely has to read the book  
    through to get it. Glancing at the first few pages will suffice.
    
    But if he realizes that the only profit in conversation, with
  - |-
    living or dead teachers, is what one can learn from them, if
    he realizes that you win only by gaining knowledge, not by
    knocking the other fellow down, he may see the futility of mere
    contentiousness. We are not saying that a reader should not
    ultimately disagree and try to show where the author is wrong.
    We are saying only that he should be as prepared to agree as
    to disagree. Whichever he does should be motivated by one
    consideration alone—the facts, the truth about the case.
    
    More than honesty is required here. It goes without saying
    that a reader should admit a point when he sees it. But he
    also should not feel whipped by having to agree with an
    author, instead of dissenting. If he feels that way, he is in-
    veterately disputatious. In the light of this second maxim, his
    problem is seen to be emotional rather than intellectual.
    
    On the Resolution of Disagreements
    
    The third maxim is closely related to the second. It states
    another condition prior to the undertaking of criticism. It
    recommends that you regard disagreements as capable of being
    resolved. Where the second maxim urged you not to disagree
    disputatiously, this one warns you against disagreeing hope-
    lessly. One is hopeless about the fruitfulness of discussion if
    he does not recognize that all rational men can agree. Note
    that we said "can agree." We did not say all rational men do
    agree. Even when they do not agree, they can. The point we
    are trying to make is that disagreement is futile agitation unless
    it is undertaken with the hope that it may lead to the resolu-
    tion of an issue.
    
    These two facts, that people do disagree and can agree,
    arise from the complexity of human nature. Men are rational
    animals. Their rationality is the source of their power to agree.
    Their animality, and the imperfections of their reason that it
    entails, is the cause of most of the disagreements that occur.
    Men are creatures of passion and prejudice. The language

    They must use to communicate is an imperfect medium,
    clouded by emotion and colored by interest, as well as inade-
    quately transparent for thought. Yet to the extent that men are
    rational, these obstacles to their understanding can be over-
    come. The sort of disagreement that is only apparent, the sort
    that results from misunderstanding, is certainly curable.
    
    There is, of course, another sort of disagreement, which is
    owing merely to inequalities of knowledge. The relatively ig-
    norant often wrongly disagree with the relatively learned
    about matters exceeding their knowledge. The more learned,
    however, have a right to be critical of errors made by those
    who lack relevant knowledge. Disagreement of this sort can
    also be corrected. Inequality of knowledge is always curable
    by instruction.
    
    There may still be other disagreements that are more
    deeply buried, and that may subsist in the body of reason itself.
    It is hard to be sure about these, and almost impossible for
    reason to describe them. In any event, what we have just said
    applies to the great majority of disagreements. They can be
    resolved by the removal of misunderstanding or of ignorance.
    Both cures are usually possible, though often difficult. Hence
    the person who, at any stage of a conversation, disagrees,
    should at least hope to reach agreement in the end. He should
    be as much prepared to have his own mind changed as seek
    to change the mind of another. He should always keep before
    him the possibility that he misunderstands or that he is ig-
    norant on some point. No one who looks upon disagreement
    as an occasion for teaching another should forget that it is
    also an occasion for being taught.
    
    The trouble is that many people regard disagreement as
    unrelated to either teaching or being taught. They think that
    everything is just a matter of opinion. I have mine, and you
    have yours; and our right to our opinions is as inviolable as
    our right to private property. On such a view, communication
    cannot be profitable if the profit to be gained is an increase in
    knowledge. Conversation is hardly better than a ping-pong

    game of opposed opinions, a game in which no one keeps
    scale, no one wins, and everyone is satisfied because he does
    not lose—that is, he ends up holding the same opinions he
    started with.
    
    We would not—and could not—write this book if we held
    this view. Instead, we hold that knowledge can be communi-
    cated and that discussion can result in learning. If genuine
    knowledge, not mere personal opinion, is at stake, then, for the
    most part, either disagreements are apparent only—to be re-
    moved by coming to terms and a meeting of minds; or they are
    real, and the genuine issues can be resolved—in the long run,
    of course—by appeals to fact and reason. The maxim of ra-
    tionality concerning disagreements is to be patient for the long
    run. We are saying, in short, that disagreements are arguable
    matters. And argument is empty unless it is undertaken on the
    supposition that there is attainable an understanding that,
    when attained by reason in the light of all the relevant evi-
    dence, resolves the original issues.
    
    How does this third maxim apply to the conversation
    between reader and writer? How can it be stated as a rule of
    reading? It deals with the situation in which the reader finds
    himself disagreeing with something in the book. It requires
    him first to be sure that the disagreement is not owing to mis-
    understanding. Suppose that the reader has been careful to
    observe the rule that he must not render a critical judgment
    until he understands, and is therefore satisfied that there is
    no misunderstanding here. What then?
    
    This maxim then requires him to distinguish between
    genuine knowledge and mere opinion, and to regard an issue
    where knowledge is concerned as one that can be resolved. If
    he pursues the matter further, he may be instructed by the
    author on points that will change his mind. If that does not
    happen, he may be justified in his criticism, and, metaphori-
    cally at least, be able to instruct the author. He can at least
    
    hope that were the author alive and present, his mind could
    be changed.
  - |-
    You may remember something that was said on this
    subject in the last chapter. If an author does not give reasons
    for his propositions, they can be treated only as expressions of
    personal opinions on his part. The reader who does not dis-
    tinguish between the reasoned statement of knowledge and
    the flat expression of opinion is not reading to learn. He is at
    most interested in the author's personality and is using the
    book as a case history. Such a reader will, of course, neither
    agree nor disagree. He does not judge the book but the man.
    
    If, however, the reader is primarily interested in the book
    and not the man, he should take his critical obligations seri-
    ously. These involve applying the distinction between real
    knowledge and mere opinion to himself as well as to the
    author. Thus the reader must do more than make judgments
    of agreement or disagreement. He must give reasons for them.
    In the former case, of course, it suffices if he actively shares the
    author's reasons for the point on which they agree. But when
    he disagrees, he must give his own grounds for doing so. Other-
    wise, he is treating a matter of knowledge as if it were opinion.
    
    Therefore, can be stated as follows: RESPECT THE
    DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE AND MERE PERSONAL OPINION,
    BY GIVING REASONS FOR ANY CRITICAL JUDGMENT YOU MAKE.
    
    Incidentally, we would not want to be understood as
    claiming that there is a great deal of "absolute" knowledge
    available to men. Self-evident propositions, in the sense in
    which we defined them in the previous chapter, seem to us to
    be both indemonstrable and undeniable truths. Most knowl-
    edge, however, lacks that degree of absoluteness. What we
    know, we know subject to correction; we know it because all,
    or at least the weight, of the evidence supports it, but we are
    not and cannot be certain that new evidence will not sometime
    invalidate what we now believe is true.
    
    This, however, does not remove the important distinction
    between knowledge and opinion that we have been stressing.
    Knowledge, if you please, consists in those opinions that can
    be defended, opinions for which there is evidence of one kind
  - |-

    or another. If we really know something, in this sense, we
    must believe that we can convince others of what we know.
    Opinion, in the sense in which we have been employing the
    word, is unsupported judgment. That is why we have em-
    ployed the modifiers "mere" or "personal" in conjunction with
    it. We can do no more than opine that something is true when
    we have no evidence or reason for the statement other than
    our personal feeling or prejudice. We can say that it is true
    and that we know it when we have objective evidence that
    other reasonable men are likely to accept.
    
    Let us now summarize the three general maxims we have
    discussed in this chapter. The three together state the condi-
    tions of a critical reading and the manner in which the reader
    should proceed to "talk back" to the author.
    
    The first requires the reader to complete the task of under-
    standing before rushing in. The second adjures him not to be
    disputatious or contentious. The third asks him to view dis-
    agreement about matters of knowledge as being generally
    remediable. This rule goes further: It also commands him to
    give reasons for his disagreements so that issues are not
    merely stated but also defined. In that lies all hope for resolu-
    tion.
    11
    
    AGREEING OR DISAGREEING
    WITH AN AUTHOR
    
    The first thing a reader can say is that he understands or that
    he does not. In fact, he must say he understands, in order to
    say more. If he does not understand, he should keep his peace
    and go back to work on the book.
    
    There is one exception to the harshness of the second
    alternative. "I don't understand" may itself be a critical remark.
    To make it so, the reader must be able to support it. If the
    fault is with the book rather than himself, the reader must
    locate the sources of trouble. He should be able to show that
    the structure of the book is disorderly, that its parts do not
    hang together, that some of it lacks relevance, or, perhaps, that
    the author equivocates in the use of important words, with a
    whole train of consequent confusions. To the extent that a
    reader can support his charge that the book is unintelligible,
    he has no further critical obligations.
  - |-
    Let us suppose, however, that you are reading a good  
    book. That means it is a relatively intelligible one. And let us  
    suppose that you are finally able to say "I understand." If, in  
    addition to understanding the book, you agree thoroughly with  
    what the author says, the work is over. The analytical reading  
    is completely done. You have been enlightened, and convinced  
    or persuaded. It is clear that we have additional steps to con-  
    sider only in the case of disagreement or suspended judgment.  
    The former is the more usual case.
    
    152  
    
    Agreeing or Disagreeing With an Author 153
    
    To the extent that authors argue with their readers—and  
    expect their readers to argue back—the good reader must be  
    acquainted with the principles of argument. He must be able  
    to carry on civil, as well as intelligent, controversy. That is  
    why there is need for a chapter of this sort in a book on read-  
    ing. Not simply by following an author's arguments, but only  
    by meeting them as well, can the reader ultimately reach sig-  
    nificant agreement or disagreement with his author.
    
    The meaning of agreement and disagreement deserves a  
    moment's further consideration. The reader who comes to  
    terms with an author and grasps his propositions and reason-  
    ing shares the author's mind. In fact, the whole process of  
    interpretation is directed toward a meeting of minds through  
    the medium of language. Understanding a book can be de-  
    scribed as a kind of agreement between writer and reader.  
    They agree about the use of language to express ideas. Be-  
    cause of that agreement, the reader is able to see through the  
    author's language to the ideas he is trying to express.
    
    If the reader understands a book, how can he disagree  
    with it? Critical reading demands that he make up his own  
    mind. But his mind and the author's have become as one  
    through his success in understanding the book. What mind has  
    he left to make up independently?
    
    There are some people who make the error that causes  
    this apparent difficulty: they fail to distinguish between two  
    senses of "agreement." In consequence, they wrongly suppose  
    that where there is understanding between men, disagreement  
    is impossible. They say that all disagreement is simply owing  
    to misunderstanding.
  - |-
    The error in this becomes obvious as soon as we remember  
    that the author is making judgments about the world in which  
    we live. He claims to be giving us theoretical knowledge about  
    the way things exist and behave, or practical knowledge about  
    what should be done. Obviously, he can be either right or  
    wrong. His claim is justified only to the extent that he speaks  
    truly, to the extent that he says what is probable in the light  
    of evidence. Otherwise, his claim is unfounded.

    154 HOW TO READ A BOOK  
    
    If you say, for instance, that "all men are equal," we may  
    take you to mean that all men are equally endowed at birth  
    with intelligence, strength, and other abilities. In the light of  
    the facts as we know them, we disagree with you. We think  
    you are wrong. But suppose we have misunderstood you. Sup-  
    pose you meant by these words that all men should have equal  
    political rights. Because we misapprehended your meaning,  
    our disagreement was irrelevant. Now suppose the mistake  
    corrected. Two alternatives still remain. We can agree or dis-  
    agree, but now if we disagree, there is a real issue between us.  
    We understand your political position, but hold a contrary one.  
    
    Issues about matters of fact or policy—issues about the  
    way things are or should be—are real in this sense only when  
    they are based on a common understanding of what is being  
    said. Agreement about the use of words is the indispensable  
    condition for genuine agreement or disagreement about the  
    facts being discussed. It is because of, not in spite of, your  
    meeting the author's mind through a sound interpretation of  
    his book that you are able to make up your own mind as con-  
    curring in or dissenting from the position he has taken.  
    
    Prejudice and Judgment  
    
    Now let us consider the situation in which, having said  
    you understand, you proceed to disagree. If you have tried to  
    abide by the maxims stated in the previous chapter, you dis-  
    agree because you think the author can be shown to be wrong  
    on some point. You are not simply voicing your prejudice or  
    expressing your emotions. Because this is true, then, from an  
    ideal point of view, there are three conditions that must be  
    satisfied if controversy is to be well conducted.
  - |-
    The first is this. Since men are animals as well as rational, it is necessary to acknowledge the emotions you bring to a dispute, or those that arise in the course of it. Otherwise you are likely to be giving vent to feelings, not stating reasons. You may even think you have reasons, when all you have are strong feelings.
    
    Second, you must make your own assumptions explicit. You must know what your prejudices—that is, your prejudg­ments—are. Otherwise you are not likely to admit that your opponent may be equally entitled to different assumptions. Good controversy should not be a quarrel about assumptions. If an author, for example, explicitly asks you to take something for granted, the fact that the opposite can also be taken for granted should not prevent you from honoring his request. If your prejudices lie on the opposite side, and if you do not acknowledge them to be prejudices, you cannot give the author's case a fair hearing.
    
    Third and finally, an attempt at impartiality is a good antidote for the blindness that is almost inevitable in partisanship. Controversy without partisanship is, of course, impossible. But to be sure that there is more light in it, and less heat, each of the disputants should at least try to take the other fellow's point of view. If you have not been able to read a book sympathetically, your disagreement with it is probably more contentious than civil.
    
    These three conditions are, ideally, the sine qua non of intelligent and profitable conversation. They are obviously applicable to reading, insofar as that is a kind of conversation between reader and author. Each of them contains sound advice for readers who are willing to respect the civilities of disagreement.
  - |-
    But the ideal here, as elsewhere, can only be approximated. The ideal should never be expected from human beings.
    We ourselves, we hasten to admit, are sufficiently conscious
    of our own defects. We have violated our own rules about good
    intellectual manners in controversy. We have caught ourselves
    attacking a book rather than criticizing it, knocking straw men
    over, denouncing where we could not support denials, pro-
    claiming our prejudices as if ours were any better than the
    author's.
    
    156 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    We continue to believe, however, that conversation and
    critical reading can be well disciplined. We are therefore go-
    ing to substitute for those three ideal conditions, a set of pre-
    scriptions that may be easier to follow. They indicate the four
    ways in which a book can be adversely criticized. Our hope
    is that if a reader confines himself to making these points, he
    will be less likely to indulge in expressions of emotion or prej-
    udice.
    
    The four points can be briefly summarized by conceiving
    the reader as conversing with the author, as talking back. After
    he has said, "I understand but I disagree," he can make the
    following remarks to the author: (1) "You are uninformed';
    (2) "You are misinformed'; (3) "You are illogical—your rea-
    soning is not cogent'; (4) "Your analysis is incomplete."
    
    These may not be exhaustive, though we think they are.
    In any event, they are certainly the principal points a reader
    who disagrees can make. They are somewhat independent.
    Making one of these remarks does not prevent you from mak-
    ing another. Each and all can be made, because the defects
    they refer to are not mutually exclusive.
    
    But, we should add, the reader cannot make any of these
    remarks without being definite and precise about the respect
    in which the author is uninformed or misinformed or illogical.
    A book cannot be uninformed or misinformed about every-
    thing. It cannot be totally illogical. Furthermore, the reader
    who makes any of these remarks must not only make it defi-
    nitely, by specifying the respect, but he must also support his
    point. He must give reasons for saying what he does.
    
    Judging the Author's Soundness
  - |-
    The first three remarks are somewhat different from the fourth, as we will presently see. Let us consider each of them briefly, and then turn to the fourth.
    
    Agreeing or Disagreeing With an Author 157
    
    1. To say that an author is uninformed is to say that he
    lacks some piece of knowledge that is relevant to the problem
    he is trying to solve. Notice here that unless the knowledge, if
    possessed by the author, would have been relevant, there is no
    point in making this remark. To support the remark, you must
    be able yourself to state the knowledge that the author lacks
    and show how it is relevant, how it makes a difference to his
    conclusions.
    
    A few illustrations here must suffice. Darwin lacked the
    knowledge of genetics that the work of Mendel and later ex-
    perimentalists now provides. His ignorance of the mechanism
    of inheritance is one of the major defects in The Origin of
    Species. Gibbon lacked certain facts that later historical re-
    search has shown to have a bearing on the fall of Rome.
    Usually, in science and history, the lack of information is dis-
    covered by later researches. Improved techniques of observa-
    tion and prolonged investigation make this the way things
    happen for the most part. But in philosophy, it may happen
    otherwise. There is just as likely to be loss as gain with the
    passage of time. The ancients, for example, clearly distin-
    guished between what men can sense and imagine and what
    they can understand. Yet, in the eighteenth century, David
    Hume revealed his ignorance of this distinction between im-
    ages and ideas, even though it had been so well established by
    the work of earlier philosophers.
  - |-
    2. To say that an author is misinformed is to say that he
    asserts what is not the case. His error here may be owing to
    lack of knowledge, but the error is more than that. Whatever
    its cause, it consists in making assertions contrary to fact. The
    author is proposing as true or more probable what is in fact
    false or less probable. He is claiming to have knowledge he
    does not possess. This kind of defect should be pointed out,
    of course, only if it is relevant to the author's conclusions. And
    to support the remark you must be able to argue the truth or
    greater probability of a position contrary to the author's.
    
    158 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    For example, in one of his political treatises, Spinoza ap-
    pears to say that democracy is a more primitive type of govern-
    ment than monarchy. This is contrary to well-ascertained facts
    of political history. Spinoza's error in this respect has a bearing
    on his argument. Aristotle was misinformed about the role that
    the female factor plays in animal reproduction, and conse-
    quently came to unsupportable conclusions about the processes
    of procreation. Aquinas erroneously supposed that the matter
    of the heavenly bodies is essentially different from that of ter-
    restrial bodies, because he supposed that the former change
    only in position, and are otherwise unalterable. Modern astro-
    physics corrects this error and thereby improves on ancient
    and medieval astronomy. But here is an error that has limited
    relevance. Making it does not affect Aquinas' metaphysical
    account of the nature of all sensible things as composed of
    matter and form.
  - |-
    These first two points of criticism may be related. Lack of information, as we have seen, may be the cause of erroneous assertions. Further, whenever a man is misinformed in a certain respect, he is also uninformed in the same respect. But it makes a difference whether the defect is simply negative or positive as well. Lack of relevant knowledge makes it impossible to solve certain problems or support certain conclusions. Erroneous suppositions, however, lead to wrong conclusions and untenable solutions. Taken together, these two points charge an author with defects in his premises. He needs more knowledge than he possesses. His evidences and reasons are not good enough in quantity or quality.
    
    3. To say that an author is illogical is to say that he has committed a fallacy in reasoning. In general, fallacies are of two sorts. There is the non sequitur, which means that what is drawn as a conclusion simply does not follow from the reasons offered. And there is the occurrence of inconsistency, which means that two things the author has tried to say are incompatible. To make either of these criticisms, the reader must be able to show the precise respect in which the author's argument lacks cogency. One is concerned with this defect only to the extent that the major conclusions are affected by it. A book may safely lack cogency in irrelevant respects.
    
    It is more difficult to illustrate this third point, because few really good books make obvious slips in reasoning. When they do occur, they are usually elaborately concealed, and it requires a very penetrating reader to discover them. But we can show you a patent fallacy in Machiavelli's The Prince.
    
    Machiavelli writes:
    
    The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old, are good laws. As there cannot be good laws where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are well armed they have good laws.

    Now it simply does not follow from the fact that good laws depend on an adequate police force, that where the police force is adequate, the laws will necessarily be good. We are ignoring the highly questionable character of the first contention. We are only interested in the non sequitur here. It is truer to say that happiness depends on health than that good laws depend on an effective police force, but it does not follow that all who are healthy are happy.
    
    In his Elements of Law, Hobbes argues in one place that all bodies are nothing but quantities of matter in motion. The world of bodies, he says, has no qualities whatsoever. Then, in another place, he argues that man is himself nothing but a body, or a collection of atomic bodies in motion. Yet, admitting the existence of sensory qualities—colors, odors, tastes, and so forth—he concludes that they are nothing but the motions of atoms in the brain. The conclusion is inconsistent with the position first taken, namely, that the world of bodies in motion is without qualities. What is said of all bodies in motion must apply to any particular group of them, including the atoms of the brain.
    
    This third point of criticism is related to the other two. An author may, of course, fail to draw the conclusions that his evidences or principles imply. Thus his reasoning is incomplete. But we are here concerned primarily with the case in which he reasons poorly from good grounds. It is interesting, but less important, to discover lack of cogency in reasoning from premises that are themselves untrue, or from evidences that are inadequate.
    
    A person who from sound premises reaches a conclusion invalidly is, in a sense, misinformed. But it is worthwhile to distinguish the kind of erroneous statement that is owing to bad reasoning from the kind previously discussed, which is owing to other defects, especially insufficient knowledge of relevant details.
    
    Judging the Author's Completeness
  - |-
    The first three points of criticism, which we have just considered, deal with the soundness of the author's statements and reasoning. Let us turn now to the fourth adverse remark a reader can make. It deals with the completeness of the author's execution of his plan—the adequacy with which he discharges the task he has chosen.
    
    Before we proceed to this fourth remark, one thing should be observed. Since you have said you understand, your failure to support any of these first three remarks obligates you to agree with the author as far as he has gone. You have no freedom of will about this. It is not your sacred privilege to decide whether you are going to agree or disagree.
    
    If you have not been able to show that the author is uninformed, misinformed, or illogical on relevant matters, you simply cannot disagree. You must agree. You cannot say, as so many students and others do, "I find nothing wrong with your premises, and no errors in reasoning, but I don't agree with your conclusions." All you can possibly mean by saying something like that is that you do not like the conclusions. You are not disagreeing. You are expressing your emotions or prejudices. If you have been convinced, you should admit it. (If, despite your failure to support one or more of these three critical points, you still honestly feel unconvinced, perhaps you should not have said you understood in the first place. )
    
    The first three remarks are related to the author's terms, propositions, and arguments. These are the elements he used to solve the problems that initiated his efforts. The fourth remark—that the book is incomplete—bears on the structure of the whole.
  - |-
    4. To say that an author's analysis is incomplete is to say that he has not solved all the problems he started with, or that he has not made as good a use of his materials as possible, that he did not see all their implications and ramifications, or that he has failed to make distinctions that are relevant to his undertaking. It is not enough to say that a book is incomplete. Anyone can say that of any book. Men are finite, and so are their works, every last one. There is no point in making this remark, therefore, unless the reader can define the inadequacy precisely, either by his own efforts as a knower or through the help of other books.
    
    Let us illustrate this point briefly. The analysis of types of government in Aristotle's Politics is incomplete. Because of the limitations of his time and his erroneous acceptance of slavery, Aristotle fails to consider, or for that matter even to conceive, the truly democratic constitution that is based on universal suffrage; nor can he imagine either representative government or the modern kind of federated state. His analysis would have to be extended to apply to these political realities. Euclid's Elements of Geometry is an incomplete account because Euclid failed to consider other postulates about the relation of parallel lines. Modern geometrical works, making these other assumptions, supply the deficiencies. Dewey's How We Think is an incomplete analysis of thinking because it fails to treat the sort of thinking that occurs in reading or learning by instruction in addition to the sort that occurs in investigation and discovery. To a Christian who believes in personal immortality, the writings of Epictetus or Marcus Aurelius are an incomplete account of human happiness.
    
    This fourth point is strictly not a basis for disagreement. It is critically adverse only to the extent that it marks the limitations of the author's achievement. A reader who agrees with a book in part—because he finds no reason to make any of the other points of adverse criticism—may, nevertheless, suspend judgment on the whole, in the light of this fourth point about the book's incompleteness. Suspended judgment on the reader's part responds to an author's failure to solve his problems perfectly.

    Related books in the same field can be critically compared
    by reference to these four criteria. One is better than another
    in proportion as it speaks more truth and makes fewer errors.
    If we are reading for knowledge, that book is best, obviously,
    which most adequately treats a given subject matter. One
    author may lack information that another possesses; one may
    make erroneous suppositions from which another is free; one
    may be less cogent than another in reasoning from similar
    grounds. But the profoundest comparison is made with respect
    to the completeness of the analysis that each presents. The
    measure of such completeness is to be found in the number of
    valid and significant distinctions that the accounts being com-
    pared contain. You may see now how useful it is to have a
    grasp of the author's terms. The number of distinct terms is
    correlative with the number of distinctions.
    
    You may also see how the fourth critical remark ties
    together the three stages of analytical reading of any book.
    The last step of structural outlining is to know the problems
    that the author is trying to solve. The last step of interpreta-
    tion is to know which of these problems the author solved and
    which he did not. The final step of criticism is the point about
    completeness. It touches structural outlining insofar as it con-
    siders how adequately the author has stated his problems, and
    interpretation insofar as it measures how satisfactorily he has
    solved them.
    
    The Third Stage of Analytical Reading
    
    We have now completed, in a general way, the enumeration
    and discussion of the rules of analytical reading. We can
    now set forth all the rules in their proper order and under
    appropriate headings.
    
    I. The First Stage of Analytical Reading:
    Rules for Finding What a Book Is About
    
    1. Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.
    2. State what the whole book is about with the utmost
    brevity.
    
    3. Enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and
    outline these parts as you have outlined the whole.
    Define the problem or problems the author has tried to
    solve.
    
    II. The Second Stage of Analytical Reading:
    Rules for Interpreting a Book's Contents
    
    1. Come to terms with the author by interpreting his key
    words.
    
    2. Grasp the author's leading propositions by dealing with
  - |-
    His most important sentences.
    
    . Know the author's arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences.
    
    . Determine which of his problems the author has solved, and which he has not; and of the latter, decide which the author knew he had failed to solve.

    III. The Third Stage of Analytical Reading:
    Rules for Criticizing a Book as a
    Communication of Knowledge
    
    General Maxims of Intellectual Etiquette
    
    . Do not begin criticism until you have completed your out-
    
    line and your interpretation of the book. (Do not say you
    agree, disagree, or suspend judgment, until you can say
    "T understand." )
    
    Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously.
    Demonstrate that you recognize the difference between
    knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting good
    reasons for any critical judgment you make.
    
    Special Criteria for Points of Criticism
    
    Show wherein the author is uninformed.
    
    Show wherein the author is misinformed.
    
    Show wherein the author is illogical.
    
    Show wherein the author's analysis or account is incom-
    plete.
    
    Note: Of these last four, the first three are criteria for dis-
    agreement. Failing in all of these, you must agree,
    at least in part, although you may suspend judg-
    ment on the whole, in the light of the last point.
    
    We observed at the end of Chapter 7 that applying the
    
    first four rules of analytical reading helps you to answer the
    first basic question you must ask about a book, namely, What
    is the book about as a whole? Similarly, at the end of Chapter 9,
    we pointed out that applying the four rules for interpretation
    helps you to answer the second question you must ask, namely,
    What is being said in detail, and how? It is probably clear that
    the last seven rules of reading—the maxims of intellectual eti-
    quette and the criteria for points of criticism—help you to
    
    Agreeing or Disagreeing With an Author 165
    
    answer the third and fourth basic questions you must ask. You
    will recall that those questions are: Is it true? and What of it?
  - |-
    The question, Is it true? can be asked of anything we  
    read. It is applicable to every kind of writing, in one or another  
    sense of "truth"—mathematical, scientific, philosophical, histori-  
    cal, and poetical. No higher commendation can be given any  
    work of the human mind than to praise it for the measure of  
    truth it has achieved; by the same token, to criticize it ad-  
    versely for its failure in this respect is to treat it with the  
    seriousness that a serious work deserves. Yet, strangely enough,  
    in recent years, for the first time in Western history, there is a  
    dwindling concern with this criterion of excellence. Books win  
    the plaudits of the critics and gain widespread popular atten-  
    tion almost to the extent that they flout the truth—the more  
    outrageously they do so, the better. Many readers, and most  
    particularly those who review current publications, employ  
    other standards for judging, and praising or condemning, the  
    books they read—their novelty, their sensationalism, their se-  
    ductiveness, their force, and even their power to bemuse or  
    befuddle the mind, but not their truth, their clarity, or their  
    power to enlighten. They have, perhaps, been brought to this  
    pass by the fact that so much of current writing outside the  
    sphere of the exact sciences manifests so little concern with  
    truth. One might hazard the guess that if saying something  
    that is true, in any sense of that term, were ever again to be-  
    come the primary concern it should be, fewer books would be  
    written, published, and read.
    
    Unless what you have read is true in some sense, you  
    need go no further. But if it is, you must face the last question.  
    You cannot read for information intelligently without deter-  
    mining what significance is, or should be, attached to the facts  
    presented. Facts seldom come to us without some interpreta-  
    tion, explicit or implied. This is especially true if you are read-  
    ing digests of information that necessarily select the facts  
    according to some evaluation of their significance, some prin-  
    ciple of interpretation. And if you are reading for enlighten-

    ment, there is really no end to the inquiry that, at every stage
    of learning, is renewed by the question, What of it?
    
    These four questions, as we have already pointed out,
    summarize all the obligations of a reader. The first three,
    moreover, correspond to something in the very nature of
    human discourse. If communications were not complex, struc-
    tural outlining would be unnecessary. If language were a
    perfect medium instead of a relatively opaque one, there would
    be no need for interpretation. If error and ignorance did not
    circumscribe truth and knowledge, we should not have to be
    critical. The fourth question turns on the distinction between
    information and understanding, When the material you have
    read is itself primarily informational, you are challenged to go
    further and seek enlightenment. Even when you have been
    somewhat enlightened by what you have read, you are called
    upon to continue the search for significance.
    
    Before proceeding to Part Three, perhaps we should
    stress, once again, that these rules of analytical reading de-
    scribe an ideal performance. Few people have ever read any
    book in this ideal manner, and those who have, probably read
    very few books this way. The ideal remains, however, the
    measure of achievement. You are a good reader to the degree
    in which you approximate it.
    
    When we speak of someone as "well-read," we should
    have this ideal in mind. Too often, we use that phrase to
    mean the quantity rather than the quality of reading. A per-
    son who has read widely but not well deserves to be pitied
    rather than praised. As Thomas Hobbes said, "If I read as
    many books as most men do, I would be as dull-witted as they
    are.
    
    The great writers have always been great readers, but
    that does not mean that they read all the books that, in their
    day, were listed as the indispensable ones. In many cases, they
    read fewer books than are now required in most of our col-
    leges, but what they did read, they read well. Because they
    had mastered these books, they became peers with their
    Agreeing or Disagreeing With an Author 167
  - |-
    Authors. They were entitled to become authorities in their own right. In the natural course of events, a good student frequently becomes a teacher, and so, too, a good reader becomes an author.
    
    Our intention here is not to lead you from reading to writing. It is rather to remind you that one approaches the ideal of good reading by applying the rules we have described in the reading of a single book, and not by trying to become superficially acquainted with a larger number. There are, of course, many books worth reading well. There is a much larger number that should be only inspected. To become well-read, in every sense of the word, one must know how to use whatever skill one possesses with discrimination—by reading every book according to its merits.
    
    12
    AIDS TO READING
    
    Any aid to reading that lies outside the book being read we may speak of as extrinsic. By "intrinsic reading" we mean reading a book in itself, quite apart from all other books. By "extrinsic reading" we mean reading a book in the light of other books. So far we have intentionally avoided mentioning any extrinsic aids to reading. The rules of reading we have set forth are rules of intrinsic reading—they do not include going outside the book to discover what it means. There are good reasons for our having insisted up to now on your primary task as a reader—taking the book into your study and working on it by yourself, with the power of your own mind, and with no other aids. But it would be wrong to continue insisting on this. Extrinsic aids can help. And sometimes they are necessary for full understanding.
    
    One reason why we have said nothing about extrinsic reading up to now is that intrinsic and extrinsic reading tend to fuse in the actual process of understanding and criticizing a book. We really cannot help bringing our experience to bear on the tasks of interpretation and criticism and even outlining. We must have read other books before this one; no one starts his reading career by reading analytically. We may not bring to bear our experience both of other books and of life as systematically as we should, but we nevertheless measure the

    statements and conclusions of a writer against other things that
    we know, from many different sources. Thus it is common
    sense to say that no book should be, because no book can be,
    read entirely and completely in isolation.
    
    But the main reason for avoiding extrinsic aids up to this
    point is that many readers depend on them too slavishly, and
    we wanted you to realize that this is unnecessary. Reading a
    book with a dictionary in the other hand is a bad idea, al-
    though this does not mean you should never go to a dictionary
    for the meanings of words that are strange to you. And seeking
    the meaning of a book that puzzles you in a commentary is
    often ill-advised. On the whole, it is best to do all that you can
    by yourself before seeking outside help; for if you act con-
    sistently on this principle, you will find that you need less and
    less outside help.
    
    The extrinsic aids to reading fall into four categories. In
    the order in which we will discuss them in this chapter, they
    are: first, relevant experiences; second, other books; third,
    commentaries and abstracts; fourth, reference books.
    
    How and when to use any of these types of extrinsic aids
    cannot be stated for every particular case. Some general sug-
    gestions can be made, however. It is a common-sense maxim
    of reading that outside help should be sought whenever a book
    remains unintelligible to you, either in whole or part, after you
    have done your best to read it according to the rules of in-
    trinsic reading.
    
    The Role of Relevant Experience
    
    There are two types of relevant experience that may be
    referred to for help in understanding difficult books. We have
    already mentioned the distinction involved, when we spoke in
    Chapter 6 of the difference between common experience and
    special experience. Common experience is available to all men
  - |-
    and women just because they are alive. Special experience  
    must be actively sought and is available only to those who go  
    to the trouble of acquiring it. The best example of special ex-  
    perience is an experiment in a laboratory, but a laboratory is  
    not always required. An anthropologist may acquire special  
    experience by traveling to the Amazon basin, for example, to  
    study the aboriginal inhabitants of a region that has not yet  
    been explored. He thereby gains experience that is not ordi-  
    narily available to others, and that will never be available to  
    many; for if large numbers of scientists invade the region, it  
    will cease to be unique. Similarly, the experience of the astro-  
    nauts on the moon is highly special, although the moon is not  
    a laboratory in the ordinary sense of the term. Most men do  
    not have the opportunity of knowing what it is like to live on  
    an airless planet, and it will be centuries before this becomes a  
    common experience, if it ever does. Jupiter, too, with its  
    enormously greater gravity, will remain a "laboratory" in this  
    sense for a long time to come, and may always be such.
    
    Common experience does not have to be shared by every-  
    one in order to be common. Common is not the same as uni-  
    versal. The experience of being a child of parents, for example,  
    is not shared by every human being, for some are orphans  
    from birth. However, family life is nevertheless common ex-  
    perience, because most men and women, in the ordinary course  
    of their lives, share it. Nor is sexual love a universal experience,  
    although it is common, in the sense we are giving the word  
    common. Some men and women never experience it, but the  
    experience is shared by such a high proportion of humans that  
    it cannot be called special. (This does not mean that sexual  
    activity cannot be studied in the laboratory, as in fact it has  
    been. ) The experience of being taught is not universal, either,  
    for some men and women never go to school. But it, too, is  
    common.
    
    The two kinds of experience are mainly relevant to differ-  
    ent kinds of books. Common experience is most relevant to the reading of fiction, on the one hand, and to the reading of

     philosophy, on the other. Judgments concerning the verisimilitude of a novel are almost wholly based on common experience; the book, we say, is either true or not true to our experience of life as it is led by most people, ourselves included.
    The philosopher, like the poet, appeals to the common experience of mankind. He does no work in laboratories or research in the field. Hence to understand and test a philosopher's leading principles you do not need the extrinsic aid of special experience. He refers you to your own common sense and your daily observation of the world in which you live.
    
    Special experience is mainly relevant to the reading of scientific works. To understand and judge the inductive arguments in a scientific book, you must be able to follow the evidence that the scientist reports as their basis. Sometimes the scientist's description of an experiment is so vivid and clear that you have no trouble. Sometimes illustrations and diagrams help to acquaint you with the phenomena described.
    
    Both common and special experience are relevant to the reading of history books. This is because history partakes both of the fictional and the scientific. On the one hand, a narrative history is a story, having a plot and characters, episodes, complications of action, a climax, an aftermath. The common experience that is relevant to reading novels and plays is relevant here, too. But history is also like science, in the sense that at least some of the experience on which the historian bases his work is quite special. He may have read a document or many documents that the reader could not manage to see without great trouble. He may have done extensive research, either into the remains of past civilizations or in the form of interviews with living persons in faraway places.
    
    How do you know whether you are making proper use of your experience to help you understand a book? The surest test is one we have already recommended as a test of understanding: ask yourself whether you can give a concrete example of a point that you feel you understand. We have many times asked students to do this, only to find that they could
    172 HOW TO READ A BOOK
  - |-
    Not. The students appeared to have understood the point, but they were completely at a loss when called upon to supply an example. Obviously, they had not really understood the book.
    
    Test yourself in this way when you are not quite sure whether you have grasped a book. Take Aristotle's discussion of virtue in the Ethics, for example. He says over and over that virtue is a mean between the extremes of defect and excess. He gives some concrete examples; can you supply others? If so, you have understood his general point. If not, you should go back and read his discussion again.
    
    Other Books as Extrinsic Aids to Reading
    
    We will have more to say later about syntopical reading, where more than one book is read on a single subject. For the moment, we want to say a few things about the desirability of reading other books as extrinsic aids to the reading of a particular work.
    
    Our advice applies particularly to the reading of so-called great books. The enthusiasm with which people embark on a course of reading great books often gives way, fairly soon, to a feeling of hopeless inadequacy. One reason, of course, is that many readers do not know how to read a single book very well. But that is not all. There is another reason: namely, that they think they should be able to understand the first book they pick up, without having read the others to which it is closely related. They may try to read The Federalist Papers without having first read the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution. Or they may try all these without having read Montesquieu's The Spirit of Laws, Rousseau's The Social Contract, and Locke's second treatise Of Civil Government.
    
    Not only are many of the great books related, but also they were written in a certain order that should not be ignored. A later writer has been influenced by an earlier one. If you read the earlier writer first, he may help you to understand the later one. Reading related books in relation to one another and in an order that renders the later ones more intelligible is a basic common-sense maxim of extrinsic reading.
  - |-
    The utility of this kind of extrinsic reading is simply an
    extension of the value of context in reading a book by itself.
    We have seen how the context must be used to interpret words
    and sentences to find terms and propositions. Just as the whole
    book is the context for any of its parts, so related books pro-
    vide an even larger context that helps you interpret the book
    you are reading.
    
    It has often been observed that the great books are in-
    volved in a prolonged conversation. The great authors were
    great readers, and one way to understand them is to read the
    books they read. As readers, they carried on a conversation
    with other authors, just as each of us carries on a conversation
    with the books we read, though we may not write other books.
    
    To join this conversation, we must read the great books in
    relation to one another, and in an order that somehow respects
    chronology. The conversation of the books takes place in time.
    Time is of the essence here and should not be disregarded. The
    books can be read from the present into the past or from the
    past into the present. Though the order from past to present
    has certain advantages through being more natural, the fact of
    chronology can be observed in either way.
    
    It should be noted, incidentally, that the need to read
    books in relation to one another applies more to history and
    philosophy than to science and fiction. It is most important in
    the case of philosophy, because philosophers are great readers
    of each other. It is probably least important in the case of
    novels or plays, which, if they are really good, can be read in
    isolation, although of course the literary critic will not want
    to confine himself to doing so.
    
    How to Use Commentaries and Abstracts
    
    A third category of extrinsic aids to reading includes com-
    mentaries and abstracts. The thing to emphasize here is that
    such works should be used wisely, which is to say sparingly.
    There are two reasons for this.
  - |-
    The first is that commentators are not always right in their comments on a book. Sometimes, of course, their works are enormously useful, but this is true less often than one could wish. The handbooks and manuals that are widely available in college bookstores and in stores frequented by high school students are often particularly misleading. These works purport to tell the student everything he has to know about a book that has been assigned by one of his teachers, but they are sometimes woefully wrong in their interpretations, and besides, as a practical matter, they irritate some teachers and professors.
    
    In defense of handbooks, it must be conceded that they are often invaluable for passing examinations. Furthermore, to balance the fact that some teachers are irritated by the errors of handbooks, other teachers use them themselves in their teaching.
    
    The second reason for using commentaries sparingly is that, even if they are right, they may not be exhaustive. That is, you may be able to discover important meanings in a book that the author of a commentary about it has not discovered. Reading a commentary, particularly one that seems very self-assured, thus tends to limit your understanding of a book, even if your understanding, as far as it goes, is correct.
    
    Hence, there is one piece of advice that we want to give you about using commentaries. Indeed, this comes close to being a basic maxim of extrinsic reading. Whereas it is one of the rules of intrinsic reading that you should read an author's preface and introduction before reading his book, the rule in the case of extrinsic reading is that you should not read a commentary by someone else until after you have read the book. This applies particularly to scholarly and critical introductions. They are properly used only if you do your best to read the book first, and then and only then apply to them for answers to questions that still puzzle you. If you read them first they are likely to distort your reading of the book. You will tend to see only the points made by the scholar or critic, and fail to see other points that may be just as important.
  - |-
    There is considerable pleasure associated with the reading of such introductions when it is done in this way. You have read the book and understood it. The writer of the introduction has also read it, perhaps many times, and has his own understanding of it. You approach him, therefore, on essentially equal terms. If you read his introduction before reading the book, however, you are at his mercy.
    
    Heeding this rule, that commentaries should be read after you have read the book that they expound and not before, applies also to handbooks. Such works cannot hurt you if you have already read the book and know where the handbook is wrong, if it is. But if you depend wholly on the handbook, and never read the original book, you may be in bad trouble.
    
    And there is this further point. If you get into the habit of depending on commentaries and handbooks, you will be totally lost if you cannot find one. You may be able to understand a particular book with the help of a commentary, but in general you will be a worse reader.
    
    The rule of extrinsic reading given here applies also to abstracts and plot digests. They are useful in two connections, but in those two only. First, they can help to jog your memory of a book's contents, if you have already read it. Ideally, you made such an abstract yourself, in reading the book analytically, but if you have not done so, an abstract or digest can be an important aid. Second, abstracts are useful when you are engaged in syntopical reading, and wish to know whether a certain work is likely to be germane to your project. An abstract can never replace the reading of a book, but it can sometimes tell you whether you want or need to read the book or not.
    
    How to Use Reference Books
    
    There are many kinds of reference books. In the following section we will confine ourselves mainly to the two most used kinds, dictionaries and encyclopedias. However, many of the things we will have to say apply to other kinds of reference books as well.
  - |-
    It is not always realized, yet it is nevertheless true, that  
    a good deal of knowledge is required before you can use a  
    reference book well. Specifically, four kinds of knowledge are  
    required. Thus a reference book is an antidote to ignorance in  
    only a limited way. It cannot cure total ignorance. It cannot  
    do your thinking for you.
    
    To use a reference book well, you must, first, have some  
    idea, however vague it may be, of what you want to know. Your ignorance must be like a circle of darkness surrounded  
    by light. You want to bring light to the dark circle. You can-  
    not do that unless light surrounds the darkness. Another way  
    to say this is that you must be able to ask a reference book an  
    intelligible question. It will be no help to you if you are  
    wandering, lost, in a fog of ignorance.
    
    Second, you must know where to find out what you want  
    to know. You must know what kind of question you are asking,  
    and which kinds of reference books answer that kind of ques-  
    tion. There is no reference book that answers all questions; all  
    such works are specialists, as it were. Practically, this comes  
    down to the fact that you must have a fair overall knowledge  
    of all of the major types of reference books before you can use  
    any one type effectively.
    
    There is a third, and correlative, kind of knowledge that  
    is required before a reference book can be useful to you. You  
    must know how the particular work is organized. It will do

    You no good to know what you want to know, and to know
    the kind of reference book to use, if you do not know how to
    use the particular work. Thus there is an art of reading refer-
    ence books, just as there is an art to reading anything else.
    There is a correlative art to making reference books, by the
    way. The author or compiler should know what kind of in-
    formation readers will seek, and arrange his book to fit their
    needs. He may not always be able to anticipate these, how-
    ever, which is why the rule that you should read the introduc-
    tion and preface to a book before reading the book itself
    applies particularly here. Do not try to use a reference book
    before getting the editor's advice on how to use it.
    
    Of course, not all kinds of questions can be answered by
    reference books. You will not find in any reference book the
    answers to the three questions that God asks the angel in
    Tolstoy's story, What Men Live By—namely, "What dwells in
    man?" "What is not given to man?" and "What do men live
    by?" Nor will you find the answers to another question that is
    also used as the title of a Tolstoy story: "How much land does
    a man need?" And there are many such questions. Reference
    books are only useful when you know which kinds of ques-
    tions can be answered by them, and which cannot. This comes
    down to knowing the sorts of things that men generally agree
    on. Only those things about which men generally and con-
    ventionally agree are to be found in reference books. Un-
    supported opinions have no business there, though they some-
    times creep in.
    
    We agree that it is possible to know when a man was
    born, when he died, and facts about similar matters. We agree
    that it is possible to define words and things, and that it is
    possible to sketch the history of almost anything. We do not
    agree on moral questions or on questions about the future, and
    so these sorts of things are not to be found in reference books.
    We assume in our time that the physical world is orderable,
    and thus almost everything about it is to be found in reference
    books. This was not always so; as a result, the history of refer-

    In essence, books are interesting in themselves, for they can tell us much about changes in men's opinions as to what is knowable.
    
    As you can see, we have just been suggesting that there is a fourth requirement for the intelligent use of reference books. You must know what you want to know; you must know in what reference work to find it; you must know how to find it in the reference work; and you must know that it is considered knowable by the authors or compilers of the book. All this indicates that you must know a good deal before you can use a work of reference. Reference books are useless to people who know nothing. They are not guides to the perplexed.
    
    How to Use a Dictionary
    
    As a reference book, the dictionary is subject to all the considerations outlined above. But the dictionary also invites a playful reading. It challenges anyone to sit down with it in an idle moment. There are worse ways to kill time.
    
    Dictionaries are full of arcane knowledge and witty oddments. Over and above that, of course, they have their more sober employments. To make the most of these, one has to know how to read the special kind of book a dictionary is.
    
    Santayana's remark about the Greeks—that they were the only uneducated people in European history—has a double significance. The masses were, of course, uneducated, but even the learned few—the leisure class—were not educated in the sense that they had to sit at the feet of foreign masters. Education, in that sense, begins with the Romans, who went to school to Greek pedagogues, and became cultivated through contact with the Greek culture they had conquered.
    
    It is not surprising, therefore, that the first dictionaries were glossaries of Homeric words, intended to help Romans read the Iliad and Odyssey as well as other Greek literature employing the "archaic" Homeric vocabulary. In the same way, many of us today need a glossary to read Shakespeare, or if not Shakespeare, Chaucer.

    There were dictionaries in the Middle Ages, but they were
    usually encyclopedias of worldly knowledge comprised of dis-
    cussions of the most important technical terms employed in
    learned discourse. There were foreign-language dictionaries
    in the Renaissance (both Greek and Latin), made necessary
    by the fact that the works that dominated the education of
    the period were in the ancient languages. Even when the so-
    called vulgar tongues—Italian, French, English—gradually re-
    placed Latin as the language of learning, the pursuit of
    learning was still the privilege of the few. Under such circum-
    stances, dictionaries were intended for a limited audience,
    mainly as an aid to reading and writing worthy literature.
    
    Thus we see that from the beginning the educational
    motive dominated the making of dictionaries, although there
    was also an interest in preserving the purity and order of the
    language. As contrasted with the latter purpose, the Oxford
    English Dictionary (known familiarly as the OED), begun in
    1857, was a new departure, in that it did not try to dictate
    usage but instead to present an accurate historical record of
    every type of usage—the worst as well as the best, taken from
    popular as well as elegant writing. But this conflict between
    the lexicographer as self-appointed arbiter and the lexicog-
    rapher as historian can be regarded as a side-issue, for the
    dictionary, however constructed, is primarily an educational
    instrument.
    
    This fact is relevant to the rules for using a dictionary
    well, as an extrinsic aid to reading. The first rule of reading
    any book is to know what kind of book it is. That means know-
    ing what the author's intention was and what sort of thing you
    can expect to find in his work. If you look upon a dictionary
    merely as a spelling book or guide to pronunciation, you will
    use it accordingly, which is to say not well. If you realize that
    it contains a wealth of historical information, crystallized in
    the growth and development of language, you will pay atten-
    tion, not merely to the variety of meanings listed under each
    word, but also to their order and relation.
  - |-
    Above all, if you are interested in advancing your own
    education, you will use a dictionary according to its primary
    intention—as a help in reading books that might otherwise be
    too difficult because their vocabulary includes technical words,
    archaic words, literary allusions, or even familiar words used
    in obsolete senses.
    
    Of course, there are many problems to be solved in read-
    ing a book well other than those arising from an author's
    vocabulary. And we have warned against—particularly on the
    first reading of a difficult book—sitting with the book in one
    hand and the dictionary in the other. If you have to look up
    too many words at the beginning, you will certainly lose track
    of the book's unity and order. The dictionary's primary service
    is on those occasions when you are confronted with a techni-
    cal word or with a word that is wholly new to you. Even then,
    we would not recommend looking up even these during your
    first reading of a good book unless they seem to be important
    to the author's general meaning.
    
    This suggests several other negative injunctions. There is
    no more irritating fellow than the one who tries to settle an
    argument about communism, or justice, or freedom, by quoting
    from the dictionary. Lexicographers may be respected as
    authorities on word usage, but they are not the ultimate
    founts of wisdom. Another negative rule is: Don't swallow the
    dictionary. Don't try to get word-rich quick by memorizing a
    fancy list of words whose meanings are unconnected with any
    actual experience. In short, do not forget that the dictionary is
    a book about words, not about things.
    
    If we remember this, we can derive from that fact all the
    rules for using a dictionary intelligently. Words can be looked
    at in four ways.
    
    1. WORDS ARE PHYSICAL THINGS—writable words and speak-
    able sounds. There must, therefore, be uniform ways of spell-
    ing and pronouncing them, though the uniformity is often
    spoiled by variations, and in any event is not as eternally
    important as some of your teachers may have indicated.
  - |-
    2. Words are parts of speech. Each single word plays a grammatical role in the more complicated structure of a phrase or sentence. The same word can vary in different usages, shifting from one part of speech to another, especially in a non-inflected language like English.
    
    3. Words are signs. They have meanings, not one but many. These meanings are related in various ways. Sometimes they shade from one into another; sometimes a word will have two or more sets of totally unrelated meanings. Through their meanings, different words are related to one another—as synonyms sharing in the same meaning even though they differ in shading; or as antonyms through opposition or contrast of meanings. Furthermore, it is in their capacity as signs that we distinguish words as proper or common names (according as they name just one thing or many that are alike in some respect); and as concrete or abstract names (according as they point to something we can sense, or refer to some aspect of things that we can understand by thought but not observe through our senses).
    
    Finally, 4. Words are conventional. They are man-made signs. That is why every word has a history, a cultural career in the course of which it goes through certain transformations. The history of words is given by their etymological derivation from original word-roots, prefixes, and suffixes; it includes the account of their physical changes, both in spelling and pronunciation; it tells of the shifting meanings, and which among them are archaic and obsolete, which are current and regular, which are idiomatic, colloquial, or slang.
    
    A good dictionary will answer all of these four different kinds of questions about words. The art of using a dictionary consists in knowing what questions to ask about words and how to find the answers. We have suggested the questions. The dictionary itself tells you how to find the answers.
  - |-
    As such, it is a perfect self-help book, because it tells you what to pay attention to and how to interpret the various abbreviations and symbols it uses in giving you the four varieties of information about words. Anyone who fails to consult the explanatory notes and the list of abbreviations at the beginning of a dictionary has only himself to blame if he is not able to use it well.
    
    How to Use an Encyclopedia
    
    Many of the things we have said about dictionaries apply to encyclopedias also. Like the dictionary, the encyclopedia invites a playful reading. It too is diverting, entertaining, and, for some people, soothing. But it is just as vain to try to read an encyclopedia through as a dictionary. The man who knew an encyclopedia by heart would be in grave danger of incurring the title idiot savant—"learned fool."
    
    Many people use a dictionary to find out how to spell and pronounce words. The analogous employment of an encyclopedia is to use it only to look up dates and places and other such simple facts. But this is to under-use, or misuse, an encyclopedia. Like dictionaries, such works are educational as well as informational tools. A glance at their history will confirm this.
    
    Though the word "encyclopedia" is Greek, the Greeks had no encyclopedia, and for the same reason that they had no dictionary. The word meant to them not a book about knowledge, a book in which knowledge reposed, but knowledge itself—all the knowledge that an educated man should have. It was again the Romans who first found encyclopedias necessary; the oldest extant example is that of Pliny.
    
    Interestingly enough, the first alphabetically-arranged encyclopedia did not appear until about 1700. Most of the great encyclopedias since then have been alphabetical. It is the easiest of all arrangements, and it made possible great strides in encyclopedia-making.

    Encyclopedias present a different problem from word-books. An alphabetical arrangement is natural for a dictionary.
    But is the world, which is the subject matter of an encyclopedia, arranged alphabetically? Obviously not. Well then, how
    is the world arranged and ordered? This comes down to asking how knowledge is ordered.
    
    The ordering of knowledge has changed with the centuries. All knowledge was once ordered in relation to the
    seven liberal arts—grammar, rhetoric, and logic, the trivium;
    arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music, the quadrivium.
    Medieval encyclopedias reflected this arrangement. Since the
    universities were arranged according to the same system, and
    students studied according to it also, the arrangement was
    useful in education.
    
    The modern university is very different from the medieval
    one, and the change is reflected in modern encyclopedias. The
    knowledge that they report is divided up in fiefs, or specialties,
    that are roughly equivalent to the various departments of the
    university. But this arrangement, although it forms the back-
    bone structure of an encyclopedia, is masked by the alphabetical
    arrangement of the material.
    
    It is this infra-structure—to take a term from the sociologists
    —that the good reader and user of an encyclopedia will seek
    to discover. It is true that it is primarily factual information
    that he wants from his set. But he should not be content with
    facts in isolation. The encyclopedia presents him with an ar-
    rangement of facts—facts in relation to other facts. The under-
    standing, as contrasted with the mere information, that an
    encyclopedia can provide depends on the recognition of such
    relations.
    
    In an alphabetically-arranged encyclopedia, these relations
    are to a large extent obscured. In a topically-arranged encyclo-
    pedia,

    pedia, they are, of course, highlighted. But topical encyclopedias have many disadvantages, among them the fact that most readers are not accustomed to using them. Ideally, the best encyclopedia would be one that had both a topical and an alphabetical arrangement. Its presentation of material in the form of separate articles would be alphabetical, but it would also contain some kind of topical key or outline—essentially, a table of contents. (A table of contents is a topical arrangement of a book, as opposed to an index, which is an alphabetical arrangement.) As far as we know, there is no such encyclopedia on the market today, but it would be worth the effort to try to make one.
    
    In default of the ideal, the reader must fall back on the help and advice provided him by an encyclopedia's editors. Any good encyclopedia includes directions about how to use it effectively, and these should be read and followed. Often, these directions require that the user go first to the set's index, before turning to one of the alphabetically-arranged volumes. Here, the index is serving the function of a table of contents, though not very well; for it gathers together, under one heading, references to discussions in the encyclopedia that may be widely separated in space but that are nevertheless about the same general subject. This reflects the fact that although an index is of course alphabetically arranged, its so-called analytics—that is, the breakdowns under a main entry—are topically arranged. But the topics themselves must be in alphabetical order, which is not necessarily the best arrangement. Thus the index of a really good encyclopedia such as Britannica goes part of the way toward revealing the arrangement of knowledge that the work reflects. For this reason, any reader who fails to use the index has only himself to blame if the work does not serve his needs.
    
    There are negative injunctions associated with the use of encyclopedias, just as there are for dictionaries. Encyclopedias, like dictionaries, are valuable adjuncts to the reading of good books—bad books do not ordinarily require their presence; but,
  - |-
    As before, it is wise not to enslave yourself to an encyclopedia.
    Again, as with dictionaries, encyclopedias are not to be used
    for the settling of arguments where these are based on differ-
    ences of opinion. Nevertheless, they should be used to end
    disputes about matters of fact as quickly and permanently as
    possible. Facts should never be argued about in the first place.
    An encyclopedia makes this vain effort unnecessary, because
    encyclopedias are full of facts. Ideally, they are filled with
    nothing else. Finally, although dictionaries usually agree in
    their accounts of words, encyclopedias often do not agree in
    their accounts of facts. Hence, if you are really interested in a
    subject and are depending on encyclopedic treatments of it,
    do not restrict yourself to just one encyclopedia. Read more
    than one, and preferably ones written at different times.
    
    We noted several points about words that the user should
    keep in mind when he consults a dictionary. In the case of
    encyclopedias, the analogous points are about facts, for an
    encyclopedia is about facts as a dictionary is about words.
    
    1. Facts ARE PROPOSITIONS. Statements of fact employ
    words in combination, such as "Abraham Lincoln was born on
    February 12, 1809," or "the atomic number of gold is 79."
    Facts are not physical things, as words are, but they do require
    to be explained. For thorough knowledge, for understanding,
    you must also know what the significance of a fact is—how it
    affects the truth you are seeking. You do not know much if all
    you know is what the fact is.
    
    2. FACTs ARE "TRUE" PROPOSITIONS. Facts are not opinions.
    When someone says "it is a fact that," he means that it is gen-
    erally agreed that such is the case. He never means, or never
    should mean, that he alone, or he together with a minority of
    observers, believes such and such to be the case. It is this
    characteristic of facts that gives the encyclopedia its tone and
    style. An encyclopedia that contains the unsupported opinions
    of its editors is dishonest; and although an encyclopedia may
  - |-
    report opinions (for example, in a phrase like "it is held by some that this is the case, by others that that is the case"), it must clearly label them. The requirement that an encyclopedia report the facts of the case and not opinions about it (except as noted above) also limits the work's coverage. It cannot properly deal with matters about which there is no consensus—with moral questions, for example. If it does deal with such questions, it can only properly report the disagreements among men about them.
    
    3. FACTS ARE REFLECTIONS OF REALITY. Facts may be either
    (a) informational singulars or (b) relatively unquestioned generalizations, but in either case they are held to represent the way things really are. (The birthdate of Lincoln is an informational singular; the atomic number of gold implies a relatively unquestioned generalization about matter.) Thus facts are not ideas or concepts, nor are they theories in the sense of being mere speculations about reality. Similarly, an explanation of reality (or of part of it) is not a fact until and unless there is general agreement that it is correct.
    
    There is one exception to the last statement. An encyclopedia can properly describe a theory that is no longer held to be correct, in whole or in part, or one that has not yet been fully validated, when it is associated with a topic, person or school that is the subject of an article. Thus, for example, Aristotle's views on the nature of celestial matter could be expounded in an article on Aristotelianism even though we no longer believe them to be true.
    
    Finally, 4. FACTS ARE TO SOME EXTENT CONVENTIONAL.
    Facts change, we say. We mean that some propositions that are considered to be facts in one epoch are no longer considered to be facts in another. Insofar as facts are "true" and represent reality, they cannot change, of course, because truth, strictly speaking, does not change, nor does reality. But not all propositions that we take to be true are really true; and we
  - |-
    We must concede that almost any given proposition that we take to be true can be falsified by more patient or more accurate observation and investigation. This applies particularly to the facts of science.
    
    Facts are also—again to some extent—culturally determined. An atomic scientist, for example, maintains a complicated, hypothetical structure of reality in his mind that determines—for him—certain facts that are different from the facts that are determined for and accepted by a primitive. This does not mean that the scientist and the primitive cannot agree on any facts; they must agree, for instance, that two plus two is four, or that a physical whole is greater than any of its parts. But the primitive may not agree with the scientist's facts about nuclear particles, just as the scientist may not agree with the primitive's facts about ritual magic (That was a hard sentence to write, because, being culturally determined ourselves, we tend to agree with the scientist rather than the primitive and were thus tempted to put the second "fact" in quotation marks. But that is precisely the point. )
    
    A good encyclopedia will answer your questions about facts if you remember the points about facts that we have outlined above. The art of using an encyclopedia as an aid to reading is the art of asking the proper questions about facts. As with the dictionary, we have merely suggested the questions; the encyclopedia will supply the answers.
    
    You should also remember that an encyclopedia is not the best place to pursue understanding. Insights may be gained from it about the order and arrangement of knowledge; but that, although an important subject, is nonetheless a limited one. There are many matters required for understanding that you will not find in an encyclopedia.
    
    There are two particularly striking omissions. An encyclopedia, properly speaking, contains no arguments, except insofar as it reports the course of arguments that are now widely accepted as correct or at least as of historical interest. Thus a
  - |-
    The major element in expository writing is lacking. An encyclopedia  
    also contains no poetry or imaginative literature, although it  
    may contain facts about poetry and poets. Since both the im-  
    agination and the reason are required for understanding, this  
    means that the encyclopedia must be a relatively unsatisfying  
    tool in the pursuit of it.

    HOW TO READ  
    PRACTICAL BOOKS  
    
    In any art or field of practice, rules have a disappointing way  
    of being too general. The more general, of course, the fewer,  
    and that is an advantage. The more general, too, the more  
    intelligible—it is easier to understand the rules in and by them-  
    selves, But it is also true that the more general the rules, the  
    more remote they are from the intricacies of the actual situa-  
    tion in which you try to follow them.  
    
    We have stated the rules of analytical reading generally so  
    that they apply to any expository book—any book that conveys  
    knowledge, in the sense in which we have been using that  
    term. But you cannot read a book in general. You read this  
    book or that, and every particular book is of a particular sort.  
    It may be a history or a book in mathematics, a political tract  
    or a work in natural science, or a philosophical or theological  
    treatise. Hence, you must have some flexibility and adapt-  
    ability in following the rules. Fortunately, you will gradually  
    get the feeling of how they work on different kinds of books as  
    you apply them.  
    
    It is important to note here that the fifteen rules of read-  
    ing, in the form in which they were presented toward the end  
    of Chapter 11, do not apply to the reading of fiction and poetry.  
    The outlining of the structure of an imaginative work is a dif-  
    ferent matter from the outlining of an expository book. Novels

    192 HOW TO READ A BOOK

    and plays and poems do not proceed by terms, propositions,
    and arguments—their fundamental content, in other words, is
    not logical, and the criticism of such works is based on different
    premises. Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to think that no
    rules at all apply to reading imaginative literature. In fact,
    there is a parallel set of rules for reading such books that we
    will describe in the next chapter. These are useful in them-
    selves; but the examination of them and their differences from
    the rules for reading expository works also throws light on the
    latter rules.
    
    You need not fear that you will have to learn a whole new
    set of fifteen or more rules for reading fiction and poetry. The
    connection between the two kinds of rules is easy to see and
    state. It consists in the underlying fact, which we have empha-
    sized over and over, that you must ask questions when you
    read, and specifically that you must ask four particular ques-
    tions of whatever you are reading. These four questions are
    relevant to any book, whether fiction or nonfiction, whether
    poetry or history or science or philosophy. We have seen how
    the rules of reading expository works connect with and are
    developed from these four questions. Similarly, the rules of
    reading imaginative literature are also developed from them,
    although the difference in the nature of the materials read
    causes some dissimilarities in the development.
    
    That being the case, in this part of the book we will have
    more to say about these questions than about the rules for
    reading. We will occasionally refer to a new rule, or to a revi-
    sion or adaptation of an old one. But most of the time, as we
    proceed to suggest approaches to the reading of different kinds
    of books and other materials, we will emphasize the different
    questions that must be primarily asked, and the different kinds
    of answers that can be expected.
    
    In the expository realm, we have noted that the basic divi-
    sion is into the practical and the theoretical—books that are
    concerned with the problems of action, and books that are
    concerned only with something to be known. The theoretical is

    further divisible, as we have noted, into history, science (and
    mathematics), and philosophy. The practical division cuts
    across all boundaries, and we therefore propose to examine the
    nature of such books a little further, and to suggest some guide-
    lines and precautions when you read them.
    
    The Two Kinds of Practical Books
    
    The most important thing to remember about any practical
    book is that it can never solve the practical problems with
    which it is concerned. A theoretical book can solve its own
    problems. But a practical problem can only be solved by action
    itself. When your practical problem is how to earn a living, a
    book on how to make friends and influence people cannot solve
    it, though it may suggest things to do. Nothing short of the
    doing solves the problem. It is solved only by earning a living.
    
    Take this book, for example. It is a practical book. If your
    interest in it is practical (it might, of course, be only theoreti-
    cal), you want to solve the problem of learning to read. You
    would not regard that problem as solved and done away with
    until you did learn. This book cannot solve the problem for
    you. It can only help. You must actually go through the activity
    of reading, not only this book but many others. That is what it
    means to say that nothing but action solves practical problems,
    and action occurs only in the world, not in books.
    
    Every action takes place in a particular situation, always
    in the here and now and under a particular set of circum-
    stances. You cannot act in general. The kind of practical judg-
    ment that immediately precedes action must be highly particu-
    lar. It can be expressed in words, but it seldom is. It is almost
    never found in books, because the author of a practical book
    cannot envisage the concrete practical situations in which his
    readers may have to act. Try as he will to be helpful, he
    cannot give them concrete practical advice. Only another per-
    son in exactly the same situation could do that.
  - |-
    Practical books can, however, state more or less general  
    rules that apply to a lot of particular situations of the same  
    sort. Whoever tries to use such books must apply the rules to  
    particular cases and, therefore, must exercise practical judg-  
    ment in doing so. In other words, the reader himself must add  
    something to the book to make it applicable in practice. He  
    must add his knowledge of the particular situation and his  
    judgment of how the rule applies to the case.
    
    Any book that contains rules—prescriptions, maxims, or  
    any sort of general directions—you will readily recognize as a  
    practical book. But a practical book may contain more than  
    rules. It may try to state the principles that underlie the rules  
    and make them intelligible. For example, in this practical book  
    about reading, we have tried here and there to explain the  
    rules by brief expositions of grammatical, rhetorical, and logi-  
    cal principles. The principles that underlie rules are usually  
    in themselves scientific, that is, they are items of theoretical  
    knowledge. Taken together, they are the theory of the thing.  
    Thus, we talk about the theory of bridge building or the theory  
    of contract bridge. We mean the theoretical principles that  
    make the rules of good procedure what they are.
    
    Practical books thus fall into two main groups. Some, like  
    this one, or a cookbook, or a driver's manual, are primarily  
    presentations of rules. Whatever other discussion they contain  
    is for the sake of the rules. There are few great books of this  
    sort. The other kind of practical book is primarily concerned  
    with the principles that generate rules. Most of the great books  
    in economics, politics, and morals are of this sort.
    
    This distinction is not sharp and absolute. Both principles  
    and rules may be found in the same book. The point is one of  
    relative emphasis. You will have no difficulty in sorting books  
    into these two piles. The book of rules in any field will always  
    be immediately recognizable as practical. The book of prac-  
    tical principles may look at first like a theoretical book. In a  
    sense it is, as we have seen. It deals with the theory of a  
    particular kind of practice. You can always tell it is practical,
  - |-
    However. The nature of its problems gives it away. It is always  
    about a field of human behavior in which men can do better or  
    worse.
    
    In reading a book that is primarily a rule-book, the major  
    propositions to look for, of course, are the rules. A rule is most  
    directly expressed by an imperative rather than a declarative  
    sentence. It is a command. It says: "Save nine stitches by taking  
    a stitch in time." That rule can also be expressed declaratively,  
    as when we say, "A stitch in time saves nine." Both forms of  
    statement suggest—the imperative a little more emphatically,  
    but not necessarily more memorably—that it is worth while to  
    be prompt.
    
    Whether it is stated declaratively or in the form of a com-  
    mand, you can always recognize a rule because it recommends  
    something as worth doing to gain a certain end. Thus, the rule  
    of reading that commands you to come to terms can also be  
    stated as a recommendation: good reading involves coming to  
    terms. The word "good" is the giveaway. That such reading is  
    worth doing is implied.
    
    The arguments in a practical book of this sort will be at-  
    tempts to show you that the rules are sound. The writer may  
    have to appeal to principles to persuade you that they are, or  
    he may simply illustrate their soundness by showing you how  
    they work in concrete cases. Look for both sorts of arguments.  
    The appeal to principles is usually less persuasive, but it has  
    one advantage. It can explain the reason for the rules better  
    than examples of their use.
    
    In the other kind of practical books, the kind dealing  
    mainly with the principles underlying rules, the major propo-  
    sitions and arguments will, of course, look exactly like those in  
    a purely theoretical book. The propositions will say that some-  
    thing is the case, and the arguments will try to show that it is  
    so.
    
    But there is an important difference between reading such  
    a book and reading a purely theoretical one. Since the ultimate  
    problems to be solved are practical—problems of action, in
  - |-

     fields where men can do better or worse—an intelligent reader
    of such books about "practical principles" always reads be-
    tween the lines or in the margins. He tries to see the rules that
    may not be expressed but that can, nevertheless, be derived
    from the principles. He goes further. He tries to figure out
    how the rules should be applied in practice.
    
    Unless it is so read, a practical book is not read as practi-
    cal. To fail to read a practical book as practical is to read it
    poorly. You really do not understand it, and you certainly can-
    not criticize it properly in any other way. If the intelligibility
    of rules is to be found in principles, it is no less true that the
    significance of practical principles is to be found in the rules
    they lead to, the actions they recommend.
    
    This indicates what you must do to understand either sort
    of practical book. It also indicates the ultimate criteria for
    critical judgment. In the case of purely theoretical books, the
    criteria for agreement or disagreement relate to the truth of
    what is being said. But practical truth is different from theo-
    retical truth. A rule of conduct is practically true on two condi-
    tions: one is that it works; the other is that its working leads
    you to the right end, an end you rightly desire.
    
    Suppose that the end an author thinks you should seek
    does not seem like the right one to you. Even though his recom-
    mendations may be practically sound, in the sense of getting
    you to that end, you will not agree with him ultimately. And
    your judgment of his book as practically true or practically
    false will be made accordingly. If you do not think careful and
    intelligent reading is worth doing, this book has little practical
    truth for you, however sound its rules may be.
    
    Notice what this means. In judging a theoretical book, the
    reader must observe the identity of, or the discrepancy be-
    tween, his own basic principles or assumptions and those of the
    author. In judging a practical book, everything turns on the
    ends or goals. If you do not share Karl Marx's fervor about
    economic justice, his economic doctrine and the reforms it
    suggests are likely to seem to you practically false or irrelevant.

    You may think, as Edmund Burke did, for example, that preserving the status quo is the most desirable objective; everything considered, you believe that to be more important than removing the inequities of capitalism. In that case, you are likely to think that a book like The Communist Manifesto is preposterously false. Your main judgment will always be in terms of the ends, not the means. We have no practical interest in even the soundest means to reach ends we disapprove of or do not care about.
    
    The Role of Persuasion
    
    This brief discussion gives you a clue to the two major questions you must ask yourself in reading any sort of practical book. The first is: What are the author's objectives? The second is: What means for achieving them is he proposing? It may be more difficult to answer these questions in the case of a book about principles than in the case of one about rules. The ends and means are likely to be less obvious. Yet answering them in either case is necessary for the understanding and criticism of a practical book.
    
    It also reminds you of one aspect of practical writing that we noted earlier. There is an admixture of oratory or propaganda in every practical book. We have never read a book of political philosophy—however theoretical it may have appeared, however "abstract" the principles with which it dealt—that did not try to persuade the reader about "the best form of government." Similarly, moral treatises try to persuade the reader about "the good life" as well as recommend ways of leading it. And we have tried continuously to persuade you to read books in a certain way, for the sake of the understanding that you may attain.
    
    You can see why the practical author must always be something of an orator or propagandist. Since your ultimate judgment of his work is going to turn on your acceptance of the goal for which he is proposing means, it is up to him to win you to his ends. To do this, he has to argue in a way that appeals to your heart as well as your mind. He may have to play on your emotions and gain direction of your will.
  - |-
    There is nothing wrong or vicious about this. It is of the  
    very nature of practical affairs that men have to be persuaded  
    to think and act in a certain way. Neither practical thinking  
    nor action is an affair of the mind alone. The emotions can-  
    not be left out. No one makes serious practical judgments or  
    engages in action without being moved somehow from below  
    the neck. The world might be a better place if we did, but it  
    would certainly be a different world. The writer of practical  
    books who does not realize this will be ineffective. The reader  
    of them who does not is likely to be sold a bill of goods with-  
    out his knowing it.
    
    The best protection against propaganda of any sort is the  
    recognition of it for what it is. Only hidden and undetected  
    oratory is really insidious. What reaches the heart without  
    going through the mind is likely to bounce back and put the  
    mind out of business. Propaganda taken in that way is like a  
    drug you do not know you are swallowing. The effect is mys-  
    terious; you do not know afterwards why you feel or think the  
    way you do.
    
    The person who reads a practical book intelligently, who  
    knows its basic terms, propositions, and arguments, will always  
    be able to detect its oratory. He will spot the passages that  
    make an "emotive use of words." Aware that he must be sub-  
    ject to persuasion, he can do something about weighing the  
    appeals. He has sales resistance; but this need not be one  
    hundred percent. Sales resistance is good when it prevents  
    you from buying hastily and thoughtlessly. But the reader who  
    supposes he should be totally deaf to all appeals might just as  
    well not read practical books.
    
    There is a further point here. Because of the nature of  
    practical problems and because of the admixture of oratory in  
    all practical writing, the "personality" of the author is more

    Important in the case of practical books than theoretical. You  
    need know nothing whatever about the author of a mathematical treatise; his reasoning is either good or not, and it makes no  
    difference what kind of man he is. But in order to understand and judge a moral treatise, a political tract, or an economic  
    discussion, you should know something about the character of the writer, something about his life and times. In reading  
    Aristotle's Politics, for example, it is highly relevant to know that Greek society was based on slavery. Similarly, much light  
    is thrown on The Prince by knowing the Italian political situation at the time of Machiavelli, and his relation to the Medicis; or, in the case of Hobbes' Leviathan, that Hobbes lived during  
    the English civil wars and was almost pathologically distressed by social violence and disorder.
    
    What Does Agreement Entail  
    in the Case of a Practical Book?
    
    We are sure that you can see that the four questions you  
    must ask about any book are somewhat changed in the case  
    of reading a practical book. Let us try to spell out these  
    changes.
    
    The first question, What is the book about?, does not  
    change very much. Since a practical book is an expository one,  
    it is still necessary, in the course of answering this first ques-  
    tion, to make an outline of the book's structure.
    
    However, although you must always try to find out (Rule  
    4 covers this) what an author's problems were, here, in the  
    case of practical books, this requirement becomes the domi-  
    nant one. We have said that you must try to discern the  
    author's objectives. That is another way of saying you must  
    know what problems he was trying to solve. You must know  
    what he wanted to do—because, in the case of a practical  
    work, knowing what he wants to do comes down to knowing
  - |-
    The second question does not change very much, either.
    You must still, in order to answer the question about the book's
    meaning or contents, discover the author's terms, propositions,
    and arguments. But here again it is the last aspect of that task
    (covered by Rule 8) that now looms most important. Rule 8,
    you will recall, required you to say which of the author's prob-
    lems he solved and which he did not. The adaptation of this
    rule that applies in the case of practical books has already
    been stated. You must discover and understand the means the
    author recommends for achieving what he is proposing. In
    other words, if Rule 4 as adapted for practical books is
    FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR WANTS YOU TO DO, then Rule 8, as
    similarly adapted, is FIV> OUR HOW HE PROPOSES THAT YOU DO
    THIS.
    
    The third question, Is it true?, is changed somewhat more
    than the first two. In the case of a theoretical book, the ques-
    tion is answered when you have compared the author's descrip-
    tion and explanation of what is or happens in the world with
    your own knowledge thereof. If the book accords generally
    with your own experience of the way things are, then you
    must concede its truthfulness, at least in part. In the case of a
    practical book, although there is some such comparison of the
    book and reality, the main consideration is whether the au-
    thor's objectives—that is, the ends that he seeks, together with
    the means he proposes to reach them—accord with your con-
    ception of what it is right to seek, and of what is the best way
    of seeking it.
    
    The fourth question, What of it?, is changed most of all.
    If, after reading a theoretical book, your view of its subject
    matter is altered more or less, then you are required to make
    some adjustments in your general view of things. (If no ad-
    justments are called for, then you cannot have learned much,
    if anything, from the book.) But these adjustments need not
    be earth-shaking, and above all they do not necessarily imply
    action on your part.
  - |-
    Agreement with a practical book, however, does imply action on your part. If you are convinced or persuaded by the author that the ends he proposes are worthy, and if you are further convinced or persuaded that the means he recommends are likely to achieve those ends, then it is hard to see how you can refuse to act in the way the author wishes you to.
    
    We recognize, of course, that this does not always happen. But we want you to realize what it means when it does not. It means that despite his apparent agreement with the author's ends and acceptance of his means, the reader really does not agree or accept. If he did both, he could not reasonably fail to act.
    
    Let us give an example of what we mean. If, after completing Part Two of this book, you (1) agreed that reading analytically is worthwhile, and (2) accepted the rules of reading as essentially supportive of that aim, then you must have begun to try to read in the manner we have described. If you did not, it is not just because you were lazy or tired. It is because you did not really mean either (1) or (2).
    
    There is one apparent exception to this contention. Suppose, for example, that you read an article about how to make a chocolate mousse. You like chocolate mousse, and so you agree with the author of the article that the end in view is good. You also accept the author's proposed means for attaining the end—his recipe. But you are a male reader who never goes into the kitchen, and so you do not make a mousse. Does this invalidate our point?
  - |-
    It does not, although it does indicate an important distinction between types of practical books that should be mentioned. With regard to the ends proposed by the authors of such works, these are sometimes general or universal—applicable to all human beings—and sometimes applicable only to a certain portion of human beings. If the end is universal—as it is, for example, with this book, which maintains that all persons should read better, not just some—then the implication discussed in this section applies to every reader. If the end is selective, applying only to a certain class of human beings,
    
    202 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    then the reader must decide whether or not he belongs to that
    class. If he does, then the implication applies to him, and he is
    more or less obligated to act in the ways specified by the
    author. If he does not, then he may not be so obligated.
    
    We say "may not be so obligated" because there is a strong
    possibility that the reader may be fooling himself, or misunder-
    standing his own motives, in deciding that he does not belong
    to the class to which the end is relevant. In the case of the
    reader of the article about chocolate mousse, he is probably,
    by his inaction, expressing his view that, although mousse is
    admittedly delicious, someone else—perhaps his wife—should
    be the one to make it. And in many cases, we concede the
    desirability of an end and the feasibility of the means, but in
    one way or another express our reluctance to perform the
    action ourselves. Let someone else do it, we say, more or less
    explicitly.
    
    This, of course, is not primarily a reading problem but
    rather a psychological one. Nevertheless, the psychological
    fact has bearing on how effectively we read a practical book,
    and so we have discussed the matter here.

    HOW TO READ
    IMAGINATIVE LITERATURE
  - |-
    So far, this book has been concerned with only half the reading that most people do. Even that is too liberal an estimate. Probably the greater part of anybody's reading time is spent on newspapers and magazines, and on things that have to be read in connection with one's job. And so far as books are concerned, most of us read more fiction than nonfiction. Furthermore, of the nonfiction books, the most popular are those that, like newspapers and magazines, deal journalistically with matters of contemporary interest.
    
    We have not deceived you about the rules set forth in the preceding chapters. Before undertaking to discuss them in detail, we explained that we would have to limit ourselves to the business of reading serious nonfiction books. To have expounded the rules for reading imaginative and expository literature at the same time would have been confusing. But now we cannot ignore the other types of reading any longer.
    
    Before embarking on the task, we want to emphasize one rather strange paradox. The problem of knowing how to read imaginative literature is inherently much more difficult than the problem of knowing how to read expository books. Nevertheless, it seems to be a fact that such skill is more widely possessed than the art of reading science and philosophy, politics, economics, and history. How can this be true?

    It may be, of course, that people deceive themselves about
    their ability to read novels intelligently. From our teaching
    experience, we know how tongue-tied people become when
    asked to say what they liked about a novel. That they en-
    joyed it is perfectly clear to them, but they cannot give much
    of an account of their enjoyment or tell what the book con-
    tained that caused them pleasure. This might indicate that
    people can be good readers of fiction without being good
    critics. We suspect this is, at best, a half-truth. A critical read-
    ing of anything depends upon the fullness of one's apprehen-
    sion. Those who cannot say what they like about a novel
    probably have not read it below its most obvious surfaces.
    However, there is more to the paradox than that. Imaginative
    literature primarily pleases rather than teaches. It is much
    easier to be pleased than taught, but much harder to know
    why one is pleased. Beauty is harder to analyze than truth.
    
    To make this point clear would require an extensive analy-
    sis of esthetic appreciation. We cannot undertake that here.
    We can, however, give you some advice about how to read
    imaginative literature. We will proceed, first, by the way of
    negation, stating the obvious "don'ts" instead of the construc-
    tive rules. Next, we will proceed by the way of analogy,
    briefly translating the rules for reading nonfiction into their
    equivalents for reading fiction. Finally, in the next chapter, we
    will proceed to examine the problems of reading specific types
    of imaginative literature, namely, novels, plays, and lyric
    poems.
    
    How Not to Read Imaginative Literature
    
    In order to proceed by the way of negation, it is first of
    all necessary to grasp the basic differences between expository
    and imaginative literature. These differences will explain why
    we cannot read a novel as if it were a philosophical argument,
    or a lyric as if it were a mathematical demonstration.
    How to Read Imaginative Literature 205
  - |-
    The most obvious difference, already mentioned, relates  
    to the purposes of the two kinds of writing. Expository books  
    try to convey knowledge—knowledge about experiences that  
    the reader has had or could have. Imaginative ones try to  
    communicate an experience itself—one that the reader can  
    have or share only by reading—and if they succeed, they give  
    the reader something to be enjoyed. Because of their diverse  
    intentions, the two sorts of work appeal differently to the  
    intellect and the imagination.
    
    We experience things through the exercise of our senses  
    and imagination. To know anything we must use our powers  
    of judgment and reasoning, which are intellectual. This does  
    not mean that we can think without using our imagination,  
    or that sense experience is ever wholly divorced from rational  
    insight or reflection. The matter is only one of emphasis.  
    Fiction appeals primarily to the imagination. That is one rea-  
    son for calling it imaginative literature, in contrast to science  
    and philosophy which are intellectual.
    
    This fact about imaginative literature leads to what is  
    probably the most important of the negative injunctions we  
    want to suggest. Don't try to resist the effect that a work of  
    imaginative literature has on you.
    
    We have discussed at length the importance of reading  
    actively. This is true of all books, but it is true in quite differ-  
    ent ways of expository works and of poetry. The reader of the  
    former should be like a bird of prey, constantly alert, always  
    ready to pounce. The kind of activity that is appropriate in  
    reading poetry and fiction is not the same. It is a sort of passive  
    action, if we may be allowed the expression, or, better, active  
    passion. We must act in such a way, when reading a story,  
    that we let it act on us. We must allow it to move us, we must  
    let it do whatever work it wants to do on us. We must some-  
    how make ourselves open to it.
    
    We owe much to the expository literature—the philosophy,  
    science, mathematics—that has shaped the real world in which  
    we live. But we could not live in this world if we were not
  - |-
    How to Read Imaginative Literature 207  
    
    able, from time to time, to get away from it. We do not mean  
    that imaginative literature is always, or essentially, escapist.  
    In the ordinary sense of that term, the idea is contemptible.  
    If we must escape from reality, it should be to a deeper, or  
    greater, reality. This is the reality of our inner life, of our own  
    unique vision of the world. To discover this reality makes us  
    happy; the experience is deeply satisfying to some part of our-  
    selves we do not ordinarily touch. In any event, the rules of  
    reading a great work of literary art should have as an end or  
    goal just such a profound experience. The rules should clear  
    away all that stops us from feeling as deeply as we possibly  
    can.  
    
    The basic difference between expository and imaginative  
    literature leads to another difference. Because of their radically  
    diverse aims, these two kinds of writing necessarily use  
    language differently. The imaginative writer tries to maximize  
    the latent ambiguities of words, in order thereby to gain all  
    the richness and force that is inherent in their multiple mean-  
    ings. He uses metaphors as the units of his construction just as  
    the logical writer uses words sharpened to a single meaning.  
    What Dante said of The Divine Comedy, that it must be read  
    as having several distinct though related meanings, generally  
    applies to poetry and fiction. The logic of expository writing  
    aims at an ideal of unambiguous explicitness. Nothing should  
    be left between the lines. Everything that is relevant and  
    statable should be said as explicitly and clearly as possible. In  
    contrast, imaginative writing relies as much upon what is im-  
    plied as upon what is said. The multiplication of metaphors  
    puts almost more content between the lines than in the words  
    that compose them. The whole poem or story says something  
    that none of its words say or can say.  
    
    From this fact we obtain another negative injunction.  
    Don't look for terms, propositions, and arguments in imagina-  
    tive literature. Such things are logical, not poetic, devices. "In  
    poetry and in drama," the poet Mark Van Doren once ob-  
    served, "statement is one of the obscurer mediums." What a
  - |-
    lyric poem "states," for instance, cannot be found in any of
    its sentences. And the whole, comprising all its words in their
    relations to and reactions upon each other, says something that
    can never be confined within the straitjacket of propositions.
    (However, imaginative literature contains elements that are
    analogous to terms, propositions, and arguments, and we will
    discuss them in a moment. )
    
    Of course, we can learn from imaginative literature, from
    poems and stories and especially, perhaps, plays—but not in
    the same way as we are taught by scientific and philosophical
    books. We learn from experience—the experience that we have
    in the course of our daily lives. So, too, we can learn from the
    vicarious, or artistically created, experiences that fiction pro-
    duces in our imagination. In this sense, poems and stories
    teach as well as please. But the sense in which science and
    philosophy teach us is different. Expository works do not pro-
    vide us with novel experiences. They comment on such experi-
    ences as we already have or can get. That is why it seems right
    to say that expository books teach primarily, while imaginative
    books teach only derivatively, by creating experiences from
    which we can learn. In order to learn from such books, we
    have to do our own thinking about experience; in order to
    learn from scientists and philosophers, we must first try to
    understand the thinking they have done.
    
    Finally, one last negative rule. Don't criticize fiction by
    the standards of truth and consistency that properly apply to
    communication of knowledge. The "truth" of a good story is
    its verisimilitude, its intrinsic probability or plausibility. It
    must be a likely story, but it need not describe the facts of
    life or society in a manner that is verifiable by experiment or
    research, Centuries ago, Aristotle remarked that "the standard
    of correctness is not the same in poetry as in politics," or in
    physics or psychology for that matter. Technical inaccuracies
    about anatomy or errors in geography or history should be
    criticized when the book in which they occur offers itself as a
    treatise on those subjects. But misstatements of fact do not mar
  - |-
    A story is if its teller succeeds in surrounding them with plausibility. When we read history, we want the truth in some sense, and we have a right to complain if we do not get it. When we read a novel we want a story that must be true only in the sense that it could have happened in the world of characters and events that the novelist has created, and re-created in us.
    
    What do we do with a philosophical book, once we have read it and understood it? We test it—against the common experience that was its original inspiration, and that is its only excuse for being. We say, is this true? Have we felt this? Have we always thought this without realizing it? Is this obvious now, though it was not previously? Complicated as the author's theory or explanation may be, is it actually simpler than the chaotic ideas and opinions we had about this subject before?
    
    If we can answer most of these questions in the affirmative, then we are bound by the community of understanding that is between ourselves and the author. When we understand and do not disagree, we must say, "This is our common sense of the matter. We have tested your theory and found it correct."
    
    Not so with poetry. We cannot test Othello, say, against our own experience, unless we too are Moors and wedded to Venetian ladies whom we suspect of treachery. But even if this were so, Othello is not every Moor, and Desdemona is not every Venetian lady; and most such couples would have the good fortune not to know an Iago. In fact, all but one would be so fortunate; Othello, the character as well as the play, is unique.
    
    General Rules for Reading Imaginative Literature
    
    To make the "don'ts" discussed in the last section more helpful, they must be supplemented by constructive suggestions. These suggestions can be developed by analogy from the rules of reading expository works.

    There are, as we have seen, three groups of such rules.
    The first group consists of rules for discovering the unity and
    part-whole structure; the second consists of rules for identify-
    ing and interpreting the book's component terms, propositions,
    and arguments; the third consists of rules for criticizing the
    author's doctrine so that we can reach intelligent agreement or
    disagreement with him. We called these three groups of rules
    structural, interpretive, and critical. By analogy, we can find
    similar sets of rules to guide us in reading poems, novels, and
    plays.
    
    First, we can translate the structural rules—the rules of
    outlining—into their fictional analogues as follows.
    
    (1) You must classify a work of imaginative literature
    according to its kind. A lyric tells its story primarily in terms
    of a single emotional experience, whereas novels and plays
    have much more complicated plots, involving many characters,
    their actions and their reactions upon one another, as well as
    the emotions they suffer in the process. Everyone knows,
    furthermore, that a play differs from a novel by reason of the
    fact that it narrates entirely by means of actions and speeches.
    (There are some interesting exceptions to this, which we will
    mention later.) The playwright can never speak in his own
    person, as the novelist can, and frequently does, in the course
    of a novel. All of these differences in manner of writing call
    for differences in the reader's receptivity. Therefore, you
    should recognize at once the kind of fiction you are reading.
    
    (2) You must grasp the unity of the whole work. Whether
    you have done this or not can be tested by whether you are
    able to express that unity in a sentence or two. The unity of
    an expository work resides ultimately in the main problem
    that it tries to solve. Hence its unity can be stated by the
    formulation of this question, or by the propositions that an-
    swer it. The unity of fiction is also connected with the problem
    the author has faced, but we have seen that that problem is
    the attempt to convey a concrete experience, and so the unity
    of a story is always in its plot. You have not grasped the whole
    story until you can summarize its plot in a brief narration—
    not a proposition or an argument. Therein lies its unity.
  - |-
    Note that there is no real contradiction here between  
    what we have just said about the unity of plot and what we  
    said about the uniqueness of the language of a fictional work.  
    Even a lyric has a "plot" in the sense in which we are using  
    the term here. But the plot is not the concrete experience that  
    is re-created in the reader by the work, be it lyric, play, or  
    novel; it is only the framework of it, or perhaps the occasion  
    of it. It stands for the unity of the work, which is properly in  
    the experience itself, just as the logical summation of the  
    meaning of an expository work stands for the argument of the  
    whole.
    
    (3) You must not only reduce the whole to its simplest  
    unity, but you must also discover how that whole is con-  
    structed out of all its parts. The parts of an expository book are  
    concerned with parts of the whole problem, the partial solu-  
    tions contributing to the solution of the whole. The parts of  
    fiction are the various steps that the author takes to develop  
    his plot—the details of characterization and incident. The way  
    in which the parts are arranged differs in the two cases. In  
    science and philosophy, they must be ordered logically. In a  
    story, the parts must somehow fit into a temporal scheme, a  
    progress from a beginning through the middle to its end. To  
    know the structure of a narrative, you must know where it  
    begins—which is not necessarily on the first page, of course—  
    what it goes through, and where it comes out at. You must  
    know the various crises that lead up to the climax, where and  
    how the climax occurs, and what happens in the aftermath.  
    (By "aftermath" we do not mean what happens after the story  
    is over. Nobody can know that. We mean only what happens,  
    within the narrative, after the climax has occurred. )
    
    An important consequence follows from the points we  
    have just made. The parts or sub-wholes of an expository book  
    are more likely to be independently readable than the parts of  
    fiction. Euclid published his Elements in thirteen parts, or  
    books, as he called them, and the first of them can be read by
  - |-

    Itself. That is more or less the case with every well-organized
    expository book. Its sections or chapters, taken separately or
    in subgroups, make sense. But the chapters of a novel, the
    acts of a play, or the verses of a lyric often become relatively
    meaningless when wrenched from the whole.
    
    Second, what are the interpretive rules for reading fiction?
    Our prior consideration of the difference between a poetic
    and a logical use of language prepares us to make a translation
    of the rules that direct us to find the terms, the propositions,
    and the arguments. We know we should not do that, but we
    must do something analogous to it.
    
    (1) The elements of fiction are its episodes and incidents,
    its characters, and their thoughts, speeches, feelings, and ac-
    tions. Each of these is an element in the world the author
    creates. By manipulating these elements, the author tells his
    story. They are like the terms in logical discourse. Just as you
    must come to terms with an expository writer, so here you
    must become acquainted with the details of incident and
    characterization. You have not grasped a story until you are
    familiar with its characters, until you have lived through its
    events.
    
    (2) Terms are connected in propositions. The elements
    of fiction are connected by the total scene or background
    against which they stand out in relief. The imaginative writer,
    we have seen, creates a world in which his characters "live,
    move, and have their being." The fictional analogue of the rule
    that directs you to find the author's propositions can, therefore,
    be stated as follows: become at home in this imaginary world;
    know it as if you were an observer on the scene; become a
    member of its population, willing to befriend its characters,
    and able to participate in its happenings by sympathetic in-
    sight, as you would do in the actions and sufferings of a friend.
    If you can do this, the elements of fiction will cease to be so
    many isolated pawns moved about mechanically on a chess-
    board. You will have found the connections that vitalize them
    into members of a living society.
    
    (3) If there is any motion in an expository book, it is the
  - |-

    movement of the argument, a logical transition from evidences
    and reasons to the conclusions they support. In the reading
    of such books, it is necessary to follow the argument. Hence,
    after you have discovered its terms and propositions, you are
    called upon to analyze its reasoning. There is an analogous
    last step in the interpretive reading of fiction. You have be-
    come acquainted with the characters. You have joined them in
    the imaginary world wherein they dwell, consented to the
    laws of their society, breathed its air, tasted its food, traveled
    its highways. Now you must follow them through their ad-
    ventures. The scene or background, the social setting, is (like
    the proposition ) a kind of static connection of the elements of
    fiction. The unraveling of the plot (like the arguments or rea-
    soning ) is the dynamic connection. Aristotle said that plot is
    the soul of a story. It is its life. To read a story well you must
    have your finger on the pulse of the narrative, be sensitive to
    its very beat.
    
    Before leaving these fictional equivalents for the interpre-
    tive rules of reading, we must caution you not to examine the
    analogy too closely. An analogy of this sort is like a metaphor
    that will disintegrate if you press it too hard. The three steps
    we have suggested outline the way in which one becomes
    progressively aware of the artistic achievement of an imagina-
    tive writer. Far from spoiling your enjoyment of a novel or
    play, they should enable you to enrich your pleasure by know-
    ing intimately the sources of your delight. You will not only
    know what you like but also why you like it.
    
    One other caution: the foregoing rules apply mainly to
    novels and plays. To the extent that lyric poems have some
    narrative line, they apply to lyrics also. But the rules do not
    cease to apply to non-narrative lyrics, although the connection
    is much less close. A lyric is the representation of a concrete
    experience, just like a long story, and it attempts to re-create
    that experience in the reader. There is a beginning, middle,
    and end of even the shortest lyric, just as there is a temporal
    sequence in any experience, no matter how brief and fleeting.
  - |-
    And though the cast of characters may be very small in a short
    lyric, there is always at least one character—namely, the
    speaker of the poem.
    
    Third, and last, what are the critical rules for reading fiction?
    You may remember that we distinguished, in the case of ex-
    pository works, between the general maxims governing criti-
    cism and a number of particular points—specific critical re-
    marks. With respect to the general maxims, the analogy can
    be sufficiently drawn by one translation. Where, in the case of
    expository works, the advice was not to criticize a book—not
    to say you agree or disagree—until you can first say you under-
    stand, so here the maxim is: don't criticize imaginative writing
    until you fully appreciate what the author has tried to make
    you experience.
    
    There is an important corollary to this. The good reader of
    a story does not question the world that the author creates—
    the world that is re-created in himself. "We must grant the
    artist his subject, his idea, his donné," said Henry James in
    The Art of Fiction; "our criticism is applied only to what he
    makes of it." That is, we must merely appreciate the fact that
    a writer sets his story in, say, Paris, and not object that it would
    have been better to set it in Minneapolis; but we have a right
    to criticize what he does with his Parisians and with the city
    itself.
    
    In other words, we must remember the obvious fact that
    we do not agree or disagree with fiction. We either like it or
    we do not. Our critical judgment in the case of expository
    books concerns their truth, whereas in criticizing belles-lettres,
    as the word itself suggests, we consider chiefly their beauty.
    The beauty of any work of art is related to the pleasure it
    gives us when we know it well.
    
    Let us restate the maxims, then, in the following manner.
    Before you express your likes and dislikes, you must first be
    sure that you have made an honest effort to appreciate the
    work. By appreciation, we mean having the experience that
    the author tried to produce for you by working on your emo-

    tions and imagination. Thus, you cannot appreciate a novel by
    reading it passively (indeed, as we have remarked, you must
    read it passionately) any more than you can understand a
    philosophical book that way. To achieve appreciation, as to
    achieve understanding, you must read actively, and that means
    performing all the acts of analytical reading that we have
    briefly outlined.
    
    After you have completed such a reading, you are com-
    petent to judge. Your first judgment will naturally be one of
    taste. You will say not only that you like or dislike the book,
    but also why. The reasons you give will, of course, have some
    critical relevance to the book itself, but in their first expression
    they are more likely to be about you—your preferences and
    prejudices—than about the book. Hence, to complete the task
    of criticism, you must objectify your reactions by pointing to
    those things in the book that caused them. You must pass from
    saying what you like or dislike and why, to saying what is
    good or bad about the book and why.
    
    The better you can reflectively discern the causes of your
    pleasure in reading fiction or poetry, the nearer you will come
    to knowing the artistic virtues in the literary work itself. You
    will thus gradually develop a standard of criticism. And you
    will probably find a large company of men and women of
    similar taste to share your critical judgments. You may even
    discover, what we think is true, that good taste in literature is
    acquired by anyone who learns to read.

    SUGGESTIONS FOR READING
    STORIES, PLAYS, AND POEMS
    
    The parallel rules for reading imaginative literature that were
    discussed in the last chapter were general ones, applying
    across the board to all kinds of imaginative literature—novels
    and stories, whether in prose or verse (including epics); plays,
    whether tragedies or comedies or something in between; and
    lyric poems, of whatever length or complexity.
  - |-
    These rules, being general, must be adapted somewhat  
    when they are applied to the different kinds of imaginative  
    literature. In this chapter we want to suggest the adaptations  
    that are required. We will have something particular to say  
    about the reading of stories, plays, and lyric poems, and we  
    will also include notes on the special problems presented by  
    the reading of epic poems and the great Greek tragedies.
    
    Before proceeding to those matters, however, it is desir-  
    able to make some remarks about the last of the four questions  
    that the active and demanding reader must ask of any book,  
    when that question is asked of a work of imaginative literature.
    
    You will recall that the first three questions are: first,  
    What is the book about as a whole?; second, What is being  
    said in detail, and how?; and third, Is the book true, in whole  
    or part? The application of these three questions to imagina-  
    tive literature was covered in the last chapter. The first ques-  
    tion is answered when you are able to describe the unity of  
    the plot of a story, play, or poem—"plot" being construed  
    
    215  
    
    216 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    broadly to include the action or movement of a lyric poem as  
    well as of a story. The second question is answered when you  
    are able to discern the role that the various characters play,  
    and recount, in your own words, the key incidents and events  
    in which they are involved. And the third question is answered  
    when you are able to give a reasoned judgment about the  
    poetical truth of the work. Is it a likely story? Does the work  
    satisfy your heart and your mind? Do you appreciate the  
    beauty of the work? In each case, can you say why?
  - |-
    The fourth question is, What of it? In the case of exposi-
    tory books, an answer to this question implies some kind of
    action on your part. "Action," here, does not always mean
    going out and doing something. We have suggested that that
    kind of action is an obligation for the reader when he agrees
    with a practical work—that is, agrees with the ends proposed
    —and accepts as appropriate the means by which the author
    says they can be attained. Action in this sense is not obligatory
    when the expository work is theoretical. There, mental action
    alone is required. But if you are convinced that such a book
    is true, in whole or part, then you must agree with its conclu-
    sions, and if they imply some adjustment of your views of the
    subject, then you are more or less required to make those
    adjustments.
    
    Now it is important to recognize that, in the case of a
    work of imaginative literature, this fourth and final question
    must be interpreted quite differently. In a sense, the question
    is irrelevant to the reading of stories and poems. Strictly speak-
    ing, no action whatever is called for on your part when you
    have read a novel, play, or poem well—that is, analytically.
    You have discharged all of your responsibilities as a reader
    when you have applied the parallel rules of analytical reading
    to such works, and answered the first three questions.
    
    We say "strictly speaking," because it is obvious that
    imaginative works have often led readers to act in various
    ways. Sometimes a story is a better way of getting a point
    across—be it a political, economic, or moral point—than an ex-
    pository work making the same point. George Orwell's Animal

    Farm and his 1984 are both powerful attacks on totalitarianism.
    Aldous Huxley's Brave New World is an eloquent diatribe
    against the tyranny of technological progress. Alexander
    Solzhenitsyn's The First Circle tells us more about the petty
    cruelty and inhumanity of the Soviet bureaucracy than a
    hundred factual studies and reports. Such works have been
    banned and censored many times in the history of mankind,
    and the reason for that is clear. As E. B. White once remarked,
    "A despot doesn't fear eloquent writers preaching freedom—
    he fears a drunken poet who may crack a joke that will take
    hold."
    
    Nevertheless, such practical consequences of the reading
    of stories and poems are not of the essence of the matter.
    Imaginative writings can lead to action, but they do not have
    to. They belong in the realm of fine art.
    
    A work of fine art is "fine" not because it is "refined" or
    "finished," but because it is an end (finis, Latin, means end)
    in itself. It does not move toward some result beyond itself.
    It is, as Emerson said of beauty, its own excuse for being.
    
    Therefore, when it comes to applying this last question to
    works of imaginative literature, you should do so with caution.
    If you feel impelled because of a book you have read to go
    out and do something, ask yourself whether the work contains
    some implied statement that has produced this feeling. Poetry,
    properly speaking, is not the realm of statement, although
    many stories and poems have statements in them, more or less
    deeply buried. And it is quite right to take heed of them, and
    to react to them. But you should remember that you are then
    taking heed of and reacting to something other than the story
    or poem itself. That subsists in its own right. To read it well,
    all you have to do is experience it.
    
    How to Read Stories
    
    The first piece of advice we would like to give you for
    reading a story is this: Read it quickly and with total immer-

    Here is the text with all formatting errors fixed and presented verbatim:

    Version. Ideally, a story should be read at one sitting, although
    this is rarely possible for busy people with long novels. Never-
    theless, the ideal should be approximated by compressing the
    reading of a good story into as short a time as feasible. Other-
    wise you will forget what happened, the unity of the plot will
    escape you, and you will be lost.
    
    Some readers, when they really like a novel, want to
    savor it, to pause over it, to draw out the reading of it for as
    long as they can. But in this case they are probably not so
    much reading the book as satisfying their more or less uncon-
    scious feelings about the events and the characters. We will
    return to that in a moment.
    
    Read quickly, we suggest, and with total immersion. We
    have indicated the importance of letting an imaginative book
    work on you. That is what we mean by the latter phrase. Let
    the characters into your mind and heart; suspend your dis-
    belief, if such it is, about the events. Do not disapprove of
    something a character does before you understand why he
    does it—if then. Try as hard as you can to live in his world,
    not in yours; there, the things he does may be quite under-
    standable. And do not judge the world as a whole until you
    are sure that you have "lived" in it to the extent of your
    ability.
    
    Following this rule will allow you to answer the first
    question you should ask about any book—What is it about, as
    a whole? Unless you read it quickly you will fail to see the
    unity of the story. Unless you read intensely you will fail to
    see the details.
    
    The terms of a story, as we have observed, are its char-
    acters and incidents. You must become acquainted with them,
    and be able to sort them out. But here a word of warning, To
    take War and Peace as an example, many readers start this
    great novel and are overwhelmed by the vast number of
    characters to whom they are introduced, especially since they
    all have strange-sounding names. They soon give up on the
    book in the belief that they will never be able to sort out all

    the complicated relationships, to know who is who. This is
    true of any big novel—and if a novel is really good, we want it
    to be as big as possible.
    
    It does not always occur to such fainthearted readers that
    exactly the same thing happens to them when they move to a
    new town or part of a town, when they go to a new school or
    job, or even when they arrive at a party. They do not give up
    in those circumstances; they know that after a short while
    individuals will begin to be visible in the mass, friends will
    emerge from the faceless crowd of fellow-workers, fellow-
    students, or fellow-guests. We may not remember the names
    of everyone we met at a party, but we will recall the name of
    the man we talked to for an hour, or the girl with whom we
    made a date for the next evening, or the mother whose child
    goes to the same school as ours. The same thing happens in a
    novel. We should not expect to remember every character;
    many of them are merely background persons, who are there
    only to set off the actions of the main characters. However, by
    the time we have finished War and Peace or any big novel,
    we know who is important, and we do not forget. Pierre,
    Andrew, Natasha, Princess Mary, Nicholas—the names are
    likely to come immediately to memory, although it may have
    been years since we read Tolstoy's book.
    
    We also, despite the plethora of incidents, soon learn
    what is important. Authors generally give a good deal of help
    in this respect; they do not want the reader to miss what is
    essential to the unfolding of the plot, so they flag it in various
    ways. But our point is that you should not be anxious if all is
    not clear from the beginning. Actually, it should not be clear
    then. A story is like life itself; in life, we do not expect to
    understand events as they occur, at least with total clarity, but
    looking back on them, we do understand. So the reader of a
    story, looking back on it after he has finished it, understands
    the relation of events and the order of actions.
  - |-
    All of this comes down to the same point: you must finish a story in order to be able to say that you have read it well.
    220 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    Paradoxically, however, a story ceases to be like life on its last page. Life goes on, but the story does not. Its characters have no vitality outside the book, and your imagination of what happens to them before the first page and after the last is only as good as the next reader's. Actually, all such speculations are meaningless. Preludes to Hamlet have been written, but they are ridiculous. We should not ask what happens to Pierre and Natasha after War and Peace ends. We are satisfied with Shakespeare's and Tolstoy's creations partly because they are limited in time. We need no more.
    
    The great majority of books that are read are stories of one kind or another. People who cannot read listen to stories. We even make them up for ourselves. Fiction seems to be a necessity for human beings. Why is this?
    
    One reason why fiction is a human necessity is that it satisfies many unconscious as well as conscious needs. It would be important if it only touched the conscious mind, as expositional writing does. But fiction is important, too, because it also touches the unconscious.
    
    On the simplest level—and a discussion of this subject could be very complex—we like or dislike certain kinds of people more than others, without always being sure why. If, in a novel, such people are rewarded or punished, we may have stronger feelings, either pro or con, about the book than it merits artistically.
    
    For example, we are often pleased when a character in a novel inherits money, or otherwise comes into good fortune. However, this tends to be true only if the character is "sympathetic"—meaning that we can identify with him or her. We do not admit to ourselves that we would like to inherit the money, we merely say that we like the book.
  - |-
    Perhaps we would all like to love more richly than we do.
    Many novels are about love—most are, perhaps—and it gives
    us pleasure to identify with the loving characters. They are
    free, and we are not. But we may not want to admit this; for
    Suggestions for Reading Stories, Plays, and Poems 221
    
    to do so might make us feel, consciously, that our own loves
    are inadequate.
    
    Again, almost everyone has some unconscious sadism and
    masochism in his makeup. These are often satisfied in novels,
    where we can identify with either the conqueror or victim, or
    even with both. In each case, we are prone to say simply that
    we like "that kind of book"—without specifying or really know-
    ing why.
    
    Finally, we suspect that life as we know it is unjust. Why
    do good people suffer, and bad ones prosper? We do not know,
    we cannot know, but the fact causes great anxiety in everyone.
    In stories, this chaotic and unpleasant situation is adjusted,
    and that is extremely satisfying to us.
    
    In stories—in novels and narrative poems and plays—
    justice usually does exist. People get what they deserve; the
    author, who is like a god to his characters, sees to it that they
    are rewarded or punished according to their true merit. In a
    good story, in a satisfying one, this is usually so, at least. One
    of the most irritating things about a bad story is that the
    people in it seem to be punished or rewarded with no rhyme
    or reason. The great storyteller makes no mistakes. He is able
    to convince us that justice—poetic justice, we call it—has been
    done.
    
    This is true even of high tragedy. There, terrible things
    happen to good men, but we see that the hero, even if he does
    not wholly deserve his fate, at least comes to understand it.
    And we have a profound desire to share his understanding. If
    we only knew—then we could withstand whatever the world
    has in store for us. "I Want to Know Why" is the title of a
    story by Sherwood Anderson. It could be the title of many
    stories. The tragic hero does learn why, though often, of
    course, only after the ruin of his life. We can share his insight
    without sharing his suffering.
  - |-
    Thus, in criticizing fiction we must be careful to dis-
    tinguish those books that satisfy our own particular uncon-
    scious needs—the ones that make us say, "I like this book,
    although I don't really know why"—from those that satisfy the
    deep unconscious needs of almost everybody. The latter are
    undoubtedly the great stories, the ones that live on and on for
    generations and centuries. As long as man is man, they will go
    on satisfying him, giving him something that he needs to
    have—a belief in justice and understanding and the allaying of
    anxiety. We do not know, we cannot be sure, that the real
    world is good. But the world of a great story is somehow good.
    We want to live there as often and as long as we can.
    
    A Note About Epics
    
    Perhaps the most honored but probably the least read
    books in the great tradition of the Western World are the
    major epic poems, particularly the Iliad and Odyssey of
    Homer, Virgil's Aeneid, Dante's Divine Comedy, and Milton's
    Paradise Lost. This paradox requires some comment.
    
    Judging by the very small number that have been com-
    pleted successfully in the past 2,500 years, a long epic poem is
    apparently the most difficult thing a man can write. This
    is not for want of trying; hundreds of epics have been begun,
    and some—for example, Wordsworth's Prelude and Byron's
    Don Juan—have grown to extensive proportions without ever
    really being finished. So honor is due the poet who sticks to
    the task and completes it. Greater honor is due him if he pro-
    duces a work that has the qualities of the five just mentioned.
    But they are certainly not easy to read.
    
    This is not only because they are written in verse—for in
    every case except that of Paradise Lost, prose translations are
    available to us. The difficulty seems rather to lie in their eleva-
    tion, in their approach to their subject matter. Any of these
    major epics exerts enormous demands on the reader—demands
    of attention, of involvement, and of imagination. The effort
    required to read them is very great indeed.
    
    Most of us are not aware of the loss we suffer by not
  - |-
    making that effort. For the rewards to be gained from a good  
    reading—an analytical reading, as we should say—of these  
    epics are at least as great as those to be gained from the read-  
    ing of any other books, certainly any other works of fiction.  
    Unfortunately, however, these rewards are not gained by  
    readers who do less than a good job on these books.  
    
    We hope that you will take a stab at reading these five  
    great epic poems, and that you will manage to get through  
    all of them. We are certain you will not be disappointed if you  
    do. And you will be able to enjoy a further satisfaction. Homer,  
    Virgil, Dante, and Milton—they are the authors that every  
    good poet, to say nothing of other writers, has read. Along  
    with the Bible, they constitute the backbone of any serious  
    reading program.  
    
    How to Read Plays  
    
    A play is fiction, a story, and insofar as that is true, it  
    should be read like a story. Perhaps the reader has to be more  
    active in creating the background, the world in which the  
    characters live and move, for there is no description in plays  
    such as abounds in novels. But the problems are essentially  
    similar.  
    
    However, there is one important difference. When you  
    read a play, you are not reading a complete work. The com-  
    plete play (the work that the author intended you to appre-  
    hend) is only apprehended when it is acted on a stage. Like  
    music, which must be heard, a play lacks a physical dimension  
    when we read it in a book. The reader must supply that di-  
    mension.  
    
    The only way to do that is to make a pretense of seeing it  
    acted. Therefore, once you have discovered what the play is  
    about, as a whole and in detail, and once you have answered  
    the other questions you must ask about any story, then try  
    directing the play. Imagine that you have half a dozen good  
    actors before you, awaiting your commands. Tell them how to  
    say this line, how to play that scene. Explain the importance of these few words, and how that action is the climax of the  
    work. You will have a lot of fun, and you will learn a lot about  
    the play.

    An example will show what we mean. In Hamlet, Act II,
    Scene ii, Polonius announces to the king and queen that Ham-
    let is insane because of his love for Ophelia, who has spurned
    the prince's advances. The king and queen are doubtful, where-
    upon Polonius proposes that the king and he hide behind an
    arras, in order to overhear a conversation between Hamlet and
    Ophelia. This proposal occurs in Act II, Scene ii, at lines
    160-170; immediately thereafter Hamlet enters, reading. His
    speeches to Polonius are enigmatic; as Polonius says, "though
    this be madness, yet there is method in't!" Later on, early in
    Act III, Hamlet enters and delivers the famous soliloquy, be-
    ginning "To be or not to be," and then is interrupted by catch-
    ing sight of Ophelia. He speaks to her quite reasonably for a
    time, but suddenly he cries: "Ha, ha! are you honest?" (III, i,
    line 103). Now the question is, has Hamlet overheard Polonius
    say earlier that he and the king planned to spy on him? And
    did he perhaps also hear Polonius say that he would "loose my
    daughter to him'? If so Hamlet's conversations with both
    Polonius and Ophelia would mean one thing; if he did not
    overhear the plotting, they would mean another. Shakespeare
    left no stage directions; the reader (or director) must decide
    for himself. Your own decision will be central to your under-
    standing of the play.
    
    Many of Shakespeare's plays require this kind of activity
    on the part of the reader. Our point is that it is always desir-
    able, no matter how explicit the playwright was in telling us
    exactly what we should expect to see. (We cannot question
    what we are to hear, since the play's words are before us.)
    Probably you have not read a play really well until you have
    pretended to put it on the stage in this way. At best, you have
    given it only a partial reading.

    Earlier, we suggested that there were interesting exceptions to the rule that the playwright cannot speak directly to the reader as the author of a novel can and often does. (Fielding, in Tom Jones, is an example of this direct addressing of the reader in one great novel.) Two of these exceptions are separated by nearly twenty-five centuries of time. Aristophanes, the ancient Greek comic playwright, wrote the only examples of what is called Old Comedy that survive. From time to time in an Aristophanic play, and always at least once, the leading actor would step out of character, perhaps move forward toward the audience, and deliver a political speech that had nothing whatever to do with the action of the drama. It is felt that these speeches were expressions of the author's personal feelings. This is occasionally done nowadays—no useful artistic device is ever really lost—but perhaps not as effectively as Aristophanes did it.
    
    The other example is that of Shaw, who not only expected his plays to be acted but also hoped that they would be read. He published them all, at least one (Heartbreak House) before it was ever acted, and accompanied the publication with long prefaces in which he explained the meaning of the plays and told his readers how to understand them. (He also included very extensive stage directions in the published versions.) To read a Shavian play without reading the preface Shaw wrote for it is to turn one's back intentionally on an important aid to understanding. Again, other modern playwrights have imitated Shaw in this device, but never as effectively as he did.
    
    One other bit of advice may be helpful, particularly in reading Shakespeare. We have already suggested the importance of reading the plays through, as nearly as possible at one sitting, in order to get a feel for the whole. But, since the plays are mostly in verse, and since the verse is more or less opaque in places because of changes in the language that have occurred since 1600, it is often desirable to read a puzzling passage out loud.

    A Note About Tragedy
    
    Most plays are not worth reading. This, we think, is because they are incomplete. They were not meant to be read—they were meant to be acted. There are many great expository works, and many great novels, stories, and lyric poems, but there are only a few great plays. However, those few—the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripedes, the plays of Shakespeare, Molière's comedies, the works of a very few moderns—are very great indeed, for they contain within them some of the deepest and richest insights men have ever expressed in words.
    
    Among these, Greek tragedy is probably the toughest nut to crack for beginning readers. For one thing, in the ancient world three tragedies were presented at one time, the three often dealing with a common theme, but except in one case (the Oresteia of Aeschylus) only single plays (or acts) survive. For another, it is almost impossible to stage the plays mentally, since we know almost nothing about how the Greek directors did it. For still another, the plays often are based on stories that were well known to their audiences but are known to us only through the plays. It is one thing to know the story of Oedipus, for example, as well as we know the story of George Washington and the Cherry Tree, and thus to view Sophocles' masterpiece as a commentary on a familiar tale; and it is quite another to see Oedipus Rex as the primary story and try to imagine the familiar tale that provided the background.
    
    Nevertheless, the plays are so powerful that they triumph over even these obstacles, as well as others. It is important to read them well, for they not only can tell us much about life
  - |-
    As we still live it, but they also form a kind of literary framework for many other plays written much later—for example, Racine's and O'Neill's. We have two bits of advice that may help.
    
    The first is to remember that the essence of tragedy is time, or rather the lack of it. There is no problem in any Greek tragedy that could not have been solved if there had been enough time, but there is never enough. Decisions, choices have to be made in a moment, there is no time to think and weigh the consequences; and, since even tragic heroes are fallible—especially fallible, perhaps—the decisions are wrong. It is easy for us to see what should have been done, but would we have been able to see in time? That is the question that you should always ask in reading any Greek tragedy.
    
    The second bit of advice is this. One thing we do know about the staging of Greek plays is that the tragic actors wore buskins on their feet that elevated them several inches above the ground. (They also wore masks.) But the members of the chorus did not wear buskins, though they sometimes wore masks. The comparison between the size of the tragic protagonists, on the one hand, and the members of the chorus, on the other hand, was thus highly significant. Therefore you should always imagine, when you read the words of the chorus, that the words are spoken by persons of your own stature; while the words spoken by the protagonists proceed from the mouths of giants, from personages who did not only seem, but actually were, larger than life.
    
    How to Read Lyric Poetry
    
    The simplest definition of poetry (in the somewhat limited sense implied by the title of this section) is that it is what poets write. That seems obvious enough, and yet there are those who would dispute the definition. Poetry, they hold, is a kind of spontaneous overflowing of the personality, which may be ex-

    pressed in written words but may also take the form of physical
    action, or more or less musical sound, or even just feeling.
    There is something to this, of course, and poets have always
    recognized it. It is a very old notion that the poet reaches down
    deep into himself to produce his poems, that their place of
    origin is a mysterious "well of creation" within the mind or
    soul. In this sense of the term, poetry can be made by anyone
    at any time, in a kind of solitary sensitivity session. But al-
    though we admit that there is a kernel of truth in this defi-
    nition, the meaning of the term that we will be employing in
    what follows is much narrower. Whatever may be the origin
    of the poetic impulse, poetry, for us, consists of words, and
    what is more, of words that are arranged in a more or less
    orderly and disciplined way,
    
    Other definitions of the term that similarly contain a
    kernel of truth are that poetry (again, primarily lyric poetry)
    is not truly poetry unless it praises, or unless it rouses to action
    (usually revolutionary), or unless it is written in rhyme, or
    unless it employs a specialized language that is called "poetic
    diction." In that sentence we have intentionally mixed to-
    gether some very modern and some very antiquated notions.
    Our point is that all of these definitions, and a dozen more
    that we might mention, are too narrow, just as the definition
    discussed in the last paragraph was too broad (for us).
    
    Between such very broad and such very narrow definitions
    lies a central core that most people, if they were feeling reason-
    able about the matter, would admit was poetry. If we tried to
    state precisely what the central core consisted in, we would
    probably get into trouble, and so we will not try. Nevertheless,
    we are certain that you know what we mean. We are certain
    that nine times out of ten, or perhaps even ninety-nine times
    out of a hundred, you would agree with us that X was a poem
    and Y was not. And that is fully sufficient for our purposes in
    the following pages.
    
    Many people believe that they cannot read lyric poetry—
    especially modern poetry. They think that it is often difficult,

    obscure, complex, and that it demands so much attention, so
    much work on their part, that it is not worthwhile. We would
    say two things. First, lyric poetry, even modern poetry, does
    not always demand as much work as you may think if you go
    about reading it in the right way. Second, it is often worth
    whatever effort you are willing to spend.
    
    We do not mean that you should not work on a poem. A
    good poem can be worked at, re-read, and thought about over
    and over for the rest of your life. You will never stop finding
    new things in it, new pleasures and delights, and also new
    ideas about yourself and the world. We mean that the initial
    task of bringing a poem close enough to you to work on it is
    not as hard as you may have believed.
    
    The first rule to follow in reading a lyric is to read it
    through without stopping, whether you think you understand
    it or not. This is the same rule that we have suggested for many
    different kinds of books, but it is more important for a poem
    than it is for a philosophical or scientific treatise, and even for
    a novel or play.
    
    In fact, the trouble so many people seem to have in read-
    ing poems, especially the difficult modern ones, stems from
    their unawareness of this first rule of reading them. When
    faced by a poem of T. S. Eliot or Dylan Thomas or some other
    "obscure" modern, they plunge in with a will, but are brought
    up short by the first line or stanza. They do not understand it
    immediately and in its entirety, and they think they should.
    They puzzle over the words, try to unwind the complicated
    skein of the syntax, and soon give up, concluding that, as they
    suspected, modern poetry is just too difficult for them.
    
    It is not only modern lyrics that are difficult. Many of the
    best poems in the language are complicated and involved in
    their language and thought. Besides, many apparently simple
    poems have immense complexity under the surface.
    
    But any good lyric poem has a unity. Unless we read all
    of it, and all at once, we cannot comprehend its unity. We can-
    not discover, except possibly by accident, the basic feeling or
  - |-

     experience that underlies it. In particular, the essence of a
    poem is almost never to be found in its first line, or even in its
    first stanza. It is to be found only in the whole, and not conclu-
    sively in any part.
    
    The second rule for reading lyrics is this: Read the poem
    through again—but read it out loud. We have suggested this be-
    fore, in the case of poetic dramas like Shakespeare's. There it
    was helpful; here it is essential. You will find, as you read the
    poem out loud, that the very act of speaking the words forces
    you to understand them better. You cannot glide over a mis-
    understood phrase or line quite so easily if you are speaking it.
    Your ear is offended by a misplaced emphasis that your eyes
    might miss. And the rhythm of the poem, and its rhymes, if it
    has them, will help you to understand by making you place the
    emphasis where it belongs. Finally, you will be able to open
    yourself to the poem, and let it work on you, as it should.
    
    In the reading of lyrics, these first two suggestions are
    more important than anything else. We think that if readers
    who believe they cannot read poems would obey these rules
    first, they would have little difficulty afterwards. For once you
    have apprehended a poem in its unity, even if this apprehen-
    sion is vague, you can begin to ask it questions. And as with
    expository works, that is the secret of understanding.
    
    The questions you ask of an expository work are gram-
    matical and logical. The questions you ask of a lyric are
    usually rhetorical, though they may also be syntactical. You do
    not come to terms with a poem; but you must discover the key
    words. You discover them not primarily by an act of gram-
    matical discernment, however, but by an act of rhetorical
    discernment. Why do certain words pop out of the poem and
    stare you in the face? Is it because the rhythm marks them? Or
    the rhyme? Or are the words repeated? Do several stanzas
    seem to be about the same ideas; if so, do these ideas form any
    kind of sequence? Anything of this sort that you can discover
    will help your understanding.

    In most good lyrics there is some kind of conflict. Some-
    Suggestions for Reading Stories, Plays, and Poems 231
    
    times two antagonists—either individual people, or images, or
    ideas—are named, and then the conflict between them is de-
    scribed. If so, this is easy to discover. But often the conflict is
    only implied and not stated. For example, a large number of
    great lyric poems—perhaps even the majority of them—are
    about the conflict between love and time, between life and
    death, between the beauty of transient things and the tri-
    umph of eternity. But these words may not be mentioned in
    the poem itself.
    
    It has been said that almost all of Shakespeare's sonnets
    are about the ravages of what he calls "Devouring time." It is
    clear that some of them are, for he explicitly says so again and
    again.
    
    When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
    The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age
    
    he writes in the 64th sonnet and lists other victories that time
    gains over all that man wishes were proof against it. Then he
    says:
    
    Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
    That Time will come and take my love away.
    
    There is no question what that sonnet is about. Similarly with
    the famous 116th sonnet, which contains these lines:
    
    Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
    Within his bending sickle's compass come;
    
    Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
    
    But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
    
    But the almost equally famous 138th sonnet, which begins with
    the lines:
    
    When my love swears that she is made of truth
    I do believe her, though I know she lies,
    
    232 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    is also about the conflict between love and time, although the
    word "time" appears nowhere in the poem.
    
    That you will see without much difficulty. Nor is there any
    difficulty in seeing that Marvell's celebrated lyric "To His Coy
    Mistress" is about the same subject, for he makes this clear
    right at the beginning:
    
    Had we but world enough, and time,
    This coyness, lady, were no crime.
  - |-
    ... at my back I always hear  
    Time's wingéd chariot hurrying near;  
    And yonder all before us lie  
    
    Deserts of vast eternity.  
    
    Therefore, he adjures his mistress,  
    
    Let us roll all our strength and all  
    
    Our sweetness up into one ball,  
    
    And tear our pleasures with rough strife  
    Through the iron gates of life.  
    
    Thus, though we cannot make our sun  
    Stand still, yet we will make him run.  
    
    It is perhaps a bit harder to see that the subject of "You,  
    Andrew Marvell," by Archibald MacLeish, is exactly the same.  
    The poem begins:  
    
    And here face down beneath the sun  
    And here upon earth's noonward height  
    To feel the always coming on  
    
    The always rising of the night  
    
    Thus MacLeish asks us to imagine someone (the poet? the  
    speaker? the reader?) as lying in the noonday sun—but all the  
    same, in the midst of that brightness and warmth, aware of  
    "the earthly chill of dusk." He imagines the line of the shadow  
    of the setting sun—of all the cumulative successive setting  
    suns of history—moving across the world, across Persia, and  
    Baghdad . . . he feels "Lebanon fade out and Crete," "And  
    Spain go under and the shore / Of Africa the gilded sand,"  
    and ... "now the long light on the sea" vanishes, too. And he  
    concludes:  
    
    And here face downward in the sun  
    To feel how swift, how secretly,  
    The shadow of the night comes on. ...  
    
    The word "time" is not used in the poem, nor is there any  
    mention of a lover. Nevertheless, the title reminds us of Mar-  
    vell's lyric with its theme of "Had we but world enough and  
    time," and thus the combination of the poem itself and its title  
    invokes the same conflict, between love (or life) and time, that  
    was the subject of the other poems we have considered here.
  - |-
    One final piece of advice about reading lyric poems. In  
    general, readers of such works feel that they must know more  
    about the authors and their times than they really have to. We  
    put much faith in commentaries, criticism, biographies—but  
    this may be only because we doubt our own ability to read. Almost everyone can read any poem, if he will go to work on  
    it. Anything you discover about an author's life or times is  
    valid and may be helpful. But a vast knowledge of the context  
    of a poem is no guarantee that the poem itself will be under-  
    stood. To be understood it must be read—over and over. Read-  
    ing any great lyric poem is a lifetime job—not, of course, in the  
    sense that it should go on and on throughout a lifetime, but  
    rather that as a great poem, it deserves many return visits. And  
    during vacations from a given poem, we may learn more about  
    it than we realize.

    HOW TO READ HISTORY  
    
    "History," like "poetry," is a word of many meanings. In order  
    for this chapter to be useful to you, we must come to terms  
    with you about the word—that is, explain how we will be using  
    it.  
    
    First of all, there is the difference between history as fact  
    and history as a written record of the facts. We are obviously,  
    here, employing the term in the latter sense, since in our sense  
    of "read" you cannot read facts. But there are many kinds of  
    written record that are called historical. A collection of docu-  
    ments pertaining to a certain event or period could be called a  
    history of it. A transcription of an oral interview with a partici-  
    pant, or a collection of such transcriptions, could similarly be  
    called a history of the event in which he or they participated. A work having quite a different intention, such as a personal  
    diary or collection of letters, could be construed as being a  
    history of the time. The word could be applied, and indeed has  
    been applied, to almost every kind of writing that originated  
    in a time period, or in the context of an event, in which the  
    reader was interested.
  - |-
    The sense in which we use the word "history" in what follows is both narrower and broader than any of those. It is narrower because we want to restrict ourselves to essentially narrative accounts, presented in a more or less formal manner,
    
    234
    
    How to Read History 235
    
    of a period or event or series of events in the past. This is a traditional use of the term, and we do not apologize for it.
    Again, as with our definition of lyric poetry, we think you will agree with us that this is the ordinary meaning of the term, and we want to stick to the ordinary here.
    
    But our meaning is also broader than many of the definitions of the term that are current today. We think, although not all historians agree with us, that the essence of history is narration, that the last five letters of the word—"story"—help us to understand the basic meaning. Even a collection of documents, as a collection, tells a story. That story may not be explicit—that is, the historian may try not to arrange the documents in any "meaningful" order. But it is implicit in them, whether they are ordered or not. Otherwise, we think, the collection would not be called a history of its time.
    
    It is not important, however, whether all historians agree with us in our notion of what history is. There is a great deal of history of the kind we are discussing, and you will want to or have to read at least some of it. We will try to aid you in that task.
    
    The Elusiveness of Historical Facts
    
    Probably you have been a member of a jury, listening to
    the testimony about a simple matter of fact, such as an auto-
    mobile accident. Or you may have been on a blue ribbon jury,
    and have had to decide whether one person killed another or
    not. If you have done either, you know how difficult it is to
    reconstruct the past, even a single event in the past, from the
    memories of persons who actually saw it happen.
  - |-
    A court concerns itself with events that have happened fairly recently and in the presence of living witnesses. In addition, there are stringent rules of evidence. A witness cannot suppose anything, he cannot guess or hypothecate or estimate (except under very carefully controlled conditions). And of course he is not supposed to lie.
    
    With all the careful rules of evidence, and cross-examination besides, have you ever been absolutely sure, as a member of a jury, that you really knew what happened?
    
    The law assumes that you will not be absolutely sure. It assumes that there will always be some doubt in a juror's mind. As a matter of practice, in order that trials may be decided one way or the other, it says that the doubt must be "reasonable" if it is to be allowed to affect your judgment. The doubt must be, in other words, sufficient to trouble your conscience.
    
    A historian is concerned with events that occurred, most of them, a long time ago. All the witnesses to the events are usually dead. What evidence they give is not given in a courtroom—that is, it is not governed by stringent and careful rules. Such witnesses as there are often guess, hypothecate, estimate, assume, and suppose. We cannot see their faces in order to judge whether they are lying (if we ever really can know that about anybody). They are not cross-examined. And there is no guarantee whatever that they know what they are talking about.
    
    If, then, it is difficult to be sure that one knows about the truth of a relatively simple matter, such as is decided by a jury in a court of law, how much more difficult it is to know what really happened in history. A historical fact, though we may have a feeling of trust and solidity about the word, is one of the most elusive things in the world.
  - |-
    Of course, about some kinds of historical fact we can be
    pretty certain. America was involved in a Civil War that began
    with the firing on Fort Sumter, on April 12, 1861, and ended
    with the surrender of General Lee to General Grant at Ap-
    pomattox Court House, on April 9, 1865. Everyone agrees
    about those dates. It is not likely (though it is not totally im-
    possible ) that every American calendar was incorrect at that
    time.
    
    But how much have we learned if we know exactly when
    How to Read History 237
    
    the Civil War started and when it ended? Indeed, those dates
    have been disputed—not on the grounds that the calendars
    were wrong, but that the war really started with the election
    of Lincoln in the fall of 1860 and ended with his assassination
    five days after Lee's surrender. Others have claimed that the
    war started even earlier—as much as five or ten or twenty years
    before 1861—and we know that it was still actually being
    fought in outlying parts of the United States, to which word
    had not yet come of the Northern triumph, as late as May,
    June, and July, 1865. And there are those, too, who feel that
    the Civil War is not over yet, that it will never be over until
    black Americans are completely free and equal, or until the
    South manages to secede from the Union, or until the right of
    the federal government to control all the states is finally estab-
    lished and accepted by every American everywhere.
    
    At least we do know, one might say, that whether or not
    the firing on Fort Sumter started the Civil War, it did occur
    on April 12, 1861. That is true—within the limits of possibility
    we referred to before. But why was Sumter fired on? That is an
    obvious next question. And could war still have been avoided
    after the attack? If it had been, would we care that such and
    such an assault occurred on such and such a spring day more
    than a century ago? If we did not care—and we do not care
    about many attacks on forts that have doubtless occurred, but
    about which we know nothing whatever—would the firing on
    Sumter still be a significant historical fact?
    
    Theories of History
  - |-
    We class history, the story of the past, more often under fiction than under science—if it must be affiliated with one or the other. If not, if history, that is, is allowed to rest somewhere in between the two main divisions of the kinds of books, then it is usually admitted that history is closer to fiction than to science.
    
    238 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    This does not mean that a historian makes up his facts, like a poet or story teller. However, we might get into trouble if we insisted too strongly that a writer of fiction makes up his facts. He creates a world, as we have said. But this new world is not totally different from our own—indeed, it had better not be—and a poet is an ordinary man, with ordinary senses by and through which he has learned. He does not see things that we cannot see (he may see better or in a slightly different way). His characters use words that we use (otherwise we could not believe in them). It is only in dreams that human beings create really strange new worlds—yet even in the most fantastic dream the events and creatures of the imagination are made up out of elements of everyday experience. They are merely put together in strange new ways.
    
    A good historian does not, of course, make up the past. He considers himself responsibly bound by some concept or criterion of accuracy or facts. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that the historian must always make up something. He must either find a general pattern in, or impose one on, events; or he must suppose that he knows why the persons in his story did the things they did. He may have a general theory or philosophy, such as that Providence rules human affairs, and make his history fit that. Or he may abjure any such pattern, imposed as it were from the outside or above, and instead insist that he is merely reporting the real events that have occurred. But in that case he is likely to be forced to assign causes for events and motivations for actions. It is essential to recognize which way the historian you are reading is operating.
  - |-
    The only way to avoid taking either one or the other position is to assume that men do not do things for a purpose, or that the purpose, if it exists, is undiscoverable—in other words, that there is no pattern to history at all.
    
    Tolstoy had such a theory about history. He was not a historian, of course; he was a novelist. But many historians have held the same view, particularly in modern times. The causes of every human action, Tolstoy thought, were so manifold, so complex, and so deeply hidden in unconscious motivations that it is impossible to know why anything ever happened.
    
    Because theories of history differ, and because a historian's theory affects his account of events, it is necessary to read more than one account of the history of an event or period if we want to understand it. Indeed, this is the first rule of reading history. And it is all the more important if the event in which we are interested has practical significance for us. It is probably of practical significance to all Americans that they know something about the history of the Civil War. We still live in the backwash of that great and sorry conflict; we live in a world it helped to make. But we cannot hope to understand it if we look at it through the eyes of only one man, or one side, or one faction of modern academic historians. The other day we opened a new Civil War history and noted that its author offered it as "an impartial, objective history of the Civil War from the point of view of the South." The author appeared to be serious. Maybe he was; maybe such a thing is possible. At any rate, we would admit that every narrative history has to be written from some point of view. But to get at the truth, we ought to look at it from more than one viewpoint.
    
    The Universal in History
  - |-
    We are not always able to read more than one history of an event. When we are not, we must admit that we do not have much chance of learning the truth of the matter in question—of learning what really happened. However, that is not the only reason to read history. It might be claimed that only the professional historian, the man who is writing a history himself, is required to cross-examine his sources by exhaustively checking one against the other. He must leave no stone unturned if he is to know what he ought to know about his subject. We, as lay readers of history, stand somewhere between the professional historian, on the one hand, and the irresponsible amateur, on the other hand, who reads history only for amusement.
    
    Let us take the example of Thucydides. You may be aware that he wrote the only major contemporary history of the Peloponnesian War at the end of the fifth century B.C. In a sense, there is nothing to check his work against. What, then, can we expect to learn from it?
    
    Greece is now a tiny country; a war that occurred there twenty-five centuries ago can have little real effect on our life today. Everyone who fought in it is long dead, and the specific things for which they fought are long dead, too. The victories are now meaningless, and the defeats without pain. The cities that were taken and lost have crumbled into dust. Indeed, if we stop to think of it, almost all that remains of the Peloponnesian War is Thucydides' account of it.

    Yet that account is still important. For Thucydides' story—we might as well use that word—has had an influence on the subsequent history of man. Leaders in later eras read Thucydi-des. When they found themselves in situations that even faintly approximated that of the tragically divided Greek city-states, they compared their own position to that of Athens or Sparta. They used Thucydides as an excuse and a justification, and even as a pattern of conduct. The result was that by ever so little, perhaps, but perceptibly, the history of the world was changed by the view held of a small portion of it by Thucydides in the fifth century B.C. Thus we read Thucydides not because he described perfectly what happened before he wrote his book, but because he to a certain extent determined what happened after. And we read him, strange as this may seem, to know what is happening now.
    
    "Poetry is more philosophical than history," wrote Aristotle. By this he meant that poetry is more general, more universal.
    A good poem is true not only in its own time and place, but in all times and places. It has meaning and force for all men. History is not quite so universal as that. It is tied to events in a way that poetry is not. But any good history is also universal.
    How to Read History 241
    
    Thucydides himself said that he was writing his history so
    that men of the future would not have to repeat the mistakes
    he had seen made and from which he had suffered personally
    and through the agony of his country. He described the kinds
    of human mistakes that would have meaning to men other than
    himself, to men other than Greeks. Yet some of the very same
    errors that the Athenians and the Spartans made 2,500 years
    ago, or at least very similar ones, are being made now, as they
    have been made over and over again since Thucydides' time.

    If your view of history is limited, if you go to it to discover only what really happened, you will not learn the main thing that Thucydides, or indeed any good historian, has to teach. If you read Thucydides well, you may even decide to give up trying to discover what really happened in the past.
    
    History is the story of what led up to now. It is the present that interests us—that and the future. The future will be partly determined by the present. Thus, you can learn something about the future, too, from a historian, even from one who like Thucydides lived more than two thousand years ago.
    
    Let us sum up these two suggestions for reading history.
    The first is: if you can, read more than one history of an event or period that interests you. The second is: read a history not only to learn what really happened at a particular time and place in the past, but also to learn the way men act in all times and places, especially now.
    
    Questions to Ask of a Historical Book
    
    Despite the fact that most histories are closer to fiction than to science, they can be read as expository works, and therefore they should be. Hence, we must ask the same questions of a historical book that we ask of any expository book. Because of the special nature of history, we must ask those questions a little differently and must expect to receive slightly different kinds of answers.
  - |-
    As far as the first question is concerned, every history has a particular and limited subject. It is surprising, then, how often readers do not trouble to find out what this is. In particular, they do not always note carefully what limitations the author sets for himself. A history of the Civil War is not a history of the world in the nineteenth century. It probably will not be a history of the American West in the 1860's. It could, though perhaps it should not, ignore the state of American education in that decade, or the movement of the American frontier, or the progress of American freedom. Hence, if we are to read a history well, it is necessary to know precisely what it is about and what it is not about. Certainly, if we are to criticize it, we must know the latter. An author cannot be blamed for not doing what he did not try to do.
    
    With regard to the second question, the historian tells a story, and that story, of course, occurred in time. Its general outlines are thus determined, and we do not have to search for them. But there is more than one way to tell a story, and we must know how the historian has chosen to tell his. Does he divide his work into chapters that correspond to years or decades or generations? Or does he divide it according to other rubrics of his own choosing? Does he discuss, in one chapter, the economic history of his period, and cover its wars and religious movements and literary productions in others? Which of these is most important to him? If we discover that, if we can say which aspect of the story he is telling seems to him most fundamental, we can understand him better. We may not agree with his judgment about what is basic, but we can still learn from him.
  - |-
    Criticism of history takes two forms. We can judge—but only, as always, after we understand what is being said—that a historian's work lacks verisimilitude. People just do not act that way, we may feel. Even if the historian documents his statements by giving us access to his sources, and even if to our knowledge they are relevant, we can still feel that he has misunderstood them, that he has judged them in the wrong way, perhaps through some deficiency in his grasp of human nature or human affairs. We tend to feel this, for example, about many older historians who do not include much discussion of economic matters in their work. People, we may be inclined to think now, act out of self-interest; too much nobility ascribed to the "hero" of a history may make us suspicious.
    
    On the other hand, we may think, especially if we have some special knowledge of the subject, that the historian has misused his sources. We may be indignant to discover that he has not read a certain book that we have read. And he may be misinformed about the facts of the matter. In that case, he cannot have written a good history of it. We expect a historian to be informed.
    
    The first criticism is, however, more important. A good historian must combine the talents of the storyteller and the scientist. He must know what is likely to have happened as well as what some witnesses or writers said actually did happen.
  - |-
    Regarding the last question, "What of it?", it is possible that no kind of literature has a greater effect on the actions of men than history. Satires and pictures of philosophical utopias have little effect; we would all like the world to be better, but we are seldom inspired by the recommendations of authors who do no more than describe, often bitterly, the difference between the real and the ideal. History, which tells us of the actions of men of the past, often does lead us to make changes, to try to better our lot. In general, statesmen have been more learned in history than in other disciplines. History suggests the possible, for it describes things that have already been done. If they have been done, perhaps they can be done again—or perhaps they can be avoided.
    
    The main answer to the question, "What of it?", therefore, lies in the direction of practical, political action. For this reason it is of great importance that history be read well. Unfortunately, leaders have often acted with some knowledge of history but not enough. With the world as small and dangerous as it has become, it would be a good idea for all of us to start reading history better.
    
    How to Read Biography and Autobiography
    
    A biography is a story about a real person. This mixed patrimony causes it to have a mixed character.
    
    Some biographers would object to this description. But ordinarily, at least, a biography is a narrative account of the life, the history, of a man or woman or of a group of people; thus, a biography poses many of the same problems as a history. The reader must ask the same sort of questions—what is the author's purpose? What are his criteria of truth?—as well, of course, as asking the questions we must ask of any book.
  - |-
    There are several kinds of biographies. The definitive biography is intended to be the final, exhaustive, scholarly work on the life of someone important enough to deserve a definitive biography. Definitive biographies cannot be written about living persons. They are seldom written until several non-definitive biographies have first appeared, all of them often somewhat inadequate. All sources are gone through, all letters read, and a great deal of contemporary history examined by the author. Since the ability to gather the materials is somewhat different from the talent for shaping them into a good book, definitive biographies are not always easy reading. This is too bad. A scholarly book does not have to be dull. One of the greatest of all biographies is Boswell's Life of Johnson, and it is continuously fascinating. It is certainly definitive (though other biographies of Dr. Johnson have since appeared ), but it is also uniquely interesting.
    
    A definitive biography is a slice of history—the history of a man and of his times, as seen through his eyes. It should be read as history. An authorized biography is not the same thing at all. Such works are usually commissioned by the heirs or friends of some important person, and they are carefully written so that the errors the person made and the triumphs he achieved are seen in the best light possible. They can sometimes be very good indeed, because the author has the advantage—not as a rule accorded to other writers—of being allowed access to all pertinent material by those who control it. But, of course, an authorized biography cannot be trusted in the same way that a definitive biography can be. Instead of reading it simply as history, the reader should understand that it may be biased—that this is the way the reader is expected to think of the book's subject; this is the way his friends and associates want him to be known to the world.
  - |-
    The authorized biography is a kind of history, but it is  
    history with a difference. We may be curious to know what  
    interested persons want the public to know about someone's  
    private life, but we should not expect to know what the private  
    life really was. The reading of an authorized biography will  
    thus often tell us much about the time in which it was written,  
    about its customs and manners, about those actions and atti-  
    tudes that were acceptable—and, by implication and with a  
    little extrapolation, about those that were not. But we should  
    not hope to discover the real life of a human being any more  
    than we would hope to know the real story of a war if we read  
    the communiqueés of only one side. To get at the truth we must  
    read all the communiqués, ask people who were there, and use  
    our own minds to make sense out of the muddle. A definitive  
    biography has already done this work; in the case of an autho-  
    rized biography (and most biographies of living persons are of  
    this sort), there is still much to do.
    
    There remain those biographies that are neither definitive  
    nor authorized. Perhaps we may call them ordinary biogra-  
    phies. In such works, we expect the author to be accurate, to  
    know his facts. We want above all to be given the feeling that  
    we are viewing the life of a real person in another time and  
    
    place. Human beings are curious, and especially curious about  
    other human beings.
    
    246 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    Such books, although not trustworthy in the way definitive  
    biographies are, are often very good reading. The world would  
    be the poorer without Izaak Walton's Lives of his friends, the  
    poets John Donne and George Herbert, for example (Walton  
    is of course better known for his The Compleat Angler); or  
    John Tyndall's account of his friend Michael Faraday in Fara-  
    day the Discoverer.
  - |-
    Some biographies are didactic. They have a moral purpose. Not many of this sort are written any more, but they used to be common. (They are still written for children, of course.) Plutarch's Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans is such a work. Plutarch told the stories of great men of the Greek and Roman past in order to help his contemporaries to be great also, and to help them avoid the errors into which the great so often fall—or so he felt. The Lives is a marvelous book; but, although many of the accounts are the only ones we have of their subjects, we do not read it so much for its biographical information as for its view of life in general. Its subjects are interesting people, good and bad, but never indifferent. Plutarch realized this himself. His original intention in writing had been to instruct others, he said, but in the course of the work he discovered that more and more it was he himself who was deriving profit and stimulation from "lodging these men one after the other in his house."
    
    Incidentally, Plutarch's is another historical work that has exercised a profound influence on subsequent history. For example, just as Plutarch shows Alexander the Great modeling his own life on that of Achilles (whose life he learned about from Homer), so many later conquerors have tried to model their lives on that of Plutarch's Alexander.
    
    Autobiographies present some different and interesting problems. First of all, it is questionable whether anyone has ever written a true autobiography. If it is difficult to know the life of anyone else, it is even more difficult to know one's own. And, of course, all autobiographies have to be written about lives that are not yet complete.
    
    How to Read History 247
  - |-
    The temptation to tell either less or more than the truth
    (the latter may be more common), when there is no one to
    contradict you, is almost irresistible. Everybody has some
    secrets he cannot bear to divulge; everybody also has some
    illusions about himself, which it is almost impossible for him
    to regard as illusions. However, although it is not possible to
    write a wholly true autobiography, neither is it possible to
    write one that contains no truth at all. Just as no man can be a
    perfect liar, so every autobiography tells us something about
    its author, if only that there are things that he wants to conceal.
    
    It is customary to say that the Confessions of Rousseau, or
    some other book written about the same time (about the
    middle of the eighteenth century), is the first real autobiography.
    This is to overlook Augustine's Confessions, for example,
    and Montaigne's Essays; but the error is more serious than that.
    In fact, much of what anyone writes on any subject is auto-
    biographical. There is a great deal of Plato in the Republic, of
    Milton in Paradise Lost, of Goethe in Faust—though we may
    not be able to put our finger on it exactly. If we are interested
    in humanity, we will tend, within reasonable limits, to read
    any book partly with an eye to discovering the character of its
    author.
    
    This should never be the primary consideration, and it
    leads, when it is overdone, to the so-called pathetic fallacy.
    But we should remember that words do not write themselves
    —the ones we read have been found and written down by a
    living man. Plato and Aristotle said some similar, and some
    dissimilar, things; but even if they had agreed completely, they
    could not have written the same books, for they were different
    men. We may even discover something of St. Thomas Aquinas
    in such an apparently unrevealing work as the Summa Theo-
    logica.
    
    Thus it matters very little that formal autobiography is a
    relatively new literary genre. No one has ever been able to
    keep himself entirely out of his book. "I have no more made
    my book," said Montaigne, "than my book has made me; a
    book co-substantial with its author, concerned with my own

    "self, an integral part of my life." And he added, "Everyone recognizes me in my book, and my book in me." This is true, and not only of Montaigne. "This is no book," says Whitman of his Leaves of Grass. "Who touches this touches a man."
    
    Are there any additional hints for reading biographies and autobiographies? Here is one that is important. Despite the fact that such books, and especially the autobiographies, reveal much about their authors, we should not spend so much time trying to discover a writer's secrets that we do not find out what he says plainly. Apart from this, given the fact that such books are often more poetical than discursive or philosophical, and that they are special kinds of history, there is perhaps little more to add. You should remember, of course, that if you wish to know the truth about a person's life, you should read as many biographies of him as you can find, including his own account of his life, if he wrote one. Read biography as history and as the cause of history; take all autobiographies with a grain of salt; and never forget that you must not argue with a book until you fully understand what it is saying. As to the question, What of it?, we would only say this: biography, like history, can be a cause of practical, moral action. A biography can be inspiring. It is the story of a life, usually a more or less successful one—and we too have lives to lead.
    
    How to Read About Current Events
    
    We have said that our exposition of the art of analytical reading applies to everything you have to read, not just to books. Now we want to qualify that statement a little. Analytical reading is not always necessary. There are many things that we read that do not require the kind of effort and skill that is called for at this third level of reading ability. Nevertheless, although the rules of reading do not all always have to be applied, the four questions must always be asked of anything
  - |-
    You read. That means, of course, that they must be asked when  
    you are faced with the kind of things to which most of us  
    devote much of our reading time: newspapers, magazines,  
    books about current events, and the like.
    
    After all, history did not stop a thousand years ago, or a  
    hundred. The world goes on, and men and women continue to  
    write about what is happening and how things are changing.  
    Perhaps no modern history is as great as Thucydides' work;  
    posterity will have to be the judge of that. But we do have an  
    obligation, as human beings and as citizens, to try to under-  
    stand the world around us.
    
    The problem comes down to knowing what is actually  
    happening now. We have chosen the word "actually" in the  
    last sentence intentionally. The French word for newsreel is  
    actualités; the whole concept of current events literature is  
    somehow the same as that of the "news." How do we get the  
    news, and how do we know that what we get is true?
    
    You can see at once that we are faced with the same prob-  
    lem that is posed by history itself. We cannot be sure that we  
    are getting at the facts—we cannot be sure that we know what  
    is happening now any more than we can be sure about what  
    happened in the past. And yet we must try to know, so far as  
    that is possible.
    
    If we could be everywhere at once, overhear all conversa-  
    tions on earth, look into the heart of every living person, we  
    might be able to make a stab at the truth of current events.  
    Being human and hence limited, we must fall back on the  
    services of reporters. Reporters are persons who are supposed  
    to know what is happening in a small area. They report it in  
    newspaper stories, in magazines, or in books. What we can  
    know depends on them.
    
    Ideally, a reporter, of whatever kind, is a clear glass in  
    which reality is reflected—or through which it shines, But the  
    human mind is not a clear glass. It is not a good reflector, and  
    when reality shines through it, the mind is not a very good  
    filter. It separates out what it considers to be unreality, un-
  - |-

    truth. That is proper, of course; a reporter should not report
    what he thinks is false. But he may be mistaken.
    
    Thus the most important thing to know, when reading
    any report of current happenings, is who is writing the report.
    What is involved here is not so much an acquaintance with the
    reporter himself as with the kind of mind he has. The various
    sorts of filter-reporters fall into groups. To understand what
    kind of filter our reporter's mind is, we must ask a series of
    questions about it. This amounts to asking a series of questions
    about any material dealing with current events. The questions
    are these:
    
    1. What does the author want to prove?
    
    2. Whom does he want to convince?
    
    3. What special knowledge does he assume?
    
    4. What special language does he use?
    
    5. Does he really know what he is talking about?
    
    For the most part it is safe to assume that all current
    events books want to prove something. Often it is easy enough
    to discover what this is. The blurb often states the main con-
    tention or thesis of such books. If it does not appear there, it
    may be stated by the author in a preface.
    
    Having asked what the book is trying to prove, you should
    next ask whom the author is trying to convince. Is the book
    intended for those "in the know'—and are you in that category?
    Is it for that small group of persons who can do something, and
    quickly, about the situation the author describes? Or is it for
    everyone? If you do not belong to the audience for which the
    book is intended, you may not want to read it.
    
    You must next discover what special knowledge the
    author assumes that you have. The word "knowledge" is in-
    tended here to cover a lot of ground. "Opinion" or "prejudice"
    might have been a better choice. Many authors write only for
    readers who agree with them. If you disagree sharply with a
    reporter's assumptions, you may only be irritated if you try to
    
    read his book.
    How to Read History 251
    
    The assumptions that an author makes, and that he
    assumes you share, are sometimes very difficult to discover.
    In The Seventeenth Century Background, Basil Willey has
    this to say:
  - |-
    It is almost insuperably difficult to become critically conscious of one's own habitual assumptions; "doctrines felt as facts" can only be seen to be doctrines, and not facts, after great efforts of thought, and usually only with the aid of a first-rate metaphysician.
    
    He goes on to suggest that it is easier to discover the "doctrines felt as facts" of an age different from our own, and that is what he attempts to do in his book. In reading books about our own time, however, we do not have the advantage of distance. Thus we must try to see through the filter not only of the author-reporter's mind, but also of our own.
    
    Next, you must ask if there is a special language that the author uses. This is particularly important in reading magazines and newspapers, but it also applies to all books about current history. Certain words provoke special responses from us, responses that they might not provoke from other readers a century hence. An example of such a word is "Communism" or "Communist." We should try to control these responses, or at least know when they occur.
    
    Finally, you must consider the last of the five questions, which is probably the hardest to answer. Does the reporter whose work you are reading himself know the facts? Is he privy to the perhaps secret thoughts and decisions of the persons about whom he is writing? Does he know all that he should know in order to give a fair and balanced account of the situation?
    
    What we are suggesting, in other words, is that the possible bias of the author-reporter is not the only thing that has to be considered. We have heard a good deal lately about the "management of the news"; it is important to realize that this applies not only to us, as members of the public, but also to reporters who are supposed to be "in the know." They may not necessarily know all the facts, and they may not always report them accurately.
  - |-
    Be. With the best good will in the world, with every intention of providing us with the truth of the matter, a reporter may still be "uninformed" with regard to secret actions, treaties, and so forth. He himself may be aware of this, or he may not. In the latter case, of course, the situation is especially perilous for his reader.
    
    You will note that these five questions are really only variations on the questions we have said you must ask of any expository book. Knowing an author's special language, for example, is nothing more than coming to terms with him. But because current books and other material about the contemporary world pose special problems for us as readers, we have stated the questions in a different way.
    
    Perhaps it is most useful to sum up the difference in a warning rather than a set of rules for reading books of this kind. The warning is this: Caveat lector—"Let the reader beware." Readers do not have to be wary when reading Aristotle, or Dante, or Shakespeare. But the author of any contemporary book may have—though he does not necessarily have—an interest in your understanding it in a certain way. Or if he does not, the sources of his information may have such an interest. You should know that interest, and take it into account in whatever you read.
    
    A Note on Digests
    
    There is another consequence of our basic distinction—the distinction between reading for information and reading for understanding—that underlies everything we have said about reading. And this is that sometimes we have to read for information about understanding—to find out how others have interpreted the facts. Let us try to explain what this means.
    
    For the most part, we read newspapers and magazines, and even advertising matter, for the information they contain. The amount of such material is vast, so vast that no one today

    has time to read more than a small fraction of it. Necessity has
    been the mother of a number of good inventions in the field
    of such reading. The news magazines, for instance, such as Time
    and Newsweek, perform an invaluable function for most of us
    by reading the news and reducing it to its essential elements
    of information. The men who write these magazines are pri-
    marily readers. They have developed the art of reading for
    information to a point far beyond the average reader's compe-
    tence.
    
    The same is true of a publication like Reader's Digest,
    which professes to bring us in condensed form much that is
    worth our attention in current general magazines to the com-
    pact scope of a single, small volume. Of course, the very best
    articles, like the best books, cannot be condensed without loss.
    If the essays of Montaigne, for example, were appearing in a
    current periodical, we would scarcely be satisfied to read a
    digest of them. A summary, in this case, would function well
    only if it impelled us to read the original. For the average
    article, however, a condensation is usually adequate, and often
    even better than the original, because the average article is
    mainly informational. The skill that produces Reader's Digest
    and the scores of similar periodicals is, first of all, a skill in
    reading, and only then one of writing simply and clearly. It
    does for us what few of us have the technique—even if we had
    the time—to do for ourselves. It cuts the core of solid informa-
    tion out of pages and pages of less substantial stuff.
    
    But, after all, we still have to read the periodicals that
    accomplish these digests of current news and information. If
    we wish to be informed, we cannot avoid the task of reading,
    no matter how good the digests are. And the task of reading
    them is, in the last analysis, the same task as that which is per-
    formed by the editors of these magazines on the original
    material that they make available in more compact form. They
    have saved us labor, so far as the extent of our reading is con-
    cerned, but they have not saved us and cannot entirely save us
    the trouble of reading. In a sense, the function they perform
  - |-

    profits us only if we can read their digests of information as
    well as they have done the prior reading in order to give us
    the digests.
    
    And that involves reading for understanding as well as
    information. Obviously, the more condensed a digest is, the
    more selection has occurred. We may not have to worry about
    this very much if 1,000 pages are cut down to 900, say; but if
    1,000 pages are cut to ten, or even one, then the question of
    what has been left out becomes critical. Hence the greater
    the condensation, the more important it is that we know some-
    thing of the character of the condensor; the same caveat we
    mentioned before applies here with even greater force. Ulti-
    mately, perhaps, this comes down to reading between the lines
    of an expert condensation. You cannot refer to the original to
    find out what was left out; you must somehow infer this from
    the condensation itself. Reading digests, therefore, is some-
    times the most demanding and difficult reading that you can
    do.

    HOW TO READ
    SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS
    
    The title of this chapter may be misleading. We do not propose
    to give you advice about how to read every kind of science and
    mathematics. We will confine ourselves to discussing only two
    kinds: the great scientific and mathematical classics of our
    tradition, on the one hand, and modern scientific populariza-
    tions, on the other hand. What we say will often be applicable
    to the reading of specialized monographs on abstruse and
    limited subjects, but we cannot help you to read those. There
    are two reasons for this. One is, simply, that we are not quali-
    fied to do it.

    The other is this. Until approximately the end of the nineteenth century, the major scientific books were written for a lay audience. Their authors—men like Galileo, and Newton, and Darwin—were not averse to being read by specialists in their fields; indeed, they wanted to reach such readers. But there was as yet no institutionalized specialization in those days, days which Albert Einstein called "the happy childhood of science." Intelligent and well-read persons were expected to read scientific books as well as history and philosophy; there were no hard and fast distinctions, no boundaries that could not be crossed. There was also none of the disregard for the general or lay reader that is manifest in contemporary scientific writing. Most modern scientists do not care what lay readers think, and so they do not even try to reach them.
    
    Today, science tends to be written by experts for experts. A serious communication on a scientific subject assumes so much specialized knowledge on the part of the reader that it usually cannot be read at all by anyone not learned in the field. There are obvious advantages to this approach, not least that it serves to advance science more quickly. Experts talking to each other about their expertise can arrive very quickly at the frontiers of it—they can see the problems at once and begin to try to solve them. But the cost is equally obvious. You—the ordinary intelligent reader whom we are addressing in this book—are left quite out of the picture.
    
    In fact, this situation, although it is more extreme in science than elsewhere, obtains in many other fields as well. Nowadays, philosophers seldom write for anyone except other philosophers; economists write for economists; and even historians are beginning to find that the kind of shorthand, monographic communication to other experts that has long been dominant in science is a more convenient way of getting ideas across than the more traditional narrative work written for everyone.
    
    What does the general reader do in these circumstances? He cannot become expert in all fields. He must fall back, therefore, on scientific popularizations. Some of these are good, and some are bad. But it is not only important to know the difference; it is also important to be able to read the good ones with understanding.

    Understanding the Scientific Enterprise
    
    One of the fastest growing academic disciplines is the
    history of science. We have seen marked changes in this area
    within the past few years. It was not so long ago that "serious"
    scientists looked down upon historians of science. The latter
    were thought of as men who studied the history of a subject
    because they were not capable of expanding its frontiers. The
    attitude of scientists to historians of science could be summed
    up in that famous remark of George Bernard Shaw's: "Those
    who can, do; those who can't, teach."
    
    Expressions of this attitude are seldom heard nowadays.
    Departments of the history of science have become respectable,
    and excellent scientists study and write about the history of
    their subject. An example is what has been called the "Newton
    industry." At the present time, intensive and extensive re-
    search is being undertaken in many countries on the work and
    strange personality of Sir Isaac Newton. Half a dozen books
    have been recently published or announced. The reason is that
    scientists are more concerned than ever before about the na-
    ture of the scientific enterprise itself.
    
    Thus we have no hesitation in recommending that you try
    to read at least some of the great scientific classics of our tra-
    dition. In fact, there is really no excuse for not trying to read
    them. None of them is impossibly difficult, not even a book like
    Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, if
    you are willing to make the effort.
    
    The most helpful advice we can give you is this. You are
    required by one of the rules for reading expository works to
    state, as clearly as you can, the problem that the author has
    tried to solve. This rule of analytical reading is relevant to all
    expository works, but it is particularly relevant to works in the
    fields of science and mathematics.
  - |-
    There is another way of saying this. As a layman, you do not read the classical scientific books to become knowledgeable in their subject matters in a contemporary sense. Instead, you read them to understand the history and philosophy of science. That, indeed, is the layman's responsibility with regard to science. The major way in which you can discharge it is to become aware of the problems that the great scientists were trying to solve—aware of the problems, and aware, also, of the background of the problems.
    
    258 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    To follow the strands of scientific development, to trace the ways in which facts, assumptions, principles, and proofs are interrelated, is to engage in the activity of the human reason where it has probably operated with the most success. That is enough by itself, perhaps, to justify the historical study of science. In addition, such study will serve to dispel, in some measure, the apparent unintelligibility of science. Most important of all, it is an activity of the mind that is essential to education, the central aim of which has always been recognized, from Socrates' day down to our own, as the freeing of the mind through the discipline of wonder.
    
    Suggestions for Reading Classical Scientific Books
    
    By a scientific book, we mean the report of findings or conclusions in some field of research, whether carried on experimentally in a laboratory or by observations of nature in the raw. The scientific problem is always to describe the phenomena as accurately as possible, and to trace the interconnections between different kinds of phenomena.
    
    In the great works of science, there is no oratory or propaganda, though there may be bias in the sense of initial presuppositions. You detect this, and take account of it, by distinguishing what the author assumes from what he establishes through argument. The more "objective" a scientific author is, the more he will explicitly ask you to take this or that for granted. Scientific objectivity is not the absence of initial bias. It is attained by frank confession of it.
  - |-
    The leading terms in a scientific work are usually ex-
    pressed by uncommon or technical words. They are relatively
    easy to spot, and through them you can readily grasp the
    propositions. The main propositions are always general ones.
    Science thus is not chronotopic. Just the opposite; a scientist,
    unlike a historian, tries to get away from locality in time and
    place. He tries to say how things are generally, how things
    generally behave.
    
    How to Read Science and Mathematics 259
    
    There are likely to be two main difficulties in reading a
    scientific book. One is with respect to the arguments. Science
    is primarily inductive; that is, its primary arguments are those
    that establish a general proposition by reference to observable
    evidence—a single case created by an experiment, or a vast
    array of cases collected by patient investigation. There are
    other arguments, of the sort that are called deductive. These
    are arguments in which a proposition is proved by other propo-
    sitions already somehow established. So far as proof is con-
    cemed, science does not differ much from philosophy. But the
    inductive argument is characteristic of science.
    
    This first difficulty arises because, in order to understand
    the inductive arguments in a scientific book, you must be able
    to follow the evidence that the scientist reports as their basis.
    Unfortunately, this is not always possible with nothing but
    the book in hand. If the book itself fails to enlighten him, the
    reader has only one recourse, which is to get the necessary
    special experience for himself at first hand. He may have to
    witness a laboratory demonstration. He may have to look at
    and handle pieces of apparatus similar to those referred to in
    the book. He may have to go to a museum and observe speci-
    mens or models.
    
    Anyone who desires to acquire an understanding of the
    history of science must not only read the classical texts, but
    must also become acquainted, through direct experience, with
    the crucial experiments in that history. There are classical ex-
    periments as well as classical books. The scientific classics be-
    come more intelligible to those who have seen with their own
    eyes and done with their own hands what a great scientist de-
    scribes as the procedure by which he reached his insights.
  - |-
    This does not mean that you cannot make a start without going through all the steps described. Take a book like Lavoisier's Elements of Chemistry, for instance. Published in 1789, the work is no longer considered to be useful as a textbook in chemistry, and indeed a student would be unwise to study it for the purpose of passing even a high school examination in the subject. Nevertheless, its method was revolutionary at the time, and its conception of a chemical element is still, on the whole, the one that we have in modern times. Now the point is that you do not have to read the book through, and in detail, to receive these impressions of it. The Preface, for example, with its emphasis on the importance of method in science, is enlightening. "Every branch of physical science," wrote Lavoisier,
    
    must consist of three things: the series of facts which are the objects of the science, the ideas which represent these facts, and the words by which these facts are expressed. . . . And, as ideas are preserved and communicated by means of words, it necessarily follows that we cannot improve the language of any science without at the same time improving the science itself; neither can we, on the other hand, improve a science without improving the language or nomenclature which belongs to it.
    
    This was exactly what Lavoisier did. He improved chemistry by improving its language, just as Newton, a century before, had improved physics by systematizing and ordering its language—in the process, as you may recall, developing the differential and integral calculus.
    
    Mention of the calculus leads us to consider the second main difficulty in reading scientific books. And that is the problem of mathematics.
  - |-
    Many people are frightened of mathematics and think they cannot read it at all. No one is quite sure why this is so. Some psychologists think there is such a thing as "symbol blindness"—the inability to set aside one's dependence on the concrete and to follow the controlled shifting of symbols. There may be something to this, except, of course, that words shift, too, and their shifts, being more or less uncontrolled, are perhaps even more difficult to follow. Others believe that the trouble lies in the teaching of mathematics. If so, we can be gratified that much recent research has been devoted to the question of how to teach it better.
    
    The problem is partly this. We are not told, or not told early enough so that it sinks in, that mathematics is a language, and that we can learn it like any other, including our own. We have to learn our own language twice, first when we learn to speak it, second when we learn to read it. Fortunately, mathematics has to be learned only once, since it is almost wholly a written language.
    
    As we have already observed, learning a new written language always involves us in problems of elementary reading. When we underwent our initial reading instruction in elementary school, our problem was to learn to recognize certain arbitrary symbols when they appeared on a page, and to memorize certain relations among these symbols. Even the best readers continue to read, at least occasionally, at the elementary level: for example, whenever we come upon a word that we do not know and have to look up in the dictionary. If we are puzzled by the syntax of a sentence, we are also working at the elementary level. Only when we have solved these problems can we go on to read at higher levels.
    
    Since mathematics is a language, it has its own vocabulary, grammar, and syntax, and these have to be learned by the beginning reader. Certain symbols and relationships between symbols have to be memorized. The problem is different, because the language is different, but it is no more difficult, theoretically, than learning to read English or French or German. At the elementary level, in fact, it may even be easier.

    Any language is a medium of communication among men
    on subjects that the communicants can mutually comprehend.
    The subjects of ordinary discourse are mainly emotional facts
    and relations. Such subjects are not entirely comprehensible
    by any two different persons. But two different persons can
    comprehend a third thing that is outside of and emotionally
    separated from both of them, such as an electrical circuit, an
    262 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    isosceles triangle, or a syllogism. It is mainly when we invest
    these things with emotional connotations that we have trouble
    understanding them. Mathematics allows us to avoid this.
    There are no emotional connotations of mathematical terms,
    propositions, and equations when these are properly used.
    
    We are also not told, at least not early enough, how beauti-
    ful and how intellectually satisfying mathematics can be. It is
    probably not too late for anyone to see this if he will go to a
    little trouble. You might start with Euclid, whose Elements of
    Geometry is one of the most lucid and beautiful works of any
    kind that has ever been written.
    
    Let us consider, for example, the first five propositions in
    Book I of the Elements. (If a copy of the book is available, you
    should look at it.) Propositions in elementary geometry are of
    two kinds: (1) the statement of problems in the construction
    of figures, and (2) theorems about the relations between fig-
    ures or their parts. Construction problems require that some-
    thing be done, theorems require that something be proved. At
    the end of a Euclidean construction problem, you will find the
    letters Q.E.F., which stand for Quod erat faciendum, "(Be-
    ing) what it was required to do." At the end of a Euclidean
    theorem, you will find the letters Q.E.D., which stand for
    Quod erat demonstrandum, "(Being ) what it was required to
    prove."
  - |-
    The first three propositions in Book I of the Elements are  
    all problems of construction. Why is this? One answer is that  
    the constructions are needed in the proofs of the theorems.  
    This is not apparent in the first four propositions, but we can  
    see it in the fifth proposition, which is a theorem. It states that  
    in an isosceles triangle (a triangle with two equal sides) the  
    base angles are equal. This involves the use of Proposition 3,  
    for a shorter line is cut off from a longer line. Since Proposi-  
    tion 3, in turn, depends on the use of the construction in Propo-  
    sition 2, while Proposition 2 involves Proposition 1, we see that  
    these three constructions are needed for the sake of Proposi-  
    tion 5.  
    How to Read Science and Mathematics 263  
    
    Constructions can also be interpreted as serving another  
    purpose. They bear an obvious similarity to postulates; both  
    constructions and postulates assert that geometrical operations  
    can be performed. In the case of the postulates, the possibility  
    is assumed; in the case of the propositions, it is proved. The  
    proof, of course, involves the use of the postulates. Thus, we  
    might wonder, for example, whether there is really any such  
    thing as an equilateral triangle, which is defined in Definition  
    20. Without troubling ourselves here about the thorny question  
    of the existence of mathematical objects, we can at least see  
    that Proposition 1 shows that, from the assumption that there  
    are such things as straight lines and circles, it follows that there  
    are such things as equilateral triangles.
  - |-
    Let us return to Proposition 5, the theorem about the
    equality of the base angles of an isosceles triangle. When the
    conclusion has been reached, in a series of steps involving
    reference to previous propositions and to the postulates, the
    proposition has been proved. It has then been shown that if
    something is true (namely, the hypothesis that we have an
    isosceles triangle), and if some additional things are valid (the
    definitions, postulates, and prior propositions ), then something
    else is also true, namely, the conclusion. The proposition asserts
    this if-then relationship. It does not assert the truth of the
    hypothesis, nor does it assert the truth of the conclusion, except
    when the hypothesis is true. Nor is this connection between
    hypothesis and conclusion seen to be true until the proposition
    is proved. It is precisely the truth of this connection that is
    proved, and nothing else.
    
    Is it an exaggeration to say that this is beautiful? We do
    not think so. What we have here is a really logical exposition
    of a really limited problem. There is something very attractive
    about both the clarity of the exposition and the limited nature
    of the problem. Ordinary discourse, even very good philosoph-
    ical discourse, finds it difficult to limit its problems in this
    way. And the use of logic in the case of philosophical problems
    is hardly ever as clear as this.
    
    264 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    Consider the difference between the argument of Propo-
    sition 5, as outlined here, and even the simplest of syllogisms,
    such as the following:
    
    All animals are mortal;
    All men are animals;
    Therefore, all men are mortal.
  - |-
    There is something satisfying about that, too. We can treat it as though it were a piece of mathematical reasoning. Assuming that there are such things as animals and men, and that animals are mortal, then the conclusion follows with the same certainty as the one about the angles of the triangle. But the trouble is that there really are animals and men; we are assuming something about real things, something that may or may not be true. We have to examine our assumptions in a way that we do not have to do in mathematics. Euclid's proposition does not suffer from this. It does not really matter to him whether there are such things as isosceles triangles. If there are, he is saying, and if they are defined in such and such a way, then it follows absolutely that their base angles are equal. There can be no doubt about this whatever—now and forever.
    
    Handling the Mathematics in Scientific Books
    
    This digression on Euclid has led us a little out of our way. We were observing that the presence of mathematics in scientific books is one of the main obstacles to reading them. There are a couple of things to say about that.
    
    First, you can probably read at least elementary mathematics better than you think. We have already suggested that you should begin with Euclid, and we are confident that if you spent several evenings with the Elements you would overcome much of your fear of the subject. Having done some work on Euclid, you might proceed to glance at the works of other classical Greek mathematicians—Archimedes, Apollonius, Nicomachus. They are not really very difficult, and besides, you can skip.
    
    That leads to the second point we want to make. If your intention is to read a mathematical book in and for itself, you must read it, of course, from beginning to end—and with a pencil in your hand, for writing in the margins and even on a scratch pad is more necessary here than in the case of any other kinds of books. But your intention may not be that, but instead to read a scientific work that has mathematics in it. In this case, skipping is often the better part of valor.

    Take Newton's Principia for an example. The book contains many propositions, both construction problems and theorems, but it is not necessary to read all of them in detail, especially the first time through. Read the statement of the proposition, and glance down the proof to get an idea of how it is done; read the statements of the so-called lemmas and corollaries; and read the so-called scholiums, which are essentially discussions of the relations between propositions and of their relations to the work as a whole. You will begin to see the whole if you do this, and so to discover how the system that Newton is constructing is built—what comes first and what second, and how the parts fit together. Go through the whole work in this way, avoiding the diagrams if they trouble you (as they do many readers), merely glancing at much of the interstitial matter, but being sure to find and read the passages where Newton is making his main points. One of these comes at the very end of the work, at the close of Book III, which is titled "The System of the World." This General Scholium, as Newton called it, not only sums up what has gone before but also states the great problem of almost all subsequent physics.
    
    Newton's Optics is another scientific classic that you might want to try to read. There is actually very little mathematics in it, although at first glance that does not appear to be so because the pages are sprinkled with diagrams. But these diagrams

    grams are merely illustrations describing Newton's experiments
    with holes for the sun to shine through into a dark room, with
    prisms to intercept the sunbeam, and with pieces of white
    paper placed so that the various colors of the beam can shine
    on them. You can quite easily repeat some of these experiments
    yourself, and this is fun to do, for the colors are beautiful, and
    the descriptions are eminently clear. You will want to read, in
    addition to the descriptions of the experiments, the statements
    of the various theorems or propositions, and the discussions
    that occur at the end of each of the three Books, where Newton
    sums up his discoveries and suggests their consequences. The
    end of Book III is famous, for it contains some statements by
    Newton about the scientific enterprise itself that are well worth
    reading.
    
    Mathematics is very often employed by scientific writers,
    mainly because it has the qualities of preciseness, clarity, and
    limitedness that we have described. Usually you can under-
    stand something of the matter without going very deeply into
    the mathematics, as in the case of Newton. Oddly enough, how-
    ever, even if mathematics is absolutely terrifying to you, its
    absence from certain works may cause you even more trouble.
    A case in point is Galileo's Two New Sciences, his famous
    treatise on the strength of materials and on motion. This work
    is particularly difficult for modern readers because it is not
    primarily mathematical; instead, it is presented in the form of
    a dialogue. The dialogue form, though appropriate to the stage
    and useful in philosophy when employed by such a master as
    Plato, is not really appropriate to science. It is therefore hard
    to discover what Galileo is saying, although when you do you
    will discover that he is stating some revolutionary things.
    
    Not all of the scientific classics, of course, employ mathe-
    matics or even need to employ it. The works of Hippocrates,
    the founder of Greek medicine, are not mathematical. You
    might well read them to discover Hippocrates' view of medi-
    cine—namely, that it is the art of keeping people well, rather
    than that of curing them when they are sick. That is unfortu-
    nate.
  - |-
    nately an uncommon idea nowadays. Nor is William Harvey's
    discourse on the circulation of the blood mathematical, or Wil-
    liam Gilbert's book on magnets. They can be read without too
    much difficulty if you always keep in mind that your primary
    obligation is not to become competent in the subject matter but
    instead to understand the problem.
    
    A Note on Popular Science
    
    In a sense, there is little more to say about reading scien-
    tific popularizations. By definition, these are works—either
    books or articles—written for a wide audience, not just for
    specialists. Thus, if you have managed to read some of the
    classics of the scientific tradition, you should not have much
    trouble with them. This is because, although they are about
    science, they generally skirt or avoid the two main problems
    that confront the reader of an original contribution in science.
    First, they contain relatively few descriptions of experiments
    (instead, they merely report the results of experiments). Sec-
    ond, they contain relatively little mathematics (unless they
    are popular books about mathematics itself).
    
    Popular scientific articles are usually easier to read than
    popular scientific books, although not always. Sometimes such
    articles are very good—for example, articles found in Scientific
    American, a monthly magazine, or Science, a somewhat more
    technical weekly publication. Of course, these publications, no
    matter how good they are or how carefully and responsibly
    edited, pose the problem that was discussed at the end of the
    last chapter. In reading them, we are at the mercy of reporters
    who filter the information for us. If they are good reporters,
    we are fortunate. If they are not, we have almost no recourse.
    
    Scientific popularizations are never easy reading in the
    sense that a story is or seems to be. Even a three-page article
    on DNA containing no reports of experiments and no diagrams
    or mathematical formulas demands considerable effort on the
    reading.
  - |-
    Part of the reader. You cannot read it for understanding without keeping your mind awake. Thus, the requirement that you read actively is more important here than almost anywhere else. Identify the subject matter. Discover the relation between the whole and its parts. Come to terms and plot the propositions and arguments. Work at achieving understanding before you begin to criticize or to assess significance. These rules, by now, are all familiar. But they apply here with particular force.
    
    Short articles are usually primarily informational, and as such they require less active thinking on your part. You must make an effort to understand, to follow the account provided by the author, but you often do not have to go beyond that. In the case of such excellent popular books as Whitehead's Introduction to Mathematics, Lincoln Barnett's The Universe and Dr. Einstein, and Barry Commoner's The Closing Circle, something more is required. This is particularly true of a book like Commoner's, on a subject—the environmental crisis—of special interest and importance to all of us today. The writing is compact and requires constant attention. But the book as a whole has implications that the careful reader will not miss. Although it is not a practical work, in the sense described above in Chapter 13, its theoretical conclusions have important consequences. The mere mention of the book's subject matter—the environmental crisis—suggests this. The environment in question is our own; if it is undergoing a crisis of some sort, then it inevitably follows, even if the author had not said so—though in fact he has—that we are also involved in the crisis. The thing to do in a crisis is (usually) to act in a certain way, or to stop acting in a certain way. Thus Commoner's book, though essentially theoretical, has a significance that goes beyond the theoretical and into the realm of the practical.
    
    This is not to suggest that Commoner's work is important and the books by Whitehead and Barnett unimportant. When The Universe and Dr. Einstein was written, as a theoretical account (written for a popular audience) of the history of researches into the atom, people were widely aware of the

    perils inherent in atomic physics, as represented mainly but not
    exclusively by the recently discovered atomic bomb. Thus that
    theoretical book also had practical consequences. But even if
    people are today not so worried about the imminence of an
    atomic or nuclear war, there is still what may be called a
    practical necessity to read this theoretical book, or one like it.
    The reason is that atomic and nuclear physics is one of the
    great achievements of our age. It promises great things for
    man, at the same time that it poses great perils. An informed
    and concerned reader should know everything he can about
    the subject.
    
    A slightly different urgency is exerted by Whitehead's In-
    troduction to Mathematics. Mathematics is one of the major
    modern mysteries. Perhaps it is the leading one, occupying a
    place in our society similar to the religious mysteries of another
    age. If we want to know something about what our age is all
    about, we should have some understanding of what mathe-
    matics is, and of how the mathematician operates and thinks.
    Whitehead's book, although it does not go very deeply into
    the more abstruse branches of the subject, is remarkably elo-
    quent about the principles of mathematical reasoning. If it does
    nothing else, it shows the attentive reader that the mathemati-

    HOW TO READ PHILOSOPHY
    
    Children ask magnificent questions. "Why are people?" "What
    makes the cat tick?' "What's the world's first name?" "Did
    God have a reason for creating the earth?" Out of the mouths
    of babes comes, if not wisdom, at least the search for it.
    Philosophy, according to Aristotle, begins in wonder. It cer-
    tainly begins in childhood, even if for most of us it stops there,
    too.
  - |-
    The child is a natural questioner. It is not the number of questions he asks but their character that distinguishes him from the adult. Adults do not lose the curiosity that seems to be a native human trait, but their curiosity deteriorates in quality. They want to know whether something is so, not why. But children's questions are not limited to the sort that can be answered by an encyclopedia.
    
    What happens between the nursery and college to turn the flow of questions off, or, rather, to turn it into the duller channels of adult curiosity about matters of fact? A mind not agitated by good questions cannot appreciate the significance of even the best answers. It is easy enough to learn the answers. But to develop actively inquisitive minds, alive with real questions, profound questions—that is another story.
    
    Why should we have to try to develop such minds, when children are born with them? Somewhere along the line, adults must fail somehow to sustain the infant's curiosity at its original
    
    270
    How to Read Philosophy 271
    
    depth. School itself, perhaps, dulls the mind—by the dead weight of rote learning, much of which may be necessary. The failure is probably even more the parents' fault. We so often tell a child there is no answer, even when one is available, or demand that he ask no more questions. We thinly conceal our irritation when baffled by the apparently unanswerable query. All this discourages the child. He may get the impression that it is impolite to be too inquisitive. Human inquisitiveness is never killed; but it is soon debased to the sort of questions asked by most college students, who, like the adults they are soon to become, ask only for information.
  - |-
    We have no solution for this problem; we are certainly not  
    so brash as to think we can tell you how to answer the pro-  
    found and wondrous questions that children put. But we do  
    want you to recognize that one of the most remarkable things  
    about the great philosophical books is that they ask the same  
    sort of profound questions that children ask. The ability to  
    retain the child's view of the world, with at the same time a  
    mature understanding of what it means to retain it, is extremely  
    rare—and a person who has these qualities is likely to be able  
    to contribute something really important to our thinking.
    
    We are not required to think as children in order to under-  
    stand existence. Children certainly do not, and cannot, un-  
    derstand it—if, indeed, anyone can. But we must be able to see  
    as children see, to wonder as they wonder, to ask as they ask.  
    The complexities of adult life get in the way of the truth. The  
    great philosophers have always been able to clear away the  
    complexities and see simple distinctions—simple once they are  
    stated, vastly difficult before. If we are to follow them we too  
    must be childishly simple in our questions—and maturely wise  
    in our replies.
    
    The Questions Philosophers Ask
    
    What are these "childishly simple" questions that philoso-  
    phers ask? When we write them down, they do not seem  
    simple, because to answer them is so difficult. Nevertheless,  
    they are initially simple in the sense of being basic or funda-  
    mental.
  - |-
    Take the following questions about being or existence, for example: What is the difference between existing and not existing? What is common to all the things that do exist, and what are the properties of everything that does exist? Are there different ways in which things can exist—different modes of being or existence? Do some things exist only in the mind or for the mind, whereas others exist outside the mind, and whether or not they are known to us, or even knowable by us? Does everything that exists exist physically, or are there some things that exist apart from material embodiment? Do all things change, or is there anything that is immutable? Does anything exist necessarily, or must we say that everything that does exist might not have existed? Is the realm of possible existence larger than the realm of what actually does exist?
    
    These are typically the kind of questions that a philosopher asks when he is concerned to explore the nature of being itself and the realms of being. As questions, they are not difficult to state or understand, but they are enormously difficult to answer—so difficult, in fact, that there are philosophers, especially in recent times, who have held that they cannot be answered in any satisfactory manner.
    
    Another set of philosophical questions concerns change or becoming rather than being. Of the things in our experience to which we would unhesitatingly attribute existence, we would also say that all of them are subject to change. They come into being and pass away; while in being, most of them move from one place to another; and many of them change in quantity or in quality: they become larger or smaller, heavier or lighter; or, like the ripening apple and the aging beefsteak, they change in color.
    
    What is involved in any change? In every process of change, is there something that endures unchanged as well as some respect or aspect of that enduring thing which undergoes
  - |-
    change? When you learn something that you did not know
    before, you have certainly changed with respect to the knowledge you have acquired, but you are also the same individual
    that you were before; if that were not the case, you could not
    be said to have changed through learning. Is this true of all
    change? For example, is it true of such remarkable changes as
    birth and death—of coming to be and passing away—or only of
    less fundamental changes, such as local motion, growth, or
    alteration in quality? How many different kinds of change are
    there? Do the same fundamental elements or conditions enter
    into all processes of change, and are the same causes operative
    in all? What do we mean by a cause of change? Are there different types of causes responsible for change? Are the causes of
    change—of becoming—the same as the causes of being, or existence?
    
    Such questions are asked by the philosopher who turns his
    attention from being to becoming and also tries to relate becoming to being. Once again, they are not difficult questions
    to state or understand, though they are extremely difficult to
    answer clearly and well. In any case, you can see how they
    begin with a childishly simple attitude toward the world and
    our experience of it.
    
    Unfortunately, we do not have space to go into the whole
    range of questions more deeply. We can only list some other
    questions that philosophers ask and try to answer. There are
    questions not only about being and becoming, but also about
    necessity and contingency; about the material and the immaterial; about the physical and the non-physical; about freedom and indeterminacy; about the powers of the human mind;
    about the nature and extent of human knowledge; about the
    freedom of the will.
    
    All these questions are speculative or theoretical in the
    sense of those terms that we have employed in distinguishing
    between the theoretical and practical realms. But philosophy,
    as you know, is not restricted to theoretical questions only.
    
    Take good and evil, for instance. Children are much con-

    Concerned with the difference between good and bad; their be-
    hinds are likely to suffer if they make mistakes about it. But
    we do not stop wondering about the difference when we grow
    up. Is there a universally valid distinction between good and
    evil? Are there certain things that are always good, others that
    are always bad, whatever the circumstances? Or was Hamlet
    right when, echoing Montaigne, he said: "There is nothing
    either good or bad but thinking makes it so."
    
    Good and evil, of course, are not the same as right and
    wrong; the two pairs of terms seem to refer to different classes
    of things. In particular, even if we feel that whatever is right
    is good, we probably do not feel that whatever is wrong is evil.
    But how do we make this distinction precise?
    
    "Good" is an important philosophical word, but it is an
    important word in our everyday vocabulary, too. Trying to say
    what it means is a heady exercise; it will involve you very
    deeply in philosophy before you know it. There are many
    things that are good, or, as we would prefer to say, there are
    many goods. Is it possible to order the goods? Are some more
    important than others? Do some depend on others? Are there
    circumstances in which goods conflict, so that you have to
    choose one good at the expense of forgoing another?
    
    Again, we do not have space to go more extensively into
    these questions. We can only list some other questions in the
    practical realm. There are questions not only about good and
    evil, right and wrong, and the order of goods, but also about
    duties and obligations; about virtues and vices; about happi-
    ness, life's purpose or goal; about justice and rights in the
    sphere of human relations and social interaction; about the
    state and its relation to the individual, about the good society,
    the just polity, and the just economy; about war and peace.
    
    The two groups of questions that we have discussed deter-
    mine or identify two main divisions of philosophy. The ques-
    tions in the first group, the questions about being and becom-
    ing, have to do with what is or happens in the world. Such
  - |-

    questions belong to the division of philosophy that is called
    theoretical or speculative. The questions in the second group,
    the questions concerning good and evil, or right and wrong,
    have to do with what ought to be done or sought, and they
    belong to the division of philosophy that is sometimes called
    practical, and is more accurately called normative. Books that
    tell you how to make something, such as a cookbook, or how
    to do something, such as a driver's manual, need not try to
    argue that you ought to become a good cook, or learn to drive
    a car well; they can assume that you want to make or do some-
    thing and merely tell you how to succeed in your efforts. In
    contrast, books of normative philosophy concern themselves
    primarily with the goals all men ought to seek—goals such as
    leading a good life or instituting a good society—and, unlike
    cookbooks and driving manuals, they go no further than pre-
    scribing in the most universal terms the means that ought to
    be employed in order to achieve these goals.
    
    The questions that philosophers ask also serve to distin-
    guish subordinate branches of the two main divisions of philos-
    ophy. A work of speculative or theoretical philosophy is meta-
    physical if it is mainly concerned with questions about being
    or existence. It is a work in the philosophy of nature if it
    is concerned with becoming—with the nature and kinds of
    changes, their conditions and causes. If its primary concern is
    with knowledge—with questions about what is involved in our
    knowing anything, with the causes, extent, and limits of human
    knowledge, and with its certainties and uncertainties—then it
    is a work in epistemology, which is just another name for
    theory of knowledge. Turning from theoretical to normative
    philosophy, the main distinction is between questions about the
    good life and what is right or wrong in the conduct of the
    individual, all of which fall within the sphere of ethics, and
    questions about the good society and the conduct of the in-
    dividual in relation to the community—the sphere of politics or
    political philosophy.
    
    Modern Philosophy and the Great Tradition
  - |-
    For the sake of brevity in what follows, let us call questions about what is and happens in the world, or about what men ought to do or seek, "first-order questions." We should recognize, then, that there are also "second-order questions" that can be asked: questions about our first-order knowledge, questions about the content of our thinking when we try to answer first-order questions, questions about the ways in which we express such thoughts in language.
    
    This distinction between first-order and second-order questions is useful, because it helps to explain what has happened to philosophy in recent years. The majority of professional philosophers at the present day no longer believe that first-order questions can be answered by philosophers. Most professional philosophers today devote their attention exclusively to second-order questions, very often to questions having to do with the language in which thought is expressed.
    
    That is all to the good, for it is never harmful to be critical. The trouble is the wholesale giving up of first-order philosophical questions, which are the ones that are most likely to interest lay readers. In fact, philosophy today, like contemporary science or mathematics, is no longer being written for lay readers. Second-order questions are, almost by definition, ones of narrow appeal; and professional philosophers, like scientists, are not interested in the views of anyone but other experts.
    
    This makes modern philosophy very hard to read for non-philosophers—as difficult, indeed, as science for non-scientists. We cannot in this book give you any advice about how to read modern philosophy as long as it is concerned exclusively with second-order questions. However, there are philosophical books that you can read, and that we believe you should read. These books ask the kinds of questions that we have called first-order ones. It is not accidental that they were also written primarily for a lay audience rather than exclusively for other philosophers.
  - |-
    Up to about 1930, or perhaps even a little later, philosophical books were written for the general reader. Philosophers hoped to be read by their peers, but they also wanted to be read by ordinary, intelligent men and women. Since the questions that they asked and tried to answer were of concern to everyone, they thought that everyone should know what they thought.
    
    All of the great classical works in philosophy, from Plato onward, were written from this point of view. These books are accessible to the lay reader; you can succeed in reading them if you wish to. Everything that we have to say in this chapter is intended to help you do that.
    
    On Philosophical Method
    
    It is important to understand what philosophical method consists in—at least insofar as philosophy is conceived as asking and trying to answer first-order questions. Suppose that you are a philosopher who is troubled by one of the childishly simple questions we have mentioned—the question, for instance, about the properties of everything that exists, or the question about the nature and causes of change. How do you proceed?
    
    If your question were scientific, you would know that to answer it you would have to perform some kind of special research, either by way of developing an experiment to test your answer, or by way of observing a wide range of phenomena. If your question were historical, you would know that you would also have to perform research, although of a different kind. But there is no experiment that will tell you what all existing things have in common, precisely in respect to having existence. There are no special kinds of phenomena that you can observe, no documents that you can seek out and read, in order to find out what change is or why things change. All you can do is reflect upon the question. There is, in short, nothing to do but think.
    
    You are not thinking in a total vacuum, of course. Philoso-

    phy, when it is good, is not "pure" speculation—thinking di-
    vorced from experience. Ideas cannot be put together just any-
    way. There are stringent tests of the validity of answers to
    philosophical questions. But such tests are based on common
    experience alone—on the experience that you already have be-
    cause you are a human being, not a philosopher. You are as
    well acquainted through common experience with the phenom-
    ena of change as anybody else; everything in the world about
    you manifests mutability. As far as the mere experience of
    change goes, you are in as good a position to think about its
    nature and causes as the greatest philosophers. What distin-
    guishes them is that they thought about it extremely well: they
    formulated the most penetrating questions that could be asked
    about it, and they undertook to develop carefully and clearly
    worked-out answers. By what means? Not by investigation. Not
    by having or trying to get more experience than the rest of us
    have. Rather, by thinking more profoundly about the experi-
    ence than the rest of us have.
    
    Understanding this is not enough. We must also realize
    that not all of the questions that philosophers have asked and
    tried to answer are truly philosophical. They themselves were
    not always aware of this, and their ignorance or mistake in this
    crucial respect can cause unperceptive readers considerable
    difficulty. To avoid such difficulties, it is necessary to be able
    to distinguish the truly philosophical questions from the other
    questions that a philosopher may deal with, but that he should
    have waived and left for later scientific investigation to answer.
    The philosopher was misled by failing to see that such ques-
    tions can be answered by scientific investigation, though he
    probably could not have known this at the time of his writing.
    
    An example of this is the question that ancient philoso-
    phers asked about the difference between the matter of ter-
    restrial and celestial bodies. To their observation, unaided by
    telescopes, it appeared to be the case that the heavenly bodies
    changed only in place; they did not appear to come into being
    or to pass away, like plants and animals; nor did they appear
  - |-

    to change in size or quality. Because celestial bodies were subject to one kind of change only—local motion—whereas all terrestrial bodies change in other respects as well, the ancients concluded that they had to be composed of a different kind of matter. They did not surmise, nor could they probably have surmised, that with the invention of the telescope, the heavenly bodies would give us knowledge of their mutability beyond anything we can know through common experience. Hence they took as a question that they thought it proper for philosophers to answer one that should have been reserved for later scientific investigation. Such investigation began with Galileo's use of the telescope and his discovery of the moons of Jupiter; this led to the revolutionary assertion by Kepler that the matter of the heavenly bodies is exactly the same as the matter of bodies on earth; and this in turn laid the groundwork for Newton's formulation of a celestial mechanics in which the same laws of motion apply without qualification to all bodies wherever they are in the physical universe.
    
    On the whole, apart from the confusions that may result, the misinformation or lack of information about scientific matters that mars the work of the classical philosophers is irrelevant. The reason is that it is philosophical questions, not scientific or historical ones, that we are interested in when we read a philosophical work. And, at the risk of repeating ourselves, we must emphasize that there is no other way than thinking to answer such questions. If we could build a telescope or microscope to examine the properties of existence, we should do so, of course. But no such instruments are possible.
    
    We do not want to give the impression that it is only philosophers who make mistakes of the sort we are discussing here. Suppose a scientist becomes troubled by the question about the kind of life a man ought to lead. This is a question in normative philosophy, and the only way to answer it is by thinking about it. But the scientist may not realize that, and instead suppose that some kind of experiment or research will give him an answer. He may decide to ask 1,000 persons what

    kind of life they would like to lead, and base his answer to the
    question on their answers. But it should be obvious that his
    answer, in that case, would be as irrelevant as Aristotle's specu-
    lations about the matter of the celestial bodies.
    
    On Philosophical Styles
    
    Although there is only one philosophical method, there are
    at least five styles of exposition that have been employed by
    the great philosophers of the Western tradition. The student
    or reader of philosophy should be able to distinguish between
    them and know the advantages and disadvantages of each.
    
    1, THE PHILOSPICAL DIALOGUE: The first philosophical
    style of exposition, first in time if not in effectiveness, is the one
    adopted by Plato in his Dialogues. The style is conversational,
    even colloquial; a number of men discuss a subject with
    Socrates (or, in the later dialogues, with a speaker known as
    The Athenian Stranger); often, after a certain amount of
    fumbling, Socrates embarks on a series of questions and com-
    ments that help to elucidate the subject. In the hands of a
    master like Plato, this style is heuristic, that is, it allows the
    reader, indeed leads him, to discover things for himself. When
    the style is enriched by the high drama—some would say the
    high comedy—of the story of Socrates, it becomes enormously
    powerful.
    
    "A master like Plato," we said—but there is no one "like"
    Plato. Other philosophers have attempted dialogues—for ex-
    ample, Cicero and Berkeley—but with little success. Their dia-
    logues are flat, dull, almost unreadable. It is a measure of the
    greatness of Plato that he was able to write philosophical dia-
    logues that, for wit, charm, and profundity are the equal of
    any books ever produced by anyone, on any subject. Yet it may
    be a sign of the inappropriateness of this style of philosophiz-
    ing that no one except Plato has ever been able to handle it
    effectively.
  - |-
    That Plato did so, goes without saying. All Western philosophy, Whitehead once remarked, is but "a footnote to Plato"; and the later Greeks themselves had a saying: "Everywhere I go in my head, I meet Plato coming back." Those statements, however, should not be misunderstood. Plato himself had apparently no philosophical system, no doctrine—unless it was that there is no doctrine, that we should simply keep talking. And asking questions. For Plato, and Socrates before him, did indeed manage to raise most of the important questions that subsequent philosophers have felt it necessary to deal with.
    
    2. THE PHILOSOPHICAL TREATISE OR Essay: Aristotle was Plato's best pupil; he studied under him for twenty years. He is said to have also written dialogues, but none of these survive entirely. What does survive are curiously difficult essays or treatises on a number of different subjects. Aristotle was obviously a clear thinker, but the difficulty of the surviving works has led scholars to suggest that they were originally notes for lectures or books—either Aristotle's own notes, or notes taken down by a student who heard the master speak. We may never know the truth of the matter, but in any event the Aristotelean treatise was a new style in philosophy.
    
    The subjects covered by Aristotle in his treatises, and the various styles adopted by him in presenting his findings, also helped to establish the branches and approaches of philosophy in the succeeding centuries. There are, first of all, the so-called popular works—mostly dialogues, of which only fragments have come down to us. Then there are the documentary collections. The major one that we know about was a collection of 158 separate constitutions of Greek states. Only one of these survives, the constitution of Athens, which was recovered from a papyrus in 1890. Finally, there are the major treatises, some of which, like the Physics and Metaphysics, or the Ethics, Politics, and Poetics, are purely philosophical works, theoretical or normative; some of which, like the book On the Soul, are mixtures of philosophical theory and early scientific investigation.

    section; and some of which, like the biological treatises, are
    mainly scientific works in the field of natural history.
    Immanuel Kant, although he was probably more influ-
    enced by Plato in a philosophical sense, adopted Aristotle's
    style of exposition. His treatises are finished works of art, un-
    like Aristotle's in this respect. They state the main problem
    first, go through the subject matter in a thorough and business-
    like way, and treat special problems by the way or at the last.
    The clarity of both Kant and Aristotle may be said to consist
    in the order that they impose on a subject. We see a philo-
    sophical beginning, middle, and end. We also, particularly in
    the case of Aristotle, are provided with accounts of the views
    and objections of others, both philosophers and ordinary men.
    Thus, in one sense the style of the treatise is similar to the
    style of the dialogue. But the element of drama is missing from
    the Kantian or Aristotelean treatise; a philosophical view is
    developed through straightforward exposition rather than
    through the conflict of positions and opinions, as in Plato.
    
    3. THE MEETING oF Opjecrions: The philosophical style
    developed in the Middle Ages and perfected by St. Thomas
    Aquinas in his Summa Theologica has likenesses to both of
    those already discussed. Plato, we have pointed out, raises
    most of the persistent philosophical problems; and Socrates,
    as we might have observed, asks in the course of the dialogues
    the kind of simple but profound questions that children ask.
    And Aristotle, as we have also pointed out, recognizes the
    objections of other philosophers and replies to them.
    
    Aquinas' style is a combination of question-raising and
    objection-meeting. The Summa is divided into parts, treatises,
    questions, and articles. The form of all the articles is the same.
    A question is posed; the opposite (wrong) answer to it is
    given; arguments are educed in support of that wrong answer;
    these are countered first by an authoritative text (often a quo-
    tation from Scripture ); and finally, Aquinas introduces his own
    answer or solution with the words "I answer that." Having
    How to Read Philosophy 283
    
    given his own view of the matter, he then replies to each of the
    arguments for the wrong answer.
  - |-
    The neatness and order of this style are appealing to men  
    with orderly minds, but that is not the most important feature  
    of the Thomistic way of philosophizing. Rather, it is Aquinas'  
    explicit recognition of conflicts, his reporting of different views,  
    and his attempt to meet all possible objections to his own  
    solutions. The idea that the truth somehow evolves out of  
    opposition and conflict was a common medieval one. Philoso-  
    phers in Aquinas' time accepted as a matter of course that they  
    should be prepared to defend their views in open, public dis-  
    putes, which were often attended by crowds of students and  
    other interested persons. The civilization of the Middle Ages  
    was essentially oral, partly because books were few and hard  
    to come by. A proposition was not accepted as true unless it  
    could meet the test of open discussion; the philosopher was  
    not a solitary thinker, but instead faced his oponents in the  
    intellectual market place (as Socrates might have said). Thus,  
    the Summa Theologica is imbued with the spirit of debate and  
    discussion.
    
    4, THE SYSTEMIZATION OF PHILOSOPhY: In the seventeenth  
    century, a fourth style of philosophical exposition was devel-  
    oped by two notable philosophers, Descartes and Spinoza.  
    Fascinated by the promised success of mathematics in organ-  
    izing man's knowledge of nature, they attempted to organize  
    philosophy itself in a way akin to the organization of mathe-  
    matics.
    
    Descartes was a great mathematician and, although per-  
    haps wrong on some points, a redoubtable philosopher. What  
    he tried to do, essentially, was to clothe philosophy in mathe-  
    matical dress—to give it the certainty and formal structure that  
    Euclid, two thousand years before, had given geometry. Des-  
    cartes was not wholly unsuccessful in this, and his demand for  
    clarity and distinctness in thinking was to some extent justified  
    in the chaotic intellectual climate of his time. He also wrote  
    ¶284 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    philosophical treatises in a more or less traditional form, in-

    Spinoza carried the conception even farther. His Ethics is
    written in strict mathematical form, with propositions, proofs,
    corollaries, lemmas, scholiums, and the like. However, the
    subject matter of metaphysics and of morals is not very satis-
    factorily handled in this manner, which is more appropriate
    for geometry and other mathematical subjects than for philo-
    sophical ones. A sign of this is that when reading Spinoza you
    can skip a great deal, in exactly the same way that you can
    skip in Newton. You cannot skip anything in Kant or Aristotle,
    because the line of reasoning is continuous; and you cannot
    skip anything in Plato, any more than you would skip a part of
    a play or poem.
    
    Probably there are no absolute rules of rhetoric. Nevertheless, it is questionable whether it is possible to write a satisfactory philosophical work in mathematical form, as Spinoza tried to do, or a satisfactory scientific work in dialogue form, as Galileo tried to do. The fact is that both of these men failed to some extent to communicate what they wished to communicate, and it seems likely that the form they chose was a major reason for the failure.
    
    5. THE APHORISTIC STYLE: There is one other style of philosophical exposition that deserves mention, although it is probably not as important as the other four. This is the aphoristic style adopted by Nietzsche in such works as Thus Spake Zarathustra and by certain modern French philosophers. The popularity of this style during the past century is perhaps owing to the great interest, among Western readers, in the wisdom books of the East, which are written in an aphoristic style. This style may also owe something to the example of Pascal's Pensées. But of course Pascal did not intend to leave his great work in the form of short, enigmatic statements; he died before he could finish writing out the book in essay form.
    
    The great advantage of the aphoristic form in philosophy
    is that it is heuristic, the reader has the impression that more

    It is being said than is actually said, for he does much of the work
    of thinking—of making connections between statements and of
    constructing arguments for positions—himself. At the same
    time, however, this is the great disadvantage of the style,
    which is really not expositional at all. The author is like a hit-
    and-run driver; he touches on a subject, he suggests a truth or
    insight about it, and then runs off to another subject without
    properly defending what he has said. Thus, although the
    aphoristic style is enjoyable for those who are poetically in-
    clined, it is irritating for serious philosophers who would
    rather try to follow and criticize an author's line of thought.
    
    As far as we know, there is no other important style of
    philosophical exposition that has been employed in our
    Western tradition. (A work like Lucretius' On the Nature of
    Things is not an exception. It was originally in verse; but as
    far as its style goes, it is no different from other philosophical
    essays; and in any event we ordinarily read it nowadays in
    prose translations.) This means that all of the great philoso-
    phers have employed one or the other of these five styles; some-
    times, of course, a philosopher tries more than one. The treatise
    or essay is probably the most common form, both in the past
    and in the present. It can range all the way from highly formal
    and difficult works like those of Kant, to popular philosophical
    essays or letters. Dialogues are notoriously hard to write, and
    the geometrical style is enormously difficult both to write and
    to read. The aphoristic style is highly unsatisfactory from a
    philosophical point of view. The Thomistic style has not been
    used very much in recent times. Perhaps it would not be ac-
    ceptable to modern readers, but that seems a shame,
    considering all its advantages.
    
    Hints for Reading Philosophy
    
    It is perhaps clear from the discussion so far that the most
    important thing to discover in reading any philosophical work
    is the question or questions it tries to answer. The questions
    may be stated explicitly, or they may be implicit to a certain
    extent. In either case, you must try to find out what they are.
  - |-
    How the author answers these questions will be deeply affected by his controlling principles. These may be stated, too, but that is not always the case. We have already quoted Basil Willey on the difficulty—and the importance—of discovering the hidden and unstated assumptions of an author, to say nothing of our own. This goes for any book. It applies to works in philosophy with particular force.
    
    The great philosophers cannot be charged with having tried to hide their assumptions dishonestly, or with having been unclear in their definitions and postulations. It is precisely the mark of a great philosopher that he makes these things clearer than other writers can. Nevertheless, every great philosopher has certain controlling principles that underlie his work. These are easy enough to see if he states them in the book you are reading. But he may not have done so, reserving their treatment for another book. Or he may never treat them explicitly, but instead allow them to pervade every one of his works.
    
    It is difficult to give examples of such controlling principles. Any that we might proffer would probably be disputed by philosophers, and we do not here have space to defend our choices. Nevertheless, we could mention the controlling idea of Plato that conversation about philosophical subjects is perhaps the most important of all human activities. Now this idea is seldom explicitly stated in the dialogues, although Socrates may be saying it when, in the Apology, he asserts that the unexamined life is not worth living, and Plato mentions it in the Seventh Letter. The point is that Plato expresses this view in a number of other places, though not in so many words—for example, in the Protagoras, where the audience is shown as disapproving of Protagoras' unwillingness to continue talking to Socrates. Another example is that of Cephalus, in Book I of the Republic, who happens to have other business to attend to and so departs. Plato seems to be saying here, though not explicitly, that conversation is important.
  - |-
    Explicitly, that it is a betrayal of man's deepest nature to refuse
    to join, for whatever reason, in the search for truth. But, as
    we have noted, this is not ordinarily cited as one of Plato's
    "ideas," because it is seldom explicitly discussed in his works.
    
    We can find other examples in Aristotle. In the first place,
    it is always important to recognize, in reading any Aristotelean
    work, that things said in other works are relevant to the dis-
    cussion. Thus the basic principles of logic, expounded in the
    Organon, are assumed in the Physics. In the second place,
    owing partly to the fact that the treatises are not finished works
    of art, their controlling principles are not always stated with
    satisfactory clarity. The Ethics is about many things: happi-
    ness, habit, virtue, pleasure, and so forth—the list could be
    very long. But the controlling insight is discovered only by the
    very careful reader. This is the insight that happiness is the
    whole of the good, not the highest good, for in that case it
    would be only one good among others. Recognizing this, we
    see that happiness does not consist in self-perfection, or the
    goods of self-improvement, even though these constitute the
    highest among partial goods. Happiness, as Aristotle says, is
    the quality of a whole life, and he means "whole" not only in
    a temporal sense but also in terms of all the aspects from which
    a life can be viewed. The happy man is one, as we might say
    nowadays, who puts it all together—and keeps it there through-
    out his life. This insight is controlling in the sense that it affects
    almost all of the other ideas and insights in the Ethics, but it
    is not stated nearly as explicitly as it might be.
  - |-
    One more example. Kant's mature thought is often known as critical philosophy. He himself contrasted "criticism" to "dogmatism," which he imputed to many previous philosophers. By "dogmatism" he meant the presumption that the human intellect can arrive at the most important truths by pure thinking, without being aware of its own limitations. What is first required, according to Kant, is a critical survey and assessment of the mind's resources and powers. Thus, the limitation of the mind is a controlling principle in Kant in a way that it is not in any philosopher who precedes him in time. But while this is perfectly clear because explicitly stated in the Critique of Pure Reason, it is not stated, because it is assumed, in the Critique of Judgment, Kant's major work in aesthetics. Nevertheless, it is controlling there as well.
    
    This is all we can say about finding the controlling principles in a philosophical book, because we are not sure that we can tell you how to discover them. Sometimes it takes years to do this, and many readings and rereadings. Nevertheless, it is the ideal goal of a good and thorough reading, and you should keep in mind that it is ultimately what you must try to do if you are to understand your author. Despite the difficulty of discovering these controlling principles, however, we do not recommend that you take the shortcut of reading books about the philosophers, their lives and opinions. The discovery you come to on your own will be much more valuable than someone else's ideas.
  - |-
    Once you have found an author's controlling principles,  
    you will want to decide whether he adheres to them throughout his work. Unfortunately, philosophers, even the best of  
    them, often do not do so. Consistency, Emerson said, "is the  
    hobgoblin of little minds." That is a very carefree statement,  
    but although it is probably wise to remember it, there is no  
    doubt, either, that inconsistency in a philosopher is a serious  
    problem. If a philosopher is inconsistent, you have to decide  
    which of two sets of propositions he really means—the first  
    principles, as he states them; or the conclusions, which do not  
    in fact follow from the principles as stated. Or you may decide  
    that neither is valid.
    
    The reading of philosophical works has special aspects  
    that relate to the difference between philosophy and science.  
    We are here considering only theoretical works in philosophy,  
    such as metaphysical treatises or books about the philosophy  
    of nature.
    
    The philosophical problem is to explain, not to describe,  
    as science does, the nature of things. Philosophy asks about  
    more than the connections of phenomena. It seeks to penetrate  
    How to Read Philosophy 289
    
    to the ultimate causes and conditions that underlie them. Such  
    problems are satisfactorily explored only when the answers to  
    them are supported by clear arguments and analysis.
    
    The major effort of the reader, therefore, must be with  
    respect to the terms and the initial propositions. Although the  
    philosopher, like the scientist, has a technical terminology,  
    the words that express his terms are usually taken from com-  
    mon speech, but used in a very special sense. This demands  
    special care from the reader. If he does not overcome the  
    tendency to use familiar words in a familiar way, he will  
    probably make gibberish and nonsense of the book.
    
    The basic terms of philosophical discussions are, of course,  
    abstract. But so are those of science. No general knowledge is  
    expressible except in abstract terms. There is nothing particu-  
    larly difficult about abstractions. We use them every day of  
    our lives and in every sort of conversation. However, the words  
    "abstract" and "concrete" seem to trouble many persons.
  - |-
    Whenever you talk generally about anything, you are  
    using abstractions. What you perceive through your senses is  
    always concrete and particular. What you think with your  
    mind is always abstract and general. To understand an "ab-  
    stract word" is to have the idea it expresses. "Having an idea"  
    is just another way of saying that you understand some general  
    aspect of the things you experience concretely. You cannot see  
    or touch or even imagine the general aspect thus referred to.  
    If you could, there would be no difference between the senses  
    and the mind. People who try to imagine what ideas refer to  
    befuddle themselves, and end up with a hopeless feeling about  
    all abstractions.
    
    Just as inductive arguments should be the reader's main  
    focus in the case of scientific books, so here, in the case of  
    philosophy, you must pay closest attention to the philosopher's  
    principles. They may be either things he asks you to assume  
    with him, or matters that he calls self-evident. There is no  
    trouble about assumptions. Make them to see what follows,  
    even if you yourself have contrary presuppositions, It is a good  
    mental exercise to pretend that you believe something you  
    290 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    really do not believe. And the clearer you are about your own  
    prejudgments, the more likely you will be not to misjudge  
    those made by others.
    
    It is the other sort of principles that may cause trouble.  
    Few philosophical books fail to state some propositions that  
    the author regards as self-evident. Such propositions are drawn  
    directly from experience rather than proved by other proposi-  
    tions.
    
    The thing to remember is that the experience from which  
    they are drawn, as we have noted more than once, is, unlike  
    the scientist's special experience, the common experience of  
    mankind. The philosopher does no work in laboratories, no  
    research in the field. Hence to understand and test a philoso-  
    pher's leading principles you do not need the extrinsic aid of  
    special experience, obtained by methodical investigation. He  
    refers you to your own common sense and daily observation of  
    the world in which you live.
  - |-
    In other words, the method according to which you should read a philosophical book is very similar to the method according to which it is written. A philosopher, faced with a problem, can do nothing but think about it. A reader, faced with a philosophical book, can do nothing but read it—which means, as we know, thinking about it. There are no other aids except the mind itself.
    
    But this essential loneliness of reader and book is precisely the situation that we imagined at the beginning of our long discussion of the rules of analytical reading. Thus you can see why we say that the rules of reading, as we have stated and explained them, apply more directly to the reading of philosophical books than to the reading of any other kind.
    
    On Making Up Your Own Mind
    
    A good theoretical work in philosophy is as free from oratory and propaganda as a good scientific treatise. You do not have to be concerned about the "personality" of the author, or investigate his social and economic background. There is, however, utility in reading the works of other great philosophers who have dealt with the same problems as your author. The philosophers have carried on a long conversation with each other in the history of thought. You had better listen in on it before you make up your mind about what any of them says.
    
    The fact that philosophers disagree should not trouble you, for two reasons. First, the fact of disagreement, if it is persistent, may point to a great unsolved and, perhaps, insoluble problem. It is good to know where the true mysteries are. Second, the disagreements of others are relatively unimportant. Your responsibility is only to make up your own mind. In the presence of the long conversation that the philosophers have carried on through their books, you must judge what is true and what is false. When you have read a philosophical book well—and that means reading other philosophers on the same subject, too—you are in a position to judge.
  - |-
    It is, indeed, the most distinctive mark of philosophical questions that everyone must answer them for himself. Taking the opinions of others is not solving them, but evading them. And your answers must be solidly grounded, with arguments to back them up. This means, above all, that you cannot depend on the testimony of experts, as you may have to do in the case of science.
    
    The reason is that the questions philosophers ask are simply more important than the questions asked by anyone else. Except children.
    
    A Note on Theology
    
    There are two kinds of theology, natural theology and dogmatic theology. Natural theology is a branch of philosophy; it is the last chapter, as it were, in metaphysics. If you ask, for example, whether causation is an endless process, whether everything is caused, you may find yourself, if you answer in the affirmative, involved in an infinite regress. Therefore you may have to posit some originating cause that is not itself caused. Aristotle called this uncaused cause an unmoved mover. You could give it other names—you could even say that it was merely another name for God—but the point is that you would have arrived at the conception by the unaided effort—the natural working—of your mind.
    
    Dogmatic theology differs from philosophy in that its first principles are articles of faith adhered to by the communicants of some religion. A work of dogmatic theology always depends upon dogmas and the authority of a church that proclaims them.
    
    If you are not of the faith, if you do not belong to the church, you can nevertheless read such a theological book well by treating its dogmas with the same respect you treat the assumptions of a mathematician. But you must always keep in mind that an article of faith is not something that the faithful assume. Faith, for those who have it, is the most certain form of knowledge, not a tentative opinion.

    Understanding this seems to be difficult for many readers today. Typically, they make either or both of two mistakes in dealing with dogmatic theology. The first mistake is to refuse to accept, even temporarily, the articles of faith that are the first principles of the author. As a result, the reader continues to struggle with these first principles, never really paying attention to the book itself. The second mistake is to assume that, because the first principles are dogmatic, the arguments based on them, the reasoning that they support, and the conclusions to which they lead are all dogmatic in the same way.
    
    It is true enough, of course, if certain principles are accepted, and the reasoning that is based on them is cogent, that the conclusions must then be accepted too—at least to the extent that the principles are. But if the reasoning is defective, the most acceptable first principles will lead to invalid conclusions.
    
    We are speaking here, as you can see, of the difficulties that face a non-believing reader of a theological work. His task is to accept the first principles as true while he is reading the book, and then to read it with all the care that any good expository work deserves. The faithful reader of a work that is essential to his faith has other difficulties to face. However, these problems are not confined to reading theology.
    
    How to Read "Canonical" Books
    
    There is one very interesting kind of book, one kind of reading, that has not yet been discussed. We use the term "canonical" to refer to such books; in an older tradition we might have called them "sacred" or "holy," but those words no longer apply to all such works, though they still apply to some of them.
    
    A prime example is the Holy Bible, when it is read not as literature but instead as the revealed Word of God. For orthodox Marxists, however, the works of Marx must be read in much the same way as the Bible must be read by orthodox Jews or Christians. And Mao Tse-tung's Little Red Book has an equally canonical character for a "faithful" Chinese Communist.
  - |-
    The notion of a canonical book can be extended beyond these obvious examples. Consider any institution—a church, a political party, a society—that among other things (1) is a teaching institution, (2) has a body of doctrine to teach, and (3) has a faithful and obedient membership. The members of any such organization read reverentially. They do not—even cannot—question the authorized or right reading of the books that to them are canonical. The faithful are debarred by their faith from finding error in the "sacred" text, to say nothing of finding nonsense there.
    
    Orthodox Jews read the old Testament in this way; Christians, the New Testament; Muslims, the Koran; orthodox Marxists, the works of Marx and Lenin and, depending on the political climate, those of Stalin; orthodox Freudian psycho-analysts, the works of Freud; U.S. Army officers, the infantry manual. And you can think of many more examples by yourself.
    
    In fact, almost all of us, even if we have not quite reached it, have approached the situation in which we must read canonically. A fledgling lawyer, intent on passing the bar exams, must read certain texts in a certain way in order to attain a perfect score. So with doctors and other professionals; and indeed so with all of us when, as students, we were required at the peril of "failure" to read a text according to our professor's interpretation of it. (Of course, not all professors fail their students for disagreeing with them!)
  - |-
    The characteristics of this kind of reading are perhaps
    summed up in the word "orthodox," which is almost always
    applicable. The word comes from two Greek roots, meaning
    "right opinion." These are books for which there is one and
    only one right reading, any other reading or interpretation is
    fraught with peril, from the loss of an "A" to the damnation
    of one's soul. This characteristic carries with it an obligation.
    The faithful reader of a canonical book is obliged to make
    sense out of it and to find it true in one or another sense of
    "true." If he cannot do this by himself, he is obliged to go to
    someone who can. This may be a priest or a rabbi, or it may be
    his superior in the party hierarchy, or it may be his professor.
    In any case, he is obliged to accept the resolution of his prob-
    lem that is offered him. He reads essentially without freedom;
    but in return for this he gains a kind of satisfaction that is
    possibly never obtained when reading other books.
    
    Here, in fact, we must stop. The problem of reading the
    Holy Book—if you have faith that it is the Word of God—is the
    most difficult problem in the whole field of reading. There
    have been more books written about how to read Scripture
    than about all other aspects of the art of reading together. The
    Word of God is obviously the most difficult writing men can
    read; but it is also, if you believe it is the Word of God, the
    most important to read. The effort of the faithful has been
    duly proportionate to the difficulty of the task. It would be
    true to say that, in the European tradition at least, the Bible is
    the book in more senses than one. It has been not only the most
    widely read, but also the most carefully read, book of all.
    
    19
    HOW TO READ SOCIAL SCIENCE
    
    The concepts and terminology of the social sciences pervade
    almost everything we read today.
  - |-
    Modern journalism, for example, does not limit itself to reporting facts, except in the kind of shorthand, "who-what-why-when-where" news story that one finds on the front page of a newspaper. Journalists, much more commonly, enmesh the facts in interpretation, commentary, analysis of the news. These interpretations and comments draw on the concepts and terminology of the social sciences.
    
    These concepts and this terminology are also reflected in the vast number of current books and articles that may be grouped together under the heading of social criticism. We are confronted with a continuous flow of literature on such subjects as race problems, crime, law enforcement, poverty, education, welfare, war and peace, good and bad government. Much of this literature borrows its ideology and language from the social sciences.
    
    The literature of social science is not confined to non-fiction. There is also a large and important category of contemporary writing that might be termed social-science fiction. Here the aim is to create artificial models of society that allow us, for example, to explore the social consequences of technological innovation. The organization of social power, the kinds of property and ownership, and the distribution of wealth are variously described, deplored, or lauded in novels, plays, stories, moving pictures, television shows. Insofar as they do this they may be said to have social significance or to contain "relevant messages." At the same time they draw on and disseminate elements of the social sciences.
    
    Furthermore, there is hardly any social, economic, or political problem that has not been tackled by specialists in these fields, either on their own or by invitation from officials who are actively coping with these problems. Specialists in the social sciences help to formulate the problems and are called upon to help in dealing with them.
    
    Far from the least important factor in the growing pervasiveness of the social sciences is their introduction at the high school level and in the junior and community colleges. In fact, student enrollments in social science courses are running far ahead of enrollments in the more traditional literature and language courses. And enrollments in social science courses greatly exceed those in courses dealing with the "pure" sciences.
    
    What Is Social Science?
  - |-
    We have been talking of social science as if it were a  
    single entity. That is hardly the case.
    
    Which, in fact, are the social sciences? One way to  
    answer the question is to see what departments and disciplines  
    universities group under this name. Social science divisions  
    usually include departments of anthropology, economics, poli-  
    tics, and sociology. Why do they not ordinarily include as well  
    schools of law, education, business, social service, and public  
    administration, all of which draw on the concepts and methods  
    of the social sciences for their development? The reason com-  
    monly given for the separation of these schools from the  
    social science divisions is that the main purpose of such schools  
    is to train for professional work outside of the university, while the previously mentioned departments are more exclu-  
    sively dedicated to the pursuit of systematic knowledge of  
    human society, an activity that usually goes on within the  
    university.
    
    There is presently a trend in universities toward the  
    establishment of centers and institutes for interdisciplinary  
    studies. These centers cut across the conventional social sci-  
    ence departments and professional schools, and include studies  
    in the theories and methods of statistics, demography, pseph-  
    ology (the science of elections and polling), policy- and deci-  
    sion-making, recruitment and treatment of personnel, public  
    administration, human ecology, and many more. Such centers  
    are producing studies and reports that incorporate findings of  
    a dozen or more of these specialties. Considerable sophistica-  
    tion is required even to discern the various strands of these  
    efforts, let alone judge the validity of the findings and conclu-  
    sions.
    
    What about psychology? Those social scientists who in-  
    terpret their field strictly tend to exclude psychology on the  
    grounds that it concerns itself with individual and personal  
    characteristics, while the social sciences proper focus on cul-  
    tural, institutional, and environmental factors. Those who are  
    less strict, while conceding that physiological psychology  
    should be subsumed under the biological sciences, hold that  
    psychology, both normal and abnormal, should be regarded  
    as a social science on the grounds of the inseparability of the  
    individual from his social environment.
  - |-
    Psychology, incidentally, is a prime example of a social science area that is currently enjoying great popularity among students. It is possible that enrollments in psychology across the country are larger than in any other subject. And the literature of psychology, at every level from the most technical to the most popular, is enormous.
    
    What of the behavioral sciences? Where do they fit into the social science picture? As originally used, the term be-
    havioral science included sociology and anthropology and the behavioral aspects of biology, economics, geography, law, psychology and psychiatry, and political science. The accent on behavior served to emphasize observable, measurable be-
    havior capable of being systematically investigated and of producing verifiable findings. Recently, the term behavioral
    sciences has come to be used almost as a synonym of the term social sciences, but many purists object to this usage.
    
    Finally, what about history? It is acknowledged that the
    social sciences draw on the study of history for data and for
    exemplifications of their generalizations. However, although
    history, viewed as accounts of particular events and persons,
    may be scientific in the minimal sense of constituting system-
    atic knowledge, it is not a science in the sense that of itself it
    yields systematic knowledge of patterns or laws of behavior
    and development.
    
    Is it possible, then, to define what we mean by social sci-
    ence? We think so, at least for the purposes of this chapter.
    Such fields as anthropology, economics, politics, and sociology
    constitute a kind of central core of social science, which almost
    all social scientists would include in any definition. In addition,
    we think it would be conceded by most social scientists that
    much, though not all, of the literature of such fields as law,
    education, and public administration, and some of the litera-
    ture of such fields as business and social service, together with
    a considerable portion of psychological literature, falls within
    the confines of a reasonable definition. We will assume that
    such a definition, although admittedly imprecise, is clear to
    you in what follows.
    
    The Apparent Ease of Reading Social Science
  - |-
    A great deal of social science writing seems like the easiest possible material to read. The data are often drawn from experiences familiar to the reader—in this respect, social science is like poetry or philosophy—and the style of exposition is usually narrative, already familiar to the reader through his reading of fiction and history.
    
    In addition, we have all become familiar with the jargon of social science and use it often. Such terms as culture (cross, counter, and sub), in-group, alienation, status, input/output, infra-structure, ethnic, behavioral, consensus, and scores like them, tend to appear in almost every conversation and in almost everything we read.
    
    Consider the word "society" itself. What a chameleon-like word it is, what a host of adjectives can be placed in front of it, while throughout it continues to convey the broad notion of people living together rather than in isolation. We hear of the aberrant society, the abortive society, the acquiescent society, the acquisitive society, the affluent society, and we can continue on through the alphabet until we arrive at the zymotic society, which is one that is in a continuous state of ferment, not unlike our own.
    
    "Social," as an adjective, is also a word of many and familiar meanings. There is social power, social pressure, and social promise—and then, of course, there are the ubiquitous social problems. The last phrase, indeed, is a fine example of the specious ease that is involved in both the reading and the writing of social science literature. We would be willing to wager that in the last few months, if not the last few weeks, you have read and even possibly written the phrase "political, economic, and social problems." When you read or wrote it, you were probably clear as to what was meant by political and economic problems. But what did you, or the author, mean by social problems?
  - |-
    The jargon and metaphors of much social science writing, together with the deep feeling that often imbues it, make for deceivingly easy reading. The references are to matters that are readily familiar to the reader; indeed, he reads or hears about them almost daily. Furthermore, his attitudes and feelings regarding them are usually firmly developed. Philosophy, too, deals with the world as we commonly know it, but we are not ordinarily "committed" on philosophical questions. But on matters with which social science deals, we are likely to have strong opinions.
    
    Difficulties of Reading Social Science
    
    Paradoxically, the very factors we have discussed, the factors which make social science seem easy to read, also make it difficult to read. Consider the last factor mentioned, for instance—the commitment that you as a reader are likely to have to some view of the matter your author is considering. Many readers fear that it would be disloyal to their commitment to stand apart and impersonally question what they are reading. Yet this is necessary whenever you read analytically. Such a stance is implied by the rules of reading, at least by the rules of structural outlining and interpretation. If you are going to answer the first two questions that should be asked of anything you read, you must, as it were, check your opinions at the door. You cannot understand a book if you refuse to hear what it is saying.
    
    The very familiarity of the terms and propositions in social science writing is also an obstacle to understanding. Many social scientists recognize this themselves. They object vigorously to the use of more or less technical terms and concepts in popular journalism and other writings. An example of such a concept is that of the Gross National Product (GNP). In serious economic writing, the concept is employed in a relatively limited sense. But many reporters and columnists, some social scientists say, make the concept do too much work. They use it too widely, without really understanding what it means. Obviously, if the writer of something you are reading is confused about his use of a key term, you, as reader, must be so, too.
  - |-
    Let us try to make this point clear by drawing a distinction  
    302 HOW TO READ A BOOK  
    
    between the social sciences, on the one hand, and the so-called  
    hard sciences—physics, chemistry, and the like—on the other  
    hand. We have observed that the author of a scientific book  
    (taking "scientific" in the latter sense) makes clear what he  
    assumes and what he desires to prove, and also makes sure that  
    his terms and propositions are easy to spot. Since coming to  
    terms and finding the propositions is a main part of reading any  
    expository work, this means that much of the work is done for  
    you in the case of such books. You may still have difficulty  
    with the mathematical form of presentation; and if you do not  
    have a firm grasp of the arguments and of the experimental or  
    observational basis of the conclusions, you will find it hard to  
    criticize the book—that is, to answer the questions, Is it true?  
    and What of it? Nevertheless, there is an important sense in  
    which the reading of this kind of scientific books is easier than  
    the reading of most other kinds of expository works.  
    
    Another way to say what it is that the hard scientist does  
    is to say that he "stipulates his usage"—that is, he informs you  
    what terms are essential to his argument and how he is going  
    to use them. Such stipulations usually occur at the beginning  
    of the book, in the form of definitions, postulates, axioms, and  
    so forth. Since stipulation of usage is characteristic of these  
    fields, it has been said that they are like games or have a  
    "game structure." Stipulation of usage is like establishing the  
    rules of a game. If you want to play poker, you do not dispute  
    the rule that three of a kind is a better hand than two pairs;  
    if you want to play bridge, you do not argue with the conven-  
    tion that a queen takes a jack (in the same suit), or that the  
    highest trump takes any other card (in a suit contract). Simi-  
    larly, you do not dispute a hard scientist's stipulations in read-  
    ing his book. You accept them, and go on from there.
  - |-
    Until quite recently, at least, stipulation of usage was not  
    as common in the social sciences as it is in the hard sciences.  
    One reason for this is that the social sciences were typically  
    not mathematicized. Another is that stipulation of usage in the  
    social or behavioral sciences is harder to do. It is one thing to  
    define a circle or an isosceles triangle; it is quite another to  
    define an economic depression or mental health. Even if a  
    social scientist attempts to define such terms, his readers are  
    inclined to question his usage. As a result, the social scientist  
    must continue to struggle with his own terms throughout his  
    work—and his struggle creates problems for his reader.  
    
    The most important source of difficulty in reading social  
    science derives from the fact that this field of literature is a  
    mixed, rather than a pure, kind of expository writing. We have  
    seen how history is a mixture of fiction and science, and how  
    we must read it with that in mind. We are familiar with this  
    kind of mixture; we have had a great deal of experience with  
    it. The situation in social science is quite different. Much social  
    science is a mixture of science, philosophy, and history, often  
    with some fiction thrown in for good measure.  
    
    If social science were always the same kind of mixture,  
    we could become familiar with it as we have with history. But  
    this is far from the case. The mixture itself shifts from book to  
    book, and the reader is confronted with the task of identifying  
    the various strands that go to make up what he is reading.  
    These strands may change in the course of a single book as  
    well as in different books. It is no easy job to separate them out.
  - |-
    You will recall that the first step the analytical reader has  
    to take is to answer the question, What kind of book is this? In  
    the case of fiction, that question is relatively easy to answer. In  
    the case of science and philosophy, it is also relatively easy;  
    and even if history is a mixed form, at least the reader ordi-  
    narily knows that he is reading history. But the various strands  
    that go to make up social science—sometimes interwoven in  
    this pattern, sometimes in that, sometimes in still another—  
    make the question very hard to answer when we are reading  
    a work in any of the fields involved. The problem, in fact, is  
    precisely as difficult as the problem of defining social science.
    
    Nevertheless, the analytical reader must somehow manage  
    to answer the question. It is not only his first task, but also his  
    most important. If he is able to say what strands go to make  
    up the book he is reading, he will have moved a good way  
    toward understanding it.
    
    Outlining a work in social science poses no special prob-  
    lems, but coming to terms with the author, as we have already  
    suggested, may be extremely difficult, owing to the relative  
    inability of the author to stipulate his usage. Nevertheless, some  
    common understanding of the key terms is usually possible. From terms we move to propositions and arguments, and here  
    again there is no special problem if the book is a good one. But the last question, What of it?, requires considerable re-  
    straint on the part of the reader. It is here that the situation  
    we described earlier may occur—namely, the situation in which  
    the reader says, "I cannot fault the author's conclusions, but  
    I nevertheless disagree with them." This comes about, of course,  
    because of the prejudgments that the reader is likely to have  
    concerning the author's approach and his conclusions.
    
    Reading Social Science Literature
  - |-
    More than once in the course of this chapter we have em-
    ployed the phrase "social science literature" instead of "social
    science book." The reason is that it is customary in social sci-
    ence to read several books about a subject rather than one
    book for its own sake. This is not only because social science
    is a relatively new field with as yet but few classic texts. It is
    also because when reading social science, we often have our
    eye primarily on a particular matter or problem, rather than
    on a particular author or book. We are interested in law en-
    forcement, for example, and we read half a dozen works on
    the subject. Or our interest may concern race relations, or
    education, or taxation, or the problems of local government.
    Typically, there is no single, authoritative work on any of these
    subjects, and we must therefore read several. One sign of this
    is that social science authors themselves, in order to keep up
    with the times, must constantly bring out new, revised editions
    of their works; and new works supersede older ones and rap-
    idly render them obsolete.
    
    To some extent, a similar situation obtains in philosophy,
    as we have already observed. Fully to understand a philoso-
    pher, you should make some attempt to read the philosophers
    your author himself has read, the philosophers who have in-
    fluenced him. To some extent it is also true in history, where
    we suggested that, if you want to discover the truth of the past,
    you had better read several books about it rather than one.
    But in those cases the likelihood that you would find one
    major, authoritative work was much greater. In social science
    that is not so common, and so the necessity of reading several
    works rather than one is much more urgent.
  - |-
    The rules of analytical reading are not in themselves applicable to the reading of several works on the same subject. They apply to each of the works that is read, of course, and if you want to read any of them well you have to observe them. But new rules of reading are required as we pass from the third level of reading (analytical reading) to the fourth (syntopical reading). We are now prepared to tackle that fourth level, having come to see, because of this characteristic of social science, the need for it.
    
    Pointing this out makes it clear why we relegated the discussion of the social sciences to the last chapter in Part Three. It should now be clear why we organized the discussion in the way we did. We began with the reading of practical books, which are different from all others because of the special obligation to act that the reader is under if he agrees with and accepts what he is reading. We then treated fiction and poetry, which pose special problems that are unlike those of expository books. Finally, we dealt with three types of theoretical, expository writing—science and mathematics, philosophy, and social science. Social science came last because of the need to read it syntopically. Thus the present chapter serves as both the end of Part Three and an introduction to Part Four.

    THE FOURTH LEVEL OF READING:
    SYNTOPICAL READING
    
    So far we have not said anything specific about how to read two or more books on the same subject. We have tried to suggest that when certain subjects are discussed, more than one book is relevant, and we have also from time to time mentioned, in a very informal way, certain related books and authors in various fields. Knowing that more than one book is relevant to a particular question is the first requirement in any project of syntopical reading. Knowing which books should be read, in a general way, is the second requirement. The second requirement is a great deal harder to satisfy than the first.
  - |-
    The difficulty becomes evident as soon as we examine the
    phrase "two or more books on the same subject." What do we
    mean by "same subject"? Perhaps this is clear enough when
    the subject is a single historical period or event, but in hardly
    any other sphere is there much clarity to be found. Gone With
    the Wind and War and Peace are both novels about a great
    war—but there, for the most part, the resemblance stops. Stend-
    hal's The Charterhouse of Parma is "about" the same conflict—
    that is, the Napoleonic Wars—that Tolstoy's novel is "about."
    But of course neither is about the war, or indeed about war in
    general, as such. War provides the context or background of
    both stories—as it does for much of human life—but it is the
    stories on which the authors rivet our attention. We may leam
    
    309
    
    310 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    something about the war—in fact, Tolstoy once said that he had
    learned much of what he knew about battles from Stendhal's
    account of the Battle of Waterloo—but we do not go to these
    novels or any others if our primary intention is to study war.
    
    You could have anticipated that this situation would ob-
    tain in the case of fiction. It is inherent in the fact that the
    novelist does not communicate in the same way that an exposi-
    tory writer does. But the situation obtains in the case of ex-
    pository works, as well.
    
    Suppose, for example, that you are interested in reading
    about the idea of love. Since the literature of love is vast, you
    would have relatively little difficulty in creating a bibliography
    of books to read. Suppose that you have done that, by asking
    advisors, by searching through the card catalogue of a good
    library, and by examining the bibliography in a good scholarly
    treatise on the subject. And suppose in addition that you have
    confined yourself to expository works, despite the undoubted
    interest of novelists and poets in the subject. (We will explain
    why it would be advisable to do this later.) You now begin to
    examine the books in your bibliography. What do you find?
  - |-
    Even a cursory perusal reveals a very great range of reference. There is hardly a single human action that has not been called—in one way or another—an act of love. Nor is the range confined to the human sphere. If you proceed far enough in your reading, you will find that love has been attributed to almost everything in the universe; that is, everything that exists has been said by someone either to love or to be loved—or both.
    
    Stones are said to love the center of the earth. The upward motion of fire is called a function of its love. The attraction of iron filings to a magnet is described as an effect of love. Tracts have been written on the love life of amoebae, paramecia, snails, and ants, to say nothing of most of the so-called higher animals, who are said to love their masters as well as one another. When we come to human beings, we discover that authors speak and write of their love for men, women, a woman, a man, children, themselves, mankind, money, art, domesticity, principles, a cause, an occupation or profession, adventure, security, ideas,
    
    The Fourth Level of Reading: Syntopica! Reading 311
    
    a country life, loving itself, a beefsteak, or wine. In certain learned treatises, the motions of the heavenly bodies are said to be inspired by love; in others, angels and devils are differentiated by the quality of their love. And of course God is said to be Love.
  - |-
    Confronted with this enormous range of reference, how  
    are we to state what the subject is that we are investigating?  
    Can we even be sure that there is a single subject? When one  
    person says "I love cheese," and another says "I love football,"  
    and a third says "I love mankind," are they all three using the  
    word in any sense that is common? After all, one eats cheese  
    but not football or mankind, one plays football but not cheese  
    or mankind, and whatever "I love mankind" means, that mean-  
    ing does not seem to be applicable to cheese or football. And  
    yet all three do use the same word. Is there in fact some deep  
    reason for that, some reason that is not immediately apparent  
    on the surface? Difficult as that question is, can we say that  
    we have identified the "same subject" until we have answered  
    it?
    
    Faced with this chaotic situation, you may decide to limit  
    the enquiry to human love—to love between human beings, of  
    the same sex or different sexes, of the same age or different  
    ages, and so forth. That would rule out the three statements we  
    have just discussed. But you would still find, even if you read  
    only a small portion of the available books about the subject,  
    a very great range of reference. You would find, for instance,  
    that love is said by some writers to consist wholly in acquisitive  
    desire, usually sexual desire; that is, love is merely a name for  
    the attraction that almost all animals feel toward members of  
    the opposite sex. But you would also find other authors who  
    maintain that love, properly speaking, contains no acquisitive  
    desire whatever, and consists in pure benevolence. Do acquisi-  
    tive desire and benevolence have anything in common, consid-  
    ering that acquisitive desire always implies wanting some good  
    for oneself, while benevolence implies wanting a good for  
    someone else?  
    
    At least acquisitive desire and benevolence share' a com-  
    (312 HOW TO READ A BOOK)
  - |-
    My note on tendency, of desire in some very abstract sense of the term. But your investigation of the literature of the subject would soon uncover writers who conceive of the essence of love as being cognitive rather than appetitive. Love, these writers maintain, is an intellectual act, not an emotional one. In other words, knowing that another person is admirable always precedes desiring him or her, in either of the two senses of desire. Such authors do not deny that desire enters into the picture, but they do deny that desire should be called love.
  - |-
    Let us suppose—in fact, we think it can be done—that you are able to identify some common meaning in these various conceptions of human love. Even then not all of your problems are solved. Consider the ways in which love manifests itself between and among human beings. Is the love that a man and woman have for each other the same when they are courting as when they are married, the same when they are in their twenties as when they are in their seventies? Is the love that a woman has for her husband the same as that she has for her children? Does a mother's love for her children change as they grow up? Is the love of a brother for his sister the same as his love for his father? Does a child's love for its parents change as he or she grows? Is the love that a man has for a woman, either his wife or some other, the same as the friendship he feels for another man, and does it make a difference what relationship he has with the man—such as one with whom he goes bowling, one with whom he works, and one whose intellectual company he enjoys? Does the fact that "love" and "friendship" are different words mean that the emotions they name (if that is in fact what they name) differ? Can two men of different ages be friends? Can they be friends if they are markedly different in some other respect, such as possession of wealth or degree of intelligence? Can women be friends at all? Can brothers and sisters be friends, or brother and brother, or sister and sister? Can you retain a friendship with someone you either borrow money from or lend it to? It not, why not? Can a boy love his teacher? Does it make a difference whether the teacher is male or female? If humanoid robots existed, could human beings love them? If we discovered intelligent beings on Mars or some other planet, could we love them? Can we love someone we have never met, like a movie star or the President? If we feel that we hate someone, is that really an expression of love?
  - |-
    These are just a few of the questions that would be raised by your reading of even a part of the standard expository literature of love. There are many other questions that could be asked. However, we think we have made the point. A curious paradox is involved in any project of syntopical reading. Although this level of reading is defined as the reading of two or more books on the same subject, which implies that the identification of the subject matter occurs before the reading begins, it is in a sense true that the identification of the subject matter must follow the reading, not precede it. In the case of love, you might have to read a dozen or a hundred works before you could decide what you were reading about. And when you had done that, you might have to conclude that half of the works you had read were not on the subject at all.
    
    The Role of Inspection in Syntopical Reading
    
    We have stated more than once that the levels of reading are cumulative, that a higher level includes all of those that precede or lie below it. It is now time to explain what that means in the case of syntopical reading.
    
    You will recall that in explaining the relationship between inspectional reading and analytical reading, we pointed out that the two steps in inspectional reading—first, skimming; and second, superficial reading—anticipated the first two steps in analytical reading. Skimming helps to prepare you for the first step of analytical reading, in the course of which you identify the subject matter of whatever you are reading, state what kind of book it is, and outline its structure. Superficial reading, while it is also helpful in that first step of analytical reading, is primarily a preparation for the second step, when you are called upon to interpret a book's contents by coming to terms with the author, stating his propositions, and following his arguments.
    
    In a somewhat analogous fashion, both inspectional and analytical reading can be considered as anticipations or preparations for syntopical reading. It is here, in fact, that inspectional reading comes into its own as a major tool or instrument for the reader.
  - |-
    Let us suppose once more that you have a bibliography of a hundred or so titles, all of which appear to be on the subject of love. If you read every one of them analytically, you would not only end up with a fairly clear idea of the subject that you were investigating—the "same subject" of the syntopical reading project—but you would also know which, if any, of the books you had read were not on that subject and thus irrelevant to your needs. But to read a hundred books analytically might well take you ten years. If you were able to devote full time to the project, it would still take many months. Some short cut is obviously necessary, in the face of the paradox we have mentioned concerning syntopical reading.
    
    That short cut is provided by your skill in inspectional reading. The first thing to do when you have amassed your bibliography is to inspect all of the books on your list. You should not read any of them analytically before inspecting all of them. Inspectional reading will not acquaint you with all of the intricacies of the subject matter, or with all of the insights that your authors can provide, but it will perform two essential functions. First, it will give you a clear enough idea of your subject so that your subsequent analytical reading of some of the books on the list is productive. And second, it will allow you to cut down your bibliography to a more manageable size.
    
    We can hardly think of any advice that would be more useful for students, especially graduate and research students, than this, if they would only heed it. In our experience, a certain number of students at those advanced levels of schooling

    Here is the text with formatting errors fixed and original content preserved:
    
    There may not be enough of them, and they may be far from perfect readers, but they at least know how to get at the meat of a book, to make reasonably intelligible statements about it, and to fit it into a plot or plan of their subject matter. But their efforts are enormously wasteful because they do not understand how to read some books faster than others. They spend the same amount of time and effort on every book or article they read. As a result, they do not read those books that deserve a really good reading as well as they deserve, and they waste time on works that deserve less attention.
    
    The skillful inspectional reader does more than classify a book in his mental card catalogue, and achieve a superficial knowledge of its contents. He also discovers, in the very short time it takes him to inspect it, whether the book says something important about his subject or not. He may not yet know what that something is precisely—that discovery will probably have to wait for another reading. But he has learned one of two things. Either the book is one to which he must return for light, or it is one that, no matter how enjoyable or informative, contains no enlightenment and therefore does not have to be read again.
    
    There is a reason why this advice is often unheeded. In the case of analytical reading, we said that the skillful reader performs concurrently steps that the beginner must treat as separate. By analogy, it might seem that this kind of preparation for syntopical reading—the inspection of all of the books on your list before starting the analytical reading of any of them—could be done concurrently with analytical reading. But we do not believe that can be done by any reader, no matter how skillful. And this indeed is the mistake that so many younger researchers make. Thinking they can collapse these two steps into one, they end up reading everything at the same rate, which may be either too fast or too slow for a particular work, but in any event is wrong for most of the books they read.
    
    Once you have identified, by inspection, the books that are

    relevant to your subject matter, you can then proceed to read
    them syntopically. Note that in the last sentence we did not
    say "proceed to read them analytically," as you might have
    expected. In a sense, of course, you do have to read each of the
    individual works that, together, constitute the literature of
    your subject, with those skills that you acquired by applying
    the rules of analytical reading, But it must never be forgotten
    that the art of analytical reading applies to the reading of a
    single book, when understanding of that book is the aim in
    view. As we will see, the aim in syntopical reading is quite
    different.
    
    The Five Steps in Syntopical Reading
    
    We are now prepared to explain how to read syntopically.
    We will assume that, by your inspection of a number of books,
    you have a pretty good idea of the subject that at least some
    of them are about, and furthermore that this is the subject you
    want to investigate. What, then, do you do?
    
    There are five steps in syntopical reading. We shall not
    call them rules, although we might, for if any of the steps is
    not taken, syntopical reading becomes much more difficult,
    perhaps impossible. We will discuss them roughly in the order
    in which they occur, although in a sense all of them have to
    take place for any of them to.
    
    Step 1 in Syntopical Reading: FINDING THE RELEVANT
    Passages. Since we are of course assuming that you know how
    to read analytically, we are assuming that you could read each
    of the relevant books thoroughly if you wanted to. But that
    would be to place the individual books first in the order of
    your priorities, and your problem second. In fact, the order is
    reversed. In syntopical reading, it is you and your concerns
    that are primarily to be served, not the books that you read.
    
    Hence the first step at this level of reading is another in-

    specification of the whole works that you have identified as rele-
    vant. Your aim is to find the passages in the books that are most
    germane to your needs. It is unlikely that the whole of any of
    the books is directly on the subject you have chosen or that
    is troubling you. Even if this is so, as it very rarely is, you
    should read the book quickly. You do not want to lose sight
    of the fact that you are reading it for an ulterior purpose—
    namely, for the light it may throw on your own problem—not
    for its own sake.
    
    It might seem that this step could be taken concurrently
    with the previously described inspection of the book, the pur-
    pose of which was to discover whether the book was at all
    relevant to your concerns. In many cases, that is so. But it is
    unwise to consider that this is always possible. Remember that
    one of the aims of your first inspection of the book was to zero
    in on the subject matter of your syntopical reading project. We
    have said that an adequate understanding of the problem is not
    always available until you have inspected many of the books
    on your original list. Therefore, to try to identify the relevant
    passages at the same time that you identify the relevant books
    is often perilous. Unless you are very skillful, or already quite
    familiar with your subject, you had better treat the two steps
    as separate.
    
    What is important here is to recognize the difference be-
    tween the first books that you read in the course of syntopical
    reading, and those that you come to after you have read many
    others on the subject. In the case of the later books, you prob-
    ably already have a fairly clear idea of your problem, and in
    that case the two steps can coalesce. But at the beginning,
    they should be kept rigorously separated. Otherwise, you are
    likely to make serious mistakes in identifying the relevant pas-
    sages, mistakes that will have to be corrected later with a con-
    sequent waste of time and effort.
    
    Above all, remember that your task is not so much to
    achieve an overall understanding of the particular book before
    you as to find out how it can be useful to you in a connection

    that may be very far from the author's own purpose in writing. That does not matter at this stage of the proceedings. The author can help you to solve your own problem without having intended to. In syntopical reading, as we have noted, the books that are read serve you, not the other way around. In this sense, syntopical reading is the most active reading you can do. Analytical reading is also active, of course. But when you read a book analytically, you put yourself in a relation to it of disciple to master. When you read syntopically, you must be the master of the situation.
    
    Because this is so, you must go about the business of coming to terms with your authors in a somewhat different way than before.
    
    STEP 2 IN SYNTOPICAL READING: BRINGING THE AUTHORS TO TERMS. In interpretive reading (the second stage of analytical reading) the first rule requires you to come to terms with the author, which means identifying his key words and discovering how he uses them. But now you are faced with a number of different authors, and it is unlikely that they will have all used the same words, or even the same terms. Thus it is you who must establish the terms, and bring your authors to them rather than the other way around.
    
    This is probably the most difficult step in syntopical reading. What it really comes down to is forcing an author to use your language, rather than using his. All of our normal reading habits are opposed to this. As we have pointed out several times, we assume that the author of a book we want to read analytically is our better, and this is particularly true if the book is a great one. Our tendency is to accept the author's terms and his organization of the subject matter, no matter how active we may be in trying to understand him. In syntopical reading, however, we will very quickly be lost if we accept any one author's terminology. We may understand his book, but we will fail to understand the others, and we will find that not much light is shed on the subject in which we are interested.
  - |-

    Not only must we resolutely refuse to accept the terminology of any one author; we must also be willing to face the possibility that no author's terminology will be useful to us.
    In other words, we must accept the fact that coincidence of terminology between us and any of the authors on our list is merely accidental. Often, indeed, such coincidence will be inconvenient; for if we use one term or set of terms of an author, we may be tempted to use others among his terms, and these may get in the way rather than help.
    
    Syntopical reading, in short, is to a large extent an exercise in translation. We do not have to translate from one natural language to another, as from French to English. But we do impose a common terminology on a number of authors who, whatever natural language they may have shared in common, may not have been specifically concerned with the problem we are trying to solve, and therefore may not have created the ideal terminology for dealing with it.
    
    This means that as we proceed on our project of syntopical reading we must begin to build up a set of terms that first, helps us to understand all of our authors, not just one or a few of them, and second, helps us to solve our problem. That insight leads to the third step.
    
    STEP 3 IN SYNTOPICAL READING: GETTING THE QUESTIONS
    Cear, The second rule of interpretive reading requires us to find the author's key sentences, and from them to develop an understanding of his propositions. Propositions are made up of terms, and of course we must do a similar job on the works we are reading syntopically. But since we ourselves are establishing the terminology in this case, we are faced with the task of establishing a set of neutral propositions as well. The best way to do this is to frame a set of questions that shed light on our problem, and to which each of our authors gives answers.
    
    This, too, is difficult. The questions must be stated in such a way and in such an order that they help us to solve the problem we started with, but they also must be framed in such a way that all or most of our authors can be interpreted as giv-
  - |-

    Answering the questions. The difficulty is that the questions we
    want answered may not have been seen as questions by the
    authors. Their view of the subject may have been quite differ-
    ent from ours.
    
    Sometimes, indeed, we have to accept the fact that an
    author gives no answer to one or more of our questions. In that
    case, we must record him as silent or indeterminate on the
    question. But even if he does not discuss the question expli-
    citly, we can sometimes find an implicit answer in his book.
    If he had considered the question, we may conclude, he would
    then have answered it in such and such a way. Restraint is
    necessary here; we cannot put thoughts into our authors'
    minds, or words into their mouths. But we also cannot depend
    entirely on their explicit statements about the problem. If we
    could depend on any one of them in that way, we probably
    would have no problem to solve.
    
    We have said that the questions must be put in an order
    that is helpful to us in our investigation. The order depends on
    the subject, of course, but some general directions can be sug-
    gested. The first questions usually have to do with the existence
    or character of the phenomenon or idea we are investigating.
    If an author says that the phenomenon exists or that the idea
    has a certain character, then we may ask further questions of
    his book. These may have to do with how the phenomenon is
    known or how the idea manifests itself. A final set of questions
    might have to do with the consequences of the answers to the
    previous questions.
    
    We should not expect that all of our authors will answer
    our questions in the same way. If they did, we would once
    again have no problem to solve; it would have been solved by
    consensus. Since the authors will differ, we are faced with hav-
    ing to take the next step in syntopical reading.
    
    STEP 4 in SyNToPICAL READING: DEFINING THE Issues. If
    a question is clear, and if we can be reasonably certain that
    authors answer it in different ways—perhaps pro and con—then
  - |-
    An issue has been defined. It is the issue between the authors
    who answer the question in one way, and those who answer it
    in one or another opposing way.
    
    When only two answers are given by all of the authors
    examined, the issue is a relatively simple one. Often, more than
    two alternative answers are given to a question. In that case,
    the opposing answers must be ordered in relation to one an-
    other, and the authors who adopt them classified according to
    their views.
    
    An issue is truly joined when two authors who understand
    a question in the same way answer it in contrary or contradic-
    tory ways. But this does not happen as often as one might
    wish. Usually, differences in answers must be ascribed to dif-
    ferent conceptions of the question as often as to different views
    of the subject. The task of the syntopical reader is to define
    the issues in such a way as to insure that they are joined as
    well as may be. Sometimes this forces him to frame the ques-
    tion in a way that is not explicitly employed by any author.
    
    There may be many issues involved in the discussion of
    the problem we are dealing with, but it is likely that they will
    fall into groups. Questions about the character of the idea
    under consideration, for example, may generate a number of
    issues that are connected. A number of issues revolving around
    a closely connected set of questions may be termed the contro-
    versy about that aspect of the subject. Such a controversy may
    be very complicated, and it is the task of the syntopical reader
    to sort it out and arrange it in an orderly and perspicuous
    fashion, even if no author has managed to do that. This sorting
    and arranging of the controversies, as well as of the constituent
    issues, brings us to the final step in syntopical reading,
    
    STEP 5 IN SYNTOPICAL READING: ANALYZING THE Discussion.
    So far we have found the relevant passages in the works
    examined, created a neutral terminology that applies to all or
    most of the authors examined, framed and ordered a set of
    questions that most of them can be interpreted as answering,
    and defined and arranged the issues produced by differing an-
    swers to the questions. What then remains to be done?
  - |-
    The first four steps correspond to the first two groups of  
    rules for analytical reading. Those rules, when followed and  
    applied to any book, allowed us to answer the questions, What  
    does it say? and How does it say it? In our syntopical reading  
    project, we are similarly able at this point to answer the same  
    questions about the discussion concerning our problem. In the  
    case of the analytical reading of a single work, two further  
    questions remained to be answered, namely, Is it true? and  
    What of it? In the case of syntopical reading, we are now pre-  
    pared to address ourselves to similar questions about the dis-  
    cussion.
    
    Let us assume that the problem with which we began was  
    not a simple one, but was rather one of those perennial prob-  
    lems with which thinkers have struggled for centuries, and  
    about which good men have disagreed and can continue to  
    disagree. We should recognize, on this assumption, that our  
    task as syntopical readers is not merely to answer the questions  
    ourselves—the questions that we have so carefully framed and  
    ordered both to elucidate the discussion of the subject and the  
    subject itself. The truth about a problem of this sort is not  
    found so easily. In fact, we would probably be presumptuous  
    to expect that the truth could be found in any one set of  
    answers to the questions. Rather, it is to be found, if at all, in  
    the conflict of opposing answers, many if not all of which may  
    have persuasive evidence and convincing reasons to support  
    them.
    
    The truth, then, insofar as it can be found—the solution to  
    the problem, insofar as that is available to us—consists rather  
    in the ordered discussion itself than in any set of propositions  
    or assertions about it. Thus, in order to present this truth to  
    our minds—and to the minds of others—we have to do more  
    than merely ask and answer the questions. We have to ask  
    them in a certain order, and be able to defend that order; we  
    must show how the questions are answered differently and
  - |-
    Try to say why; and we must be able to point to the texts in
    the books examined that support our classification of answers.
    Only when we have done all of this can we claim to have
    analyzed the discussion of our problem. And only then can we
    claim to have understood it.
    
    We may, indeed, have done more than that. A thorough
    analysis of the discussion of a problem may provide the
    groundwork for further productive work on the problem by
    others. It can clear away the deadwood and prepare the way
    for an original thinker to make a breakthrough. Without the
    work of analysis, that might not have been possible, for the
    dimensions of the problem might not have been visible.
    
    The Need for Objectivity
    
    An adequate analysis of the discussion of a problem or
    subject matter identifies and reports the major issues, or basic
    intellectual oppositions, in that discussion. This does not imply
    that disagreement is always the dominant feature of every
    discussion. On the contrary, agreement in most cases accom-
    panies disagreement; that is, on most issues, the opinions or
    views that present opposite sides of the dispute are shared by
    several authors, often by many. Seldom do we find a solitary
    exponent of a controversial position.
    
    The agreement of human beings about the nature of
    things in any field of inquiry establishes some presumption of
    the truth of the opinions they commonly hold. But their dis-
    agreement establishes the counter-presumption—that none of
    the opinions in conflict, whether shared or not, may be wholly
    true. Among conflicting opinions, one may, of course, be
    wholly true and all the rest false; but it is also possible that
    each expresses some portion of the whole truth; and, except
    for flat and isolated contradictions (which are rare in any dis-
    cussion of the kind of problems we are dealing with here), it
    is even possible that all the conflicting opinions may be false,
    just as it is possible for that opinion to be false on which all
    seem to agree. Some opinion as yet unexpressed may be the
    truth or nearer to it.
  - |-
    This is another way of saying that the aim of a project of syntopical reading is not final answers to the questions that are developed in the course of it, or the final solution of the problem with which the project began. This is particularly true of the report we might try to make of such syntopical reading. It would be dogmatic, not dialectical, if, on any of the important issues that it identified and analyzed, it asserted or tried to prove the truth or falsity of any view. If it did that, the syntopical analysis would cease to be syntopical; it would become simply one more voice in the discussion, thereby losing its detached and objective character.
    
    The point is not that one more voice carries no weight in the forum of human discussion on important issues. The point is that a different type of contribution to the pursuit of understanding can and should be made. And this contribution consists in being resolutely objective and detached throughout. The special quality that a syntopical analysis tries to achieve can, indeed, be summarized in the two words "dialectical objectivity."
    
    The syntopical reader, in short, tries to look at all sides and to take no sides. Of course, he will fail in this exacting ideal. Absolute objectivity is not humanly possible. He may succeed in taking no sides, presenting the issues without prejudice to any partisan point of view, and treating opposing views impartially. But it is easier to take no sides than to look at all sides. In this latter respect, the syntopical reader will undoubtedly fail. All possible sides of an issue cannot be exhaustively enumerated. Nevertheless, he must try.
    
    Taking no sides is easier than looking at all sides, we say, but it remains difficult even so. The syntopical reader must resist certain temptations and know his own mind. Perfect dialectical objectivity is not guaranteed by avoiding explicit judgments on the truth of conflicting opinions. Partiality can intrude in a variety of subtle ways—by the manner in which
  - |-

    arguments are summarized, by shades of emphasis and neglect,
    by the tone of a question or the color of a passing remark, and
    by the order in which the various different answers to key
    questions are presented.
    
    In order to avoid some of these dangers, the conscientious
    syntopical reader may resort to one obvious device and use it
    as much as possible. That is, he must constantly refer back to
    the actual text of his authors, reading the relevant passages
    over and over; and, in presenting the results of his work to a
    wider audience, he must quote the opinion or argument of an
    author in the writer's own language. Although it may appear
    to do so, this does not contradict what we said earlier about
    the necessity of finding a neutral terminology in which to
    analyze the problem. That necessity remains, and when sum-
    maries of an author's argument are presented, they must be
    presented in that language and not the author's. But the
    author's own words, carefully quoted so as not to wrench them
    out of context, must accompany the summary, so that the reader
    can judge for himself whether the interpretation of the author
    is correct.
    
    Only the syntopical reader's firm intention to avoid them
    can be relied on to prevent other sorts of departure from dia-
    lectical objectivity. That ideal demands a deliberate effort to
    balance question against question, to forgo any comment that
    might be prejudicial, to check any tendency toward overem-
    phasis or underemphasis. In the last analysis, although a
    reader may be the judge of the effectiveness of a written report
    of a dialectical exposition, only the writer of it—only the syn-
    topical reader himself—can know whether he has satisfied these
    requirements.
    
    An Example of an Exercise in Syntopical Reading:
    The Idea of Progress
    
    An example may be helpful to explain how syntopical
    reading works. Let us consider the idea of progress. We do not
    take this subject at random. We have done extensive research
    on it.* The example would not be so useful to you if that were
    not so.
  - |-
    The investigation of this important historical and philosophical idea occupied several years. The first task was to produce a list of works to be examined for relevant passages—to amass a bibliography (it finally ran to more than 450 items). This task was accomplished by a series of inspectional readings of several times that many books, articles, and other pieces. It is important to point out that in the case of the idea of progress, as would be true in the case of most other important ideas, many of the items finally judged to be relevant were found more or less by accident, or at least with the help of educated guesses. There were obvious places to start; many recent books contain the word "progress" in their titles. But others do not, and most of the older books, although relevant to the subject, do not even employ the term.
    
    A few fictional and poetical works were read, but on the whole it was decided to concentrate on expository works. We have already observed that including novels, plays, and poems in a syntopical reading project is difficult, and this is so for several reasons. First of all, the backbone or essence of a story is its plot, not its positions on issues. Second, even the most talkative characters seldom take clear positions on an issue—they tend to talk, in the story, about other matters, mainly emotional relations. Third, even if a character does make such a speech—as, for example, Settembrini does about progress in Thomas Mann's *Magic Mountain*—we can never be sure that it is the author's view that is being represented. Is the author being ironic in allowing his character to go on about the subject? Is he intending you to see the foolishness of the position?
    
    * The results of these researches were published as *The Idea of Progress*, New York: Praeger, 1967. The work was done under the auspices of the Institute for Philosophical Research, of which the authors are respectively Director and Associate Director.

    tion, rather than its wisdom? Generally speaking, an intensive
    effort of synthetic interpretation is required before a fictional
    work can be placed on one side or another of an issue. The
    effort is so great, and the results essentially so dubious, that
    usually it is prudent to abstain.
    
    The discussion of progress in the many works that re-
    mained to be examined was, as is usually the case, apparently
    chaotic. Faced with this fact, the task was, as we have indi-
    cated, to develop a neutral terminology. This was a complex
    undertaking, but one example may help to explain what was
    done.
    
    The word "progress" itself is used by authors in a number
    of different ways. Most of these different ways reflect no more
    than shades of meaning, and they can be handled in the analy-
    sis. But the word is used by some authors to denote a certain
    kind of movement forward in history that is not an improve-
    ment. Since most of the authors use the word to denote a
    historical change in the human condition that is for the better,
    and since betterment is of the essence of the conception, the
    same word could not be applied to both views. In this case,
    the majority gained the day, and the minority faction had to
    be referred to as authors who assert "non-meliorative advance"
    in history. The point is that when discussing the views of the
    minority faction, we could not employ the word "progress,"
    even though the authors involved had used it themselves.
    
    The third step in syntopical reading is, as we have noted,
    getting the questions clear. Our intuition about the primary
    question in the case of progress turned out to be correct upon
    examination. The first question to ask, the question to which
    authors can be interpreted as giving various answers, is, Does
    progress occur in history? Is it a fact that the general course of
    historical change is in the direction of improvement in man's
    condition? Basically, there are three different answers to this
    question put forth in the literature of the subject: (1) Yes,
    (2) No, and (3) We cannot know. However, there are a num-
    ber of different ways of saying Yes, several different ways of
  - |-

    saying No, and at least three different ways of saying that we
    cannot know whether human progress occurs or not.
    
    The multifarious and interrelated answers to this primary
    question constitute what we decided to call the general con-
    troversy about progress. It is general in the sense that every
    author we studied who has anything significant to say about
    the subject takes sides on the various issues that can be identi-
    fied within it. But there is also a special controversy about
    progress, which is made up of issues that are joined only by
    progress authors—authors who assert that progress occurs.
    These issues have to do with the nature or properties of the
    progress that they all, being progress authors, assert is a fact
    of history. There are only three issues here, although the dis-
    cussion of each of them is complex. They can be stated as
    questions: (1) Is progress necessary, or is it contingent on
    other occurrences? (2) Will progress continue indefinitely, or
    will it eventually come to an end or "plateau out"? (3) Is
    there progress in human nature as well as in human institutions
    —in the human animal itself, or merely in the external condi-
    tions of human life?
    
    Finally, there is a set of subordinate issues, as we called
    them, again only among progress authors, about the respects
    in which progress occurs. We identified six areas in which
    progress is said by some authors to occur, although other
    writers deny its occurrence in one or more of these areas—
    although never in all (since they are by definition authors who
    assert the occurrence of some kind of progress). The six are:
    (1) progress in knowledge, (2) technological progress, (3)
    economic progress, (4) political progress, (5) moral progress,
    and (6) progress in the fine arts. The discussion of the last
    point raises special problems, since in our opinion no author
    genuinely asserts that such aesthetic progress occurs, although
    a number of writers deny that progress occurs in this respect.
    
    The structure of the analysis of progress just described
    exemplifies our effort to define the issues within the discussion
    of this subject and to analyze the discussion itself—in other

    words, to take the fourth and fifth steps in syntopical reading.
    And something like this must always be done by a syntopical
    reader, although of course he does not always have to write a
    long book reporting his researches.*
    
    The Syntopicon and How to Use It
    
    If you read this chapter carefully, you will have noticed
    that, although we spent some time discussing it, we did not
    really solve what we called the paradox of syntopical reading.
    That paradox can be stated thus: Unless you know what
    books to read, you cannot read syntopically, but unless you can
    read syntopically, you do not know what to read. Another way
    to state it is in the form of what may be called the fundamental
    problem of syntopical reading, namely, that if you do not know
    where to start, you cannot read syntopically; and even if you
    have a rough idea of where to begin, the time required to find
    the relevant books and relevant passages in those books may
    exceed the time required to take all of the other steps com-
    bined.
    
    Actually, of course, there is at least a theoretical resolu-
    tion of the paradox and solution of the problem. Theoretically,
    you could know the major literature of our tradition so thor-
    oughly that you had a working notion of where every idea is
    discussed in it. But if you are such a person, you need no help
    from anybody, and we cannot tell you anything you do not
    know about syntopical reading.
    
    On the other hand, even if you did not have this knowl-
    
    * Now that such a book has been written and published, we hope that it
    will indeed make possible a breakthrough in thought such as we en-
    visaged as the fruit of syntopical reading, and that the book on progress
    may facilitate further work in its field, as other books produced by the
    Institute for Philosophical Research on the ideas of freedom, happiness,
    justice, and love have done in theirs—work that was inordinately difficult
    before these books appeared.

    Edge yourself, you might be able to apply to someone else who did. But you should recognize that if you were able to apply to such a person, his advice might turn out to be almost as much a hindrance as a help. If the subject was one on which he had himself done special research, it would be hard for him merely to tell you the relevant passages to read without telling you how to read them—and that might well get in your way. But if he had not done special research on the subject, he might not know a great deal more than yourself, although it might seem so both to him and to you.
    
    What is needed, therefore, is a reference book that tells you where to go to find the relevant passages on a large number of subjects of interest, without at the same time saying how the passages should be read—without prejudging their meaning or significance. The Syntopicon is an example of such a work. Produced in the 1940's, it is a topical index to the set of books titled Great Books of the Western World. Under each of some 3,000 topics or subjects, it lists references to pages within the set where that subject is discussed. Some of the references are to passages covering many pages, others are to key paragraphs or even parts of paragraphs. No more time is required to find them than is needed to take down the indicated volume and flip through its pages.
  - |-
    The Syntopicon has one major defect, of course. It is an
    index of just one set of books (albeit a large one), and it gives
    only a very rough indication of where passages may be found
    in other books that are not included in the set. Nevertheless, it
    always provides you with at least a place to start on any syn-
    topical reading project. And it is also true that the books in-
    cluded in the set are ones that you would almost always want
    to read anyway, in the course of any such project. Thus the
    Syntopicon should be able to save the mature scholar or reader
    who is beginning his research into a certain problem much of
    the preliminary labor of research, and advance him rapidly to
    the point where he can begin to think independently about it,
    because he knows what thinking has been done.
    
    The Fourth Level of Reading: Syntopical Reading 331
    
    Useful as the Syntopicon is for that kind of reader, it is
    much more useful for the beginner. The Syntopicon can help
    such a reader in three ways: initiatively, suggestively, and in-
    structively.
    
    It works initiatively by overcoming the initial difficulty
    that anyone faces when confronted by the classical books of
    our tradition. These works are a little overpowering. We may
    wish that we had read them, but often we do not do so. We
    find ourselves advised from all sides to read them, and we are
    given reading programs, beginning with the easier works and
    proceeding to the more difficult ones. But all such programs
    require the reading of whole books or, at least, the integral
    reading of large parts of them. It is a matter of general experi-
    ence that this kind of solution seldom achieves the desired
    result.
    
    A syntopical reading of these major works with the aid of
    the Syntopicon provides a radically different solution. The
    Syntopicon initiates the reading of great books by enabling
    persons to read particular ones on the subjects in which they
    are interested; and on those subjects, to read relatively short
    passages from a large number of authors. It helps us to read
    in the great books before we have read through them.
  - |-
    Syntopical reading in the great books, with the help of the Syntopicon, may also work suggestively. Starting from the reader's existing interest in a particular subject, it may arouse or create other interests in related subjects. And once started on an author, it is hard not to explore the context. Before you know it, you have read a good portion of the book.
    
    Finally, syntopical reading with the aid of the Syntopicon works instructively, in three distinct ways. This, in fact, is one of the major benefits of this level of reading.
    
    First, the topic in connection with which the passage is being read serves to give direction to the reader in interpreting the passage. But it does not tell him what the passage means, since the passage may be relevant to the topic in several or many different ways. Hence the reader is called upon to dis-
    
    332 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    cover precisely what relevance the passage has to the topic. To learn to do this is to acquire a major skill in the art of reading.
    
    Second, the collection of a number of passages on the same topic, but from different works and different authors, serves to sharpen the reader's interpretation of each passage read. Sometimes, when passages from the same book are read in sequence and in the context of one another, each becomes clearer. Sometimes the meaning of each of a series of contrasting or conflicting passages from different books is accentuated when they are read against one another. And sometimes the passages from one author, by amplifying or commenting on the passages from another, materially help the reader's understanding of the second author.
    
    Third, if syntopical reading is done on a number of different subjects, the fact that the same passage will often be found cited in the Syntopicon under two or more subjects will have its instructive effect. The passage has an amplitude of meaning that the reader will come to perceive as he interprets it somewhat differently in relation to different topics. Such multiple interpretation not only is a basic exercise in the art of reading but also tends to make the mind habitually alert to the many strains of meaning that any rich or complex passage can contain.
  - |-
    Because we believe that the Syntopicon can be useful to
    any reader wishing to read in the manner described in this
    chapter, be he a beginner or a mature scholar and researcher,
    we have taken the liberty of adopting its name for this level
    of reading. We hope the reader will forgive us what may seem
    to be a small self-indulgence. In return for that forgiveness,
    we would like to point out an important fact. There is a con-
    siderable difference between syntopical reading, with a small
    "s," and Syntopical reading, where the latter phrase refers to
    reading the great books with the help of the Syntopicon. Syn-
    topical reading, in the latter sense, can constitute a part of any
    syntopical reading project where the term is used in the
    
    The Fourth Level of Reading: Syntopical Reading 333
    
    former sense, and perhaps it would always be wise to start
    there. But syntopical reading with a small "s" is a term of much
    wider application than Syntopical reading.
    
    On the Principles That Underlie
    Syntopical Reading
  - |-
    There are those who say that syntopical reading (in the broader sense just mentioned) is impossible. It is wrong, they say, to impose a terminology, even a "neutral" one (if there is any such thing), on an author. His own terminology must be treated as sacrosanct, because books should never be read "out of context," and besides, translation from one set of terms to another is always dangerous because words are not controllable like mathematical symbols. Further, the objectors maintain, syntopical reading involves reading authors widely separated in space and time, and differing radically in style and approach, as if they were members of the same universe of discourse, as if they were talking to one another—and this distorts the facts of the matter. Each author is a little universe in himself, and although connections can be made between different books written by the same author at different times (even here there are dangers, they warn), there are no clear connections relating one author to another. They maintain, finally, that the subjects that authors discuss, as such, are not as important as the ways in which they discuss them. The style, they say, is the man; and if we ignore how an author says something, in the process of trying to discover what he says, we will miss both kinds of understanding.
    
    It should be apparent that we disagree with all of those charges, and therefore an answer to each of them is in order. Let us take them one at a time.
    
    First, to the point about terminology. To deny that an idea can be expressed in more than one set of terms is similar to denying that translation is possible from one natural language to another. That denial is made, of course. Recently, for example, we read an introduction to a new translation of the Koran that began by saying that to translate the Koran is impossible. But since the author then proceeded to explain how he had done it, we could only assume that he meant that translation is particularly difficult in the case of a book held to be holy by large numbers of people. We would agree. But the difficult is not the impossible.
  - |-
    In fact, the view that an author's terms must be treated  
    as sacrosanct is probably always merely another way of saying  
    that it is difficult to translate from one terminology to another.  
    We would agree to that, too. But again, the difficult is not  
    the impossible.
    
    Second, to the point about the separateness and unique-  
    ness of authors. This comes down to saying that if Aristotle,  
    for example, walked into our office, attired no doubt in robes  
    and accompanied by an interpreter who knew both modern  
    English and classical Greek, we would not be able to under-  
    stand him or he us. We simply do not believe it. Doubtless  
    Aristotle would be amazed at some of the things he saw, but  
    we are quite confident that within ten minutes we could, if  
    we wanted to, be engaged in a philosophical discussion of  
    problems that we shared. There might be recurrent difficulties  
    about certain conceptions, but as soon as we recognized them  
    as such, we could resolve them.
    
    If that is possible (and we do not really think anyone  
    would deny it), then it is not impossible for one book to "talk"  
    to another through the medium of an interpreter—namely, you,  
    the syntopical reader. Care is required, of course, and you  
    should know both "languages"—that is, both books—as well as  
    you can. But the problem is not insuperable, and it is simply  
    foolish to suggest that it is.
    
    Finally, to the point about the manner or style. This is  
    equivalent, we think, to saying that there is no rational com-  
    munication among men, but that all men communicate at the  
    emotional level, which is the same level at which they com-  
    municate with pets. If you say "I love you" to your dog in an

    angry tone of voice, he will cower; but he does not understand
    you. Can anyone seriously assert that there is nothing more
    than tone of voice or gesture in vocal communications between
    two human beings? Tone of voice is important, particularly
    when emotional relations are the primary content of the com-
    munication; and body language probably has things to tell us if we will only listen (look? ). But there is something else, too,
    in human communication. If you ask someone how to reach
    the exit, and he tells you to follow Corridor B, it does not
    matter what tone of voice he employs. He is either right or
    wrong, lying or telling the truth, but the point is that you will
    soon find that out by following Corridor B. You have under-
    stood what he said as well as reacting, no doubt in all sorts of
    ways, to how he said it.
    
    Believing, then, that translation is possible (because it is
    done all the time), that books can "talk" to one another (be-
    cause human beings do so), and that there is an objective,
    rational content of communication between human beings
    when they are trying to be rational (because we can and do
    learn from each other), we believe that syntopical reading is
    possible.
    
    Summary of Syntopical Reading
    
    We have now completed our discussion of syntopical read-
    ing. Let us therefore display the various steps that must be
    taken at this level of reading in outline form.
    
    As we have seen, there are two main stages of syntopical
    reading. One is preparatory, and the other is syntopical read-
    ing proper. Let us write out all of these steps for review.
    
    I. Surveying the Field
    Preparatory to Syntopical Reading
    
    1. Create a tentative bibliography of your subject by recourse
    to library catalogues, advisors, and bibliographies in books.
  - |-
    I. Syntopical Reading of the Bibliography Amassed in Stage I
    
    1. Inspect the books already identified as relevant to your subject in Stage I in order to find the most relevant passages.
    
    2. Bring the authors to terms by constructing a neutral terminology of the subject that all, or the great majority, of the authors can be interpreted as employing, whether they actually employ the words or not.
    
    3. Establish a set of neutral propositions for all of the authors by framing a set of questions to which all or most of the authors can be interpreted as giving answers, whether they actually treat the questions explicitly or not.
    
    4. Define the issues, both major and minor ones, by ranging the opposing answers of authors to the various questions on one side of an issue or another. You should remember that an issue does not always exist explicitly between or among authors, but that it sometimes has to be constructed by interpretation of the authors' views on matters that may not have been their primary concern.
    
    5. Analyze the discussion by ordering the questions and issues in such a way as to throw maximum light on the subject. More general issues should precede less general ones, and relations among issues should be clearly indicated.
    
    Note: Dialectical detachment or objectivity should, ideally, be maintained throughout. One way to ensure this is always to accompany an interpretation of an author's views on an issue with an actual quotation from his text.

    READING AND
    THE GROWTH OF THE MIND
    
    We have now completed the task that lay before us at the beginning of this book. We have shown that activity is the essence of good reading, and that the more active reading is, the better it is.
    
    We have defined active reading as the asking of questions, and we have indicated what questions must be asked of any book, and how those questions must be answered in different ways for different kinds of books.
  - |-
    We have identified and discussed the four levels of reading, and shown how these are cumulative, earlier or lower levels being contained in later or higher ones. Consequent upon our stated intention, we have laid more stress upon the later and higher levels of reading than upon the earlier and lower ones, and we have therefore emphasized analytical and syntopical reading. Since analytical reading is probably the most unfamiliar kind for most readers, we have discussed it at greater length than any of the other levels, giving its rules and explaining them in the order in which they must be applied. But almost everything that was said of analytical reading also applies, with certain adaptations that were mentioned in the last chapter, to syntopical reading as well.
    
    We have completed our task, but you may not have completed yours. We do not need to remind you that this is a
    
    337
    
    338 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    practical book, nor that the reader of a practical book has a
    special obligation with respect to it. If, we said, the reader of
    a practical book accepts the ends it proposes and agrees that
    the means recommended are appropriate and effective, then
    he must act in the way proposed. You may not accept the
    primary aim we have endorsed—namely, that you should be
    able to read as well as possible—nor the means we have pro-
    posed to reach it—namely, the rules of inspectional, analytical,
    and syntopical reading. (In that case, however, you are not
    likely to be reading this page.) But if you do accept that aim
    and agree that the means are appropriate, then you must make
    the effort to read as you probably have never read before.
    
    That is your task and your obligation. Can we help you
    in it in any way?
    
    We think we can. The task falls mainly on you—it is you
    who, henceforth, must do all the work (and obtain all the
    benefits ). But there are several things that remain to be said,
    about the end and the means. Let us discuss the latter first.
    
    What Good Books Can Do for Us
  - |-
    "Means" can be interpreted in two ways. In the previous paragraph, we interpreted the term as referring to the rules of reading, that is, the method by which you become a better reader. But "means" can also be interpreted as referring to the things you read. Having a method without materials to which it can be applied is as useless as having the materials with no method to apply to them.
    
    In the latter sense of the term, the means that will serve you in the further improvement of your reading are the books you will read. We have said that the method applies to anything you read, and that is true, if you understand by the statement any kind of book—whether fiction or nonfiction, imaginative or expository, practical or theoretical. But in fact, the method, at least as it is exemplified in our discussion of analytical and syntopical reading, does not apply to every book.
    
    The reason is that some books do not require it.
    
    We have made this point before, but we want to make it now again because of its relevance to the task that lies before you. If you are reading in order to become a better reader, you cannot read just any book or article. You will not improve as a reader if all you read are books that are well within your capacity. You must tackle books that are beyond you, or, as we have said, books that are over your head. Only books of that sort will make you stretch your mind. And unless you stretch, you will not learn.
  - |-
    Thus, it becomes of crucial importance for you not only to be able to read well but also to be able to identify those books that make the kinds of demands on you that improvement in reading ability requires. A book that can do no more than amuse or entertain you may be a pleasant diversion for an idle hour, but you must not expect to get anything but amusement from it. We are not against amusement in its own right, but we do want to stress that improvement in reading skill does not accompany it. The same goes for a book that merely informs you of facts that you did not know without adding to your understanding of those facts. Reading for information does not stretch your mind any more than reading for amusement. It may seem as though it does, but that is merely because your mind is fuller of facts than it was before you read the book. However, your mind is essentially in the same condition that it was before. There has been a quantitative change, but no improvement in your skill.
    
    We have said many times that the good reader makes demands on himself when he reads. He reads actively, effortfully. Now we are saying something else. The books that you will want to practice your reading on, particularly your analytical reading, must also make demands on you. They must seem to you to be beyond your capacity. You need not fear that they really are, because there is no book that is completely out of your grasp if you apply the rules of reading to it that we have described. This does not mean, of course, that these rules will accomplish immediate miracles for you. There are certainly some books that will continue to extend you no matter how good a reader you are. Actually, those are the very books that you must seek out, because they are the ones that can best help you to become an ever more skillful reader.
  - |-
    Some readers make the mistake of supposing that such books—the ones that provide a constant and never-ending challenge to their skill—are always ones in relatively unfamiliar fields. In practice, this comes down to believing, in the case of most readers, that only scientific books, and perhaps philosophical ones, satisfy the criterion. But that is far from the case. We have already remarked that the great scientific books are in many ways easier to read than non-scientific ones, because of the care with which scientific authors help you to come to terms, identify the key propositions, and state the main arguments. These helps are absent from poetic works, and so in the long run they are quite likely to be the hardest, the most demanding, books that you can read. Homer, for example, is in many ways harder to read than Newton, despite the fact that you may get more out of Homer the first time through. The reason is that Homer deals with subjects that are harder to write well about.
    
    The difficulties that we are talking about here are very different from the difficulties that are presented by a bad book. It is hard to read a bad book, too, for it defies your efforts to analyze it, slipping through your fingers whenever you think you have it pinned down. In fact, in the case of a bad book, there is really nothing to pin down. It is not worth the effort of trying. You receive no reward for your struggle.
    
    A good book does reward you for trying to read it. The best books reward you most of all. The reward, of course, is of two kinds. First, there is the improvement in your reading skill that occurs when you successfully tackle a good, difficult work. Second—and this in the long run is much more important—a good book can teach you about the world and about your-
    self. You learn more than how to read better; you also learn more about life. You become wiser. Not just more knowledgeable—books that provide nothing but information can produce that result. But wiser, in the sense that you are more deeply aware of the great and enduring truths of human life.
  - |-
    There are some human problems, after all, that have no  
    solution. There are some relationships, both among human be-  
    ings and between human beings and the nonhuman world,  
    about which no one can have the last word. This is true not  
    only in such fields as science and philosophy, where it is obvi-  
    ous that final understanding about nature and its laws, and  
    about being and becoming, has not been achieved by anyone  
    and never will be; it is also true of such familiar and everyday  
    matters as the relation between men and women, or parents  
    and children, or man and God. These are matters about which  
    you cannot think too much, or too well. The greatest books can  
    help you to think better about them, because they were  
    written by men and women who thought better than other  
    people about them.
    
    The Pyramid of Books
    
    The great majority of the several million books that have  
    been written in the Western tradition alone—more than 99  
    per cent of them—will not make sufficient demands on you for  
    you to improve your skill in reading. This may seem like a  
    distressing fact, and the percentages may seem an overestimate.  
    But obviously, considering the numbers involved, it is true.  
    These are the books that can be read only for amusement or in-  
    formation. The amusement may be of many kinds, and the infor-  
    mation may be interesting in all sorts of ways. But you should  
    not expect to learn anything of importance from them. In fact,  
    you do not have to read them—analytically—at all. Skimming  
    will do.
    
    There is a second class of books from which you can learn
  - |-
    —both how to read and how to live. Less than one out of every hundred books belongs in this class—probably it is more like one in a thousand, or even one in ten thousand. These are the good books, the ones that were carefully wrought by their authors, the ones that convey to the reader significant insights about subjects of enduring interest to human beings. There are in all probably no more than a few thousand such books. They make severe demands on the reader. They are worth reading analytically—once. If you are skillful, you will be able to get everything out of them that they can give in the course of one good reading. They are books that you read once and then put away on your shelf. You know that you will never have to read them again, although you may return to them to check certain points or to refresh your memory of certain ideas or episodes. (It is in the case of such books that the notes you make in the margin or elsewhere in the volume are particularly valuable.)
    
    How do you know that you do not ever have to read such books again? You know it by your own mental reaction to the experience of reading them. Such a book stretches your mind and increases your understanding. But as your mind stretches and your understanding increases, you realize, by a process that is more or less mysterious, that you are not going to be changed any more in the future by this book. You realize that you have grasped the book in its entirety. You have milked it dry. You are grateful to it for what it has given you, but you know it has no more to give.
  - |-
    Of the few thousand such books there is a much smaller  
    number—here the number is probably less than a hundred—  
    that cannot be exhausted by even the very best reading you  
    can manage. How do you recognize this? Again it is rather  
    mysterious, but when you have closed the book after reading  
    it analytically to the best of your ability, and place it back on  
    the shelf, you have a sneaking suspicion that there is more  
    there than you got. We say "suspicion" because that may be  
    all it is at this stage. If you knew what it was that you had  
    missed, your obligation as an analytical reader would take you  
    back to the book immediately to seek it out. In fact, you cannot  
    put your finger on it, but you know it is there. You find that  
    you cannot forget the book, that you keep thinking about it  
    and your reaction to it. Finally, you return to it. And then a  
    very remarkable thing happens.
    
    If the book belongs to the second class of books to which  
    we referred before, you find, on returning to it, that there was  
    less there than you remembered. The reason, of course, is that  
    you yourself have grown in the meantime. Your mind is fuller,  
    your understanding greater. The book has not changed, but  
    you have. Such a return is inevitably disappointing.
    
    But if the book belongs to the highest class—the very small  
    number of inexhaustible books—you discover on returning that  
    the book seems to have grown with you. You see new things in  
    it—whole sets of new things—that you did not see before. Your  
    previous understanding of the book is not invalidated (assum-  
    ing that you read it well the first time); it is just as true as it  
    ever was, and in the same ways that it was true before. But  
    now it is true in still other ways, too.

    How can a book grow as you grow? It is impossible, of course; a book, once it is written and published, does not change. But what you only now begin to realize is that the book was so far above you to begin with that it has remained above you, and probably always will remain so. Since it is a really good book—a great book, as we might say—it is accessible at different levels. Your impression of increased understanding on your previous reading was not false. The book truly lifted you then. But now, even though you have become wiser and more knowledgeable, it can lift you again. And it will go on doing this until you die.
    
    There are obviously not many books that can do this for any of us. Our estimate was that the number is considerably less than a hundred. But the number is even less than that for any given reader. Human beings differ in many ways other than in the power of their minds. They have different tastes;
    
    344 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    different things appeal more to one person than to another.
    You may never feel about Newton the way you feel about
    Shakespeare, either because you may be able to read Newton
    so well that you do not have to read him again, or because
    mathematical systems of the world just do not have all that
    appeal to you. Or, if they do—Charles Darwin is an example
    of such a person—then Newton may be one of the handful of
    books that are great for you, and not Shakespeare.
    
    We do not want to state authoritatively that any particular
    book or group of books must be great for you, in this sense,
    although in our first Appendix we do list those books that ex-
    perience has shown are capable of having this kind of value for
    many readers. Our point, instead, is that you should seek out
    the few books that can have this value for you. They are the
    books that will teach you the most, both about reading and
    about life. They are the books to which you will want to re-
    turn over and over. They are the books that will help you to
    
    grow.
    
    The Life and Growth of the Mind
  - |-
    There is an old test—it was quite popular a generation ago—that was designed to tell you which books are the ones that can do this for you. Suppose, the test went, that you know in advance that you will be marooned on a desert island for the rest of your life, or at least for a long period. Suppose, too, that you have time to prepare for the experience. There are certain practical and useful articles that you would be sure to take with you. You will also be allowed ten books. Which ones would you select?
    
    Trying to decide on a list is instructive, and not only because it may help you to identify the books that you would most like to read and reread. That, in fact, is probably of minor importance, compared with what you can learn about yourself when you imagine what life would be like if you were cut off from all the sources of amusement, information, and understanding that ordinarily surround you. Remember, there would be no radio or television on the island, and no lending library. There would be just you and ten books.
    
    This imagined situation seems bizarre and unreal when you begin to think about it. But is it actually so unreal? We do not think so. We are all to some extent persons marooned on a desert island. We all face the same challenge that we would face if we really were there—the challenge of finding the resources within ourselves to live a good human life.
    
    There is a strange fact about the human mind, a fact that differentiates the mind sharply from the body. The body is limited in ways that the mind is not. One sign of this is that the body does not continue indefinitely to grow in strength and develop in skill and grace. By the time most people are thirty years old, their bodies are as good as they will ever be; in fact, many persons' bodies have begun to deteriorate by that time. But there is no limit to the amount of growth and development that the mind can sustain. The mind does not stop growing at any particular age; only when the brain itself loses its vigor, in senescence, does the mind lose its power to increase in skill and understanding.
  - |-
    This is one of the most remarkable things about human beings, and it may actually be the major difference between homo sapiens and the others animals, which do not seem to grow mentally beyond a certain stage in their development. But this great advantage that man possesses carries with it a great peril. The mind can atrophy, like the muscles, if it is not used. Atrophy of the mental muscles is the penalty that we pay for not taking mental exercise. And this is a terrible penalty, for there is evidence that atrophy of the mind is a mortal disease. There seems to be no other explanation for the fact that so many busy people die so soon after retirement. They were kept alive by the demands of their work upon their minds; they were propped up artificially, as it were, by external forces. But as soon as those demands cease, having no resources within themselves in the way of mental activity, they cease thinking altogether, and expire.
    
    Television, radio, and all the sources of amusement and information that surround us in our daily lives are also artificial props. They can give us the impression that our minds are active, because we are required to react to stimuli from outside. But the power of those external stimuli to keep us going is limited. They are like drugs. We grow used to them, and we continuously need more and more of them. Eventually, they have little or no effect. Then, if we lack resources within ourselves, we cease to grow intellectually, morally, and spiritually. And when we cease to grow, we begin to die.
    
    Reading well, which means reading actively, is thus not only a good in itself, nor is it merely a means to advancement in our work or career. It also serves to keep our minds alive and growing.
    
    APPENDIX A
    A RECOMMENDED READING LIST
  - |-
    On the following pages appears a list of books that it would be worth your while to read. We mean the phrase "worth your while" quite seriously. Although not all of the books listed are "great" in any of the commonly accepted meanings of the term, all of them will reward you for the effort you make to read them. All of these books are over most people's heads—sufficiently so, at any rate, to force most readers to stretch their minds to understand and appreciate them. And that, of course, is the kind of book you should seek out if you want to improve your reading skills, and at the same time discover the best that has been thought and said in our literary tradition.
    
    Some of the books are great in the special sense of the term that we employed in the last chapter. On returning to them, you will always find something new, often many things. They are endlessly re-readable. Another way to say this is that some of the books—we will not say exactly how many, nor will we try to identify them, since to some extent this is an individual judgment—are over the heads of all readers, no matter how skillful. As we observed in the last chapter, these are the works that everyone should make a special effort to seek out. They are the truly great books; they are the books that anyone should choose to take with him to his own desert island.

    348 HOW TO READ A BOOK
  - |-
    The list is long, and it may seem a little overwhelming.  
    We urge you not to allow yourself to be abashed by it. In the  
    first place, you are likely to recognize the names of most of the  
    authors. There is nothing here that is so recondite as to be  
    esoteric. More important, we want to remind you that it is wise  
    to begin with those books that interest you most, for whatever  
    reason. As we have pointed out several times, the primary aim  
    is to read well, not widely. You should not be disappointed if  
    you read no more than a handful of the books in a year. The  
    list is not something to be gotten through in any amount of  
    time. It is not a challenge that you can meet only by finishing  
    every item on it. Instead, it is an invitation that you can ac-  
    cept graciously by beginning wherever you feel at home.  
    
    The authors are listed chronologically, according to the  
    known or supposed date of their birth. When several works of  
    an author are listed, these too are arranged chronologically, where that is possible. Scholars do not always agree about the  
    first publication of a book, but this need not concern you. The  
    point to remember is that the list as a whole moves forward  
    through time. That does not necessarily mean that you should  
    read it chronologically, of course. You might even start with  
    the end of the list and read backward to Homer and the Old  
    Testament.  
    
    We have not listed all the works of every author. We  
    have usually cited only the more important titles, selecting  
    them, in the case of expository books, to show the diversity of  
    an author's contribution to different fields of learning. In some  
    instances, we have listed an author's Works and specified, in  
    brackets, those titles that are especially important or useful.
  - |-
    In drawing up a list of this kind, the greatest difficulty
    always arises with respect to the relatively contemporary
    items. The closer an author is to our own time, the harder it
    is to exercise a detached judgment about him. It is all very
    well to say that time will tell, but we may not want to wait.
    Thus, with regard to the more recent writers and books, there
    is much room for differences of opinion, and we would not
    claim for the later items on our list the degree of authority
    that we can claim for the earlier ones.
    Appendix A 349
    
    There may be differences of opinion about some of the
    earlier items too, and we may be charged with being preju-
    diced against some authors that we have not listed at all. We
    are willing to admit that this may be true, in some cases. This
    is our list, and it may differ in some respects from lists drawn
    up by others. But it will not differ very significantly if every-
    one concurs seriously in the aim of making up a reading pro-
    gram that is worth spending a lifetime on. Ultimately, of
    course, you should make up your own list, and then go to work
    on it. It is wise, however, to read a fair number of the books
    that have been unanimously acclaimed before you branch off
    on your own. This list is a place to begin.
  - |-
    We want to mention one omission that may strike some readers as unfortunate, The list contains only Western authors and books; there are no Chinese, Japanese, or Indian works. There are several reasons for this. One is that we are not particularly knowledgeable outside of the Western literary tradition, and our recommendations would carry little weight. Another is that there is in the East no single tradition, as there is in the West, and we would have to be learned in all Eastern traditions in order to do the job well. There are very few scholars who have this kind of acquaintance with all the works of the East. Third, there is something to be said for knowing your own tradition before trying to understand that of other parts of the world. Many persons who today attempt to read such books as the I Ching or the Bhagavad-Gita are baffled, not only because of the inherent difficulty of such works, but also because they have not learned to read well by practicing on the more accessible works—more accessible to them—of their own culture. And finally, the list is long enough as it is.
    
    One other omission requires comment. The list, being one of books, includes the names of few persons known primarily as lyric poets. Some of the writers on the list wrote lyric poems, of course, but they are best known for other, longer works. This fact is not to be taken as reflecting a prejudice on our part against lyric poetry. But we would recommend starting with a good anthology of poetry rather than with the collected works of a single author. Palgrave's The Golden Treasury and The Oxford Book of English Verse are excellent places to start. These older anthologies should be supplemented by more modern ones—for example, Selden Rodman's One Hundred Modern Poems, a collection widely available in paperback that extends the notion of a lyric poem in interesting ways. Since reading lyric poetry requires special skill, we would also recommend any of several available handbooks on the subject—for example, Mark Van Doren's Introduction to Poetry, an anthology that also contains short discussions of how to read many famous lyrics.
  - |-
    We have listed the books by author and title, but we  
    have not attempted to indicate a publisher or a particular  
    edition. Almost every work on the list is available in some  
    form, and many are available in several editions, both paper-  
    back and hard cover. However, we have indicated which  
    authors and titles are included in two sets that we ourselves  
    have edited. Titles included in Great Books of the Western  
    World are identified by a single asterisk; authors represented  
    in Gateway to the Great Books are identified by a double  
    asterisk.

    EXERCISES AND TESTS
    AT THE FOUR LEVELS OF READING
    
    Introductory
  - |-
    This Appendix offers a highly abbreviated sample of what  
    Reading Exercises for independent study or group study are  
    like. Obviously the sample cannot provide a thorough or ex-  
    haustive set of exercises, such as one would expect to find in  
    a manual or workbook. However, it can perhaps go a certain  
    way toward suggesting what such exercises would be, and  
    how to get the most out of them.
    
    The Appendix contains brief exercises and test questions  
    at each of the four levels of reading:
    
    At the First Level of Reading—Elementary Reading—the  
    texts used are biographical notes about two of the authors  
    included in Great Books of the Western World, John Stuart  
    Mill and Sir Isaac Newton.
    
    At the Second Level of Reading—Inspectional Reading—  
    the texts used are the tables of contents of two works included  
    in Great Books of the Western World, Dante's Divine Comedy  
    and Darwin's The Origin of Species.
    
    At the Third Level of Reading—Analytical Reading—the  
    text used is How to Read a Book itself.
    
    At the Fourth Level of Reading—Syntopical Reading—  
    the texts used are selected passages reprinted from two other  
    
    363  
    
    364 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    works included in Great Books of the Western World, Aris-  
    totle's Politics and Rousseau's The Social Contract.
    
    The reader will probably find that the sample exercises at  
    the first two levels of reading are more familiar and conven-  
    tional than those at the last two levels. This Appendix, unlike  
    a more elaborate manual, can do little more than reinforce  
    and clarify the distinctions between the various levels of read-  
    ing and the differences between the various kinds of books. It  
    cannot attempt to provide a really comprehensive and inten-  
    sive exercise workbook.
    
    It has become commonplace to criticize reading exercises  
    and test questions on the grounds that they are not scientifi-  
    cally standardized, that they are culturally discriminatory, that  
    by themselves they are not reliably predictive of success in  
    schooling or in subsequent career progress, that questions  
    often permit of more than one appropriate or "correct" answer,  
    and that for all these reasons, grading by tests is to a certain  
    extent arbitrary.
  - |-
    Much of this and similar criticism of the tests is valid, particularly if major decisions about school standing or placement, or about employment opportunities, are based exclusively on results drawn from these tests. However, many of the tests do effectively distinguish or identify degrees of competence, and they will continue to be widely employed in making academic and career judgments about individuals. Even if there were no other reasons, this reason by itself makes it desirable that the reader have some familiarity with the mechanics of these exercises and test questions.
    
    It is particularly to be noted that the texts used in most such reading exercises are selected primarily for the sake of the test questions that are based on them. Hence the texts themselves are for the most part unrelated; frequently they are fragments—bits and pieces of technical pedantry or mere trivia.
    
    In this Appendix, merely exemplary though it be, the emphasis is quite otherwise. The texts used for practice and to provide material for testing are themselves worth reading. Indeed, they are indispensable reading for anyone who wishes to advance beyond the first levels of reading. The texts are selected and the questions based on them are designed as tools for learning how to read what is worth reading.
  - |-
    A word about the form of the questions used in the tests  
    that appear in the following pages. It is customary in such  
    tests to employ a number of different kinds of questions. There  
    are essay questions and multiple-choice questions. An essay  
    question, of course, requires the person being tested to respond  
    to something he has read in an extended statement. Multiple-  
    choice questions are in turn of many kinds; usually they are  
    presented in homogeneous groups. Sometimes a series of state-  
    ments follows the reading exercise, and the person being  
    tested is asked to indicate which statement best expresses the  
    main idea or ideas of the passage read. In other cases the  
    reader may be offered a choice of statements about a detail in  
    the text, only one of which is a valid interpretation of the text,  
    or at least is more apt than the others; or it may be the other  
    way around; one is an incorrect choice, and the others are  
    correct. Or a verbatim quotation may be given from the text  
    to discover whether the reader has taken note of it and re-  
    membered it. Sometimes, in a statement either quoted directly  
    or simply drawn from the text the reader will find a blank  
    indicating that one or more words that will make sense of the  
    statement have been omitted. Then follows a list of choices,  
    lettered or numbered, among which the person being tested is  
    asked to choose the phrase that, when inserted in the blank,  
    best completes the statement.
    
    Most questions may be answered directly from the pas-  
    sage read. But some questions require the reader to go outside  
    the text for material that it is assumed he knows, material re-  
    quired to answer the question correctly. Still other questions  
    are inferential: that is, they draw certain inferences from the  
    text. The person taking the test is asked to select from a group  
    of possibilities the inferences that can reasonably be drawn  
    from the text; or he may be expected to recognize and discard  
    inferences that are spurious and have no foundation in the  
    text.

    test to be used widely in critical academic and career situa-
    tions, then the choice of the kinds of questions and the fram-
    ing of the questions themselves become critical as well. For-
    tunately, we do not face that kind of task in this Appendix.
    Instead, we are merely suggesting some approaches that may
    be tried in a course of independent study aimed at improving
    one's own reading skills. We will employ in what follows most
    of the kinds of questions just described—not segregating the
    types in groups as is usually done—and some other kinds as
    well. Some are quite easy, others are very difficult; the difficult
    questions may be the most fun to try to answer.
    
    Because some of the questions are very difficult, and be-
    cause we have framed them with the intention as much of
    causing you to reflect on what you have read as to test you on
    what you have read, we have in many cases given more than
    the customary short and cryptic answers to the questions.
    This is particularly so in the case of the questions in the last
    part of this Appendix, the section dealing with syntopical
    reading. There, we have taken the liberty of leading the reader
    by the hand, as it were, framing the questions in such a way
    as to suggest an overall interpretation of the texts read, and
    answering the questions as much as possible as though we
    were present in person.

    of Reading: Elementary Reading
    
    Two short biographical sketches appear in this section of
    the Appendix. One outlines the life of John Stuart Mill, the
    other that of Sir Isaac Newton. The Mill sketch appears first,
    although of course Newton predates Mill by nearly two cen-
    turies.
    
    This biographical sketch of Mill is reprinted from Vol-
    ume 43 of Great Books of the Western World. Besides the
    Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation,
    the U.S. Constitution, and the Federalist Papers of Hamilton,

     volume contains three complete works by Mill: On Liberty,
    Representative Government and Utilitarianism. These are three
    of Mill's greatest works, but they by no means exhaust his
    writings. The Subjection of Women, for example, is of great
    contemporary interest, not only because Mill was one of the
    first thinkers in Western history to advocate complete equality
    for women, but also because of the book's trenchant style and
    the many insights it expresses about the relations of men and
    women at any time and place.
    
    At the first level of reading, speed is not of the essence.
    The sketch of Mill's life that follows is about 1,200 words
    long. We suggest that it be read at a comfortable speed—in
    perhaps six to ten minutes. We also suggest that you mark
    phrases and sentences in the text that especially interest you
    and perhaps also make a few notes. Then try to answer the
    questions we have appended.
    
    JouN STUART MILL
    1806-1873
    
    Mill, in his Autobiography, declared that his intellectual de-
    velopment was due primarily to the influence of two people: his
    father, James Mill, and his wife.
    
    James Mill elaborated for his son a comprehensive educational
    program, modelled upon the theories of Helvétius and Bentham. It
    was encyclopedic in scope and equipped Mill by the time he was
    thirteen with the equivalent of a thorough university education.
    The father acted as the boy's tutor and constant companion, allow-
    ing Mill to work in the same room with him and even to interrupt
    him as he was writing his History of India or his articles for the
    Encyclopaedia Britannica. Mill later described the result as one
    that "made me appear as a ‘made' or manufactured man, having
    had a certain impress of opinion stamped upon me which I could
    only reproduce."
    
    The education began with Greek and arithmetic at the age of
    three. By the time he was eight Mill had read through the whole
    of Herodotus, six dialogues of Plato and considerable history. Be-
    fore he was twelve he had studied Euclid and algebra, the Greek
    and Latin poets, and some English poetry. His interest in history

    He continued, and he even attempted writing an account of Roman government. At twelve he was introduced to logic in Aristotle's Organon and the Latin scholastic manuals on the subject. The last year under his father's direct supervision, his thirteenth, was devoted to political economy; the son's notes later served the elder Mill in his Elements of Political Economy. He furthered his education by a period of studies with his father's friends, reading law with Austin and economics with Ricardo, and completed it by himself with Bentham's treatise on legislation, which he felt gave him "a creed, a doctrine, a philosophy . . . a religion" and made a "different being of him."
    
    Although Mill never actually severed relations with his father, he experienced, at the age of twenty, a "crisis" in his mental history. It occurred to him to pose the question: "Suppose that all your objects in life were realized; that all the changes in institutions and opinions which you are looking forward to, could be completely effected at this very instant: would this be a great joy and happiness to you?" He reported that "an irrepressible self-consciousness distinctly answered, 'No,' and he was overcome by a depression which lasted for several years. The first break in his 'gloom' came while reading Marmontel's Mémoires: "I . . . came to the passage which relates his father's death, the distressed position of the family, and the sudden inspiration by which he, then a mere boy, felt and made them feel that he would be everything to them — would supply the place of all that they had lost." He was moved to tears by the scene, and from this moment his "burden grew lighter."

    From the time he was seventeen, Mill supported himself by working for the East India Company, where his father was an official. Although he began nominally as a clerk, he was soon promoted to assistant-examiner, and for twenty years, from his father's death in 1836, until the Company's activities were taken over by the British Government, he had charge of the relations with the Indian states, which gave him wide practical experience in the problems of government. In addition to his regular employment, he took part in many activities tending to prepare public opinion for legislative reform. He, his father, and their friends formed the group known as "philosophical radicals," which made a major contribution to the debates leading to the Reform Bill of 1832. Mill was active in exposing what he considered departures from sound principle in parliament and the courts of justice. He wrote often for the newspapers friendly to the "radical" cause, helped to found and edit the Westminster Review as a "radical" organ, and participated in several reading and debating societies, devoted to the discussion of the contemporary intellectual and social problems.
    
    These activities did not prevent him from pursuing his own intellectual interests. He edited Bentham's Rationale of Judicial Evidence. He studied logic and science with the aim of reconciling syllogistic logic with the methods of inductive science, and published his System of Logic (1843). At the same time he pushed his inquiries in the field of economics. These first took the form of Essays on Some Unsettled Questions in Political Economy and were later given systematic treatment in the Principles of Political Economy (1848).
  - |-
    The development and productivity of these years he attributed  
    to his relationship with Mrs. Harriet Taylor, who became his wife  
    in 1851. Mill had known her for twenty years, since shortly after  
    his "crisis," and he could never praise too highly her influence upon  
    his work. Although he published less during the seven years of his  
    married life than at any other period of his career, he thought out  
    and partly wrote many of his important works, including the essay  
    On Liberty (1859), the Thoughts on Parliamentary Reform, which  
    later led to the Representative Government (1861), and Utilitari-  
    anism (1863). He attributed to her especially his understanding  
    of the human side of the abstract reforms he advocated. After her  
    death he stated: "Her memory is to me a religion, and her approba-  
    tion the standard by which, summing up as it does all worthiness,  
    I endeavour to regulate my life."
    
    Mill devoted a large part of his last years directly to political  
    activity. In addition to his writings, he was one of the founders of  
    the first women's suffrage society and, in 1865, consented to be-  
    come a member of Parliament. Voting with the radical wing of  
    the Liberal Party, he took an active part in the debates on Dis-  
    raeli's Reform Bill and promoted the measures which he had long  
    advocated, such as the representation of women, the reform of  
    London government, and the alteration of land tenure in Ireland.  
    Largely because of his support of unpopular measures, he was de-  
    feated for re-election. He retired to his cottage in Avignon, which  
    had been built so that he might be close to the grave of his wife,  
    and died there May 8, 1873.

    Note that the questions in these tests are not all of the  
    same type: there are several kinds of multiple-choice questions  
    and some essay questions as well. Some questions call for in-  
    formation not included in the passage you have read—the  
    background information a capable reader brings to whatever  
    he reads. Select all the answers which seem to you to be valid,  
    whether they are stated or implied in the text, or simply seem  
    to you true on the basis of logic or your background informa-

    Turn to p. 413 for the answers to Test A.
    
    Sir Isaac Newton is of enormous interest to scholars and historians of science at the present day. There are two main reasons for this. The first is a commonplace. By combining analysis with experimentation—by combining theorizing with systematic observation of natural phenomena—men like Galileo and Newton launched an intellectual revolution and helped to usher in our modern age of science. Not only did they discover truths about the physical world that continue to be relevant and important, but they also developed new methods of studying nature that have proved to be of wide usefulness in many areas of study and research.
    
    That, as we said, is a commonplace; that aspect of Newton's life and achievement has been known and discussed for centuries. More recently, Newton has become the center of a worldwide study of the character of genius. Scholars and students of science and literature endlessly rank scientists and authors as more or less great, or on a scale ranging from extraordinary to genius. There is a considerable body of learned opinion that maintains that Newton was the supreme genius—the greatest intellect of all time. Many efforts have been made to characterize and account for genius. Precocity, the ability to concentrate, acute intuitiveness, rigorous analytical capacity—by terms such as these genius is described. All these terms seem to apply to Isaac Newton.
  - |-
    The biographical sketch of Newton that follows is re-
    printed from Volume 34 of Great Books of the Western World.
    That volume contains the texts of Newton's Mathematical
    Principles of Natural Philosophy (often known as Newton's
    Principia) and of his Optics; it also contains the text of the
    Treatise on Light of the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens.
    The biography of Newton is somewhat longer than the one of
    Mill; therefore, take ten to twelve minutes to read it. As before,
    mark the most striking passages and make notes. Then try to
    answer the questions that follow.

    1642-1727
    
    Newton was born at Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, on Christmas
    Day, 1642. His father, a small farmer, died a few months before
    his birth, and when in 1645 his mother married the rector of North
    Witham, Newton was left with his maternal grandmother at Wools-
    thorpe. After having acquired the rudiments of education at small
    schools close by, Newton was sent at the age of twelve to the
    grammar school at Grantham, where he lived in the house of an
    apothecary. By his own account, Newton was at first an indifferent
    scholar until a successful fight with another boy aroused a spirit of
    emulation and led to his becoming first in the school. He displayed
    very early a taste and aptitude for mechanical contrivances; he
    made windmills, water clocks, kites, and sundials, and he is said to
    have invented a four-wheel carriage which was to be moved by
    the rider.

    After the death of her second husband in 1656, Newton's mother returned to Woolsthorpe and removed her eldest son from school so that he might prepare himself to manage the farm. But it was soon evident that his interests were not in farming, and upon the advice of his uncle, the rector of Burton Coggles, he was sent to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1661 as one of the boys who performed menial services in return for their expenses. Although there is no record of his formal progress as a student, Newton is known to have read widely in mathematics and mechanics. His first reading at Cambridge was in the optical works of Kepler. He turned to Euclid because he was bothered by his inability to comprehend certain diagrams in a book on astrology he had bought at a fair; finding its propositions self-evident, he put it aside as "a trifling book," until his teacher, Isaac Barrow, induced him to take up the book again. It appears to have been the study of Descartes' Geometry which inspired him to do original mathematical work. In a small commonplace book kept by Newton as an undergraduate, there are several articles on angular sections and the squaring of curves, several calculations about musical notes, geometrical problems from Vieta and Van Schooten, annotations out of Wallis' Arithmetic of Infinities, together with observations on refraction, on the grinding of spherical optic glasses, on the errors of lenses, and on the extraction of all kinds of roots. It was around the time of his taking the Bachelor's degree, in 1665, that Newton discovered the binomial theorem and made the first notes on his discovery of the "method of fluxions."
  - |-
    When the Great Plague spread from London to Cambridge in 1665, college was dismissed, and Newton retired to the farm in Lincolnshire, where he conducted experiments in optics and chemistry and continued his mathematical speculations. From this forced retirement in 1666 he dated his discovery of the gravitational theory: "In the same year I began to think of gravity extending to the orb of the Moon, . . . compared the force requisite to keep the Moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth and found them to answer pretty nearly." At about the same time his work on optics led to his explanation of the composition of white light. Of the work he accomplished in these years Newton later remarked: "All this was in the two years of 1665 and 1666, for in those years I was in the prime of my age for invention and minded Mathematics and Philosophy more than at any time since."
    
    374 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    On the reopening of Trinity College in 1667, Newton was elected a fellow, and two years later, a little before his twenty-seventh birthday, he was appointed Lucasian professor of mathematics, succeeding his friend and teacher, Dr. Barrow. Newton had already built a reflecting telescope in 1668; the second telescope of his making he presented to the Royal Society in December, 1671. Two months later, as a fellow of the Society, he communicated his discovery on light and thereby started a controversy which was to run for many years and to involve Hooke, Lucas, Linus, and others. Newton, who always found controversy distasteful, "blamed my own imprudence for parting with so substantial a blessing as my quiet to run after a shadow." His papers on optics, the most important of which were communicated to the Royal Society between 1672 and 1676, were collected in the Optics (1704).
  - |-
    It was not until 1684 that Newton began to think of making
    known his work on gravity. Hooke, Halley, and Sir Christopher
    Wren had independently come to some notion of the law of
    gravity but were not having any success in explaining the orbits of
    the planets. In that year Halley consulted Newton on the problem
    and was astonished to find that he had already solved it. Newton
    submitted to him four theorems and seven problems, which proved
    to be the nucleus of his major work. In some seventeen or eighteen
    months during 1685 and 1686 he wrote in Latin the Mathematical
    Principles of Natural Philosophy. Newton thought for some time of
    suppressing the third book, and it was only Halley's insistence that
    preserved it. Halley also took upon himself the cost of publishing
    the work in 1687 after the Royal Society proved unable to meet its
    cost. The book caused great excitement throughout Europe, and
    in 1689 Huygens, at that time the more famous scientist, came to
    England to make the personal acquaintance of Newton.
    
    While working upon the Principles, Newton had begun to
    take a more prominent part in university affairs. For his opposition
    to the attempt of James II to repudiate the oath of allegiance and
    supremacy at the university, Newton was elected parliamentary
    member for Cambridge. On his return to the university, he suf-
    fered a serious illness which incapacitated him for most of 1692
    and 1693 and caused considerable concern to his friends and
    fellow workers. After his recovery, he left the university to work
    for the government. Through his friends Locke, Wren, and Lord
    Halifax, Newton was made Warden of the Mint in 1695 and four
    years later, Master of the Mint, a position he held until his death.
  - |-
    For the last thirty years of his life Newton produced little  
    original mathematical work. He kept his interest and his skill in  
    the subject; in 1696 he solved overnight a problem offered by  
    Bernoulli in a competition for which six months had been allowed,  
    and again in 1716 he worked in a few hours a problem which  
    Leibniz had proposed in order to "feel the pulse of the English  
    analysts." He was much occupied, to his own distress, with two  
    mathematical controversies, one regarding the astronomical obser-  
    vations of the astronomer royal, and the other with Leibniz re-  
    garding the invention of calculus. He also worked on revisions for  
    a second edition of the Principles, which appeared in 1713.
    
    Newton's scientific work brought him great fame. He was a  
    popular visitor at the Court and was knighted in 1705. Many  
    honors came to him from the continent; he was in correspondence  
    with all the leading men of science, and visitors became so frequent  
    as to prove a serious discomfort. Despite his fame, Newton main-  
    tained his modesty. Shortly before his death, he remarked: "I do  
    not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to  
    have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting  
    myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier  
    shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undis-  
    covered before me."
    
    From an early period of his life Newton had been much in-  
    terested in theological studies and before 1690 had begun to study  
    the prophecies. In that year he wrote, in the form of a letter to  
    Locke, an Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of the  
    Scriptures, regarding two passages on the Trinity. He left in manu-  
    script Observations on the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse  
    and other works of exegesis.

    After 1725, Newton's health was much impaired, and his duties at the Mint were discharged by a deputy. In February, 1727, he presided for the last time at the Royal Society, of which he had been president since 1703, and died on March 20, 1727, in his eighty-fifth year. He was buried in Westminster Abbey after lying in state in the Jerusalem Chamber.

    Turn to p. 413 for the answers to Test B.
    
    You have now completed the two-part reading exercise at the first level of reading. You will of course have noted that, as we reminded you they would, the questions draw not only on the texts read but also on historical and other information not explicitly included in the text. The capable reader, even at this first level, can bring useful information to bear on whatever he reads. In general, the better informed he is, the better he reads.
    
    If you have done reasonably well in answering the test questions, it must be obvious to you that you are a pretty well-rounded reader and that you have reached and even exceeded the standards set for Elementary Reading. We hope you have also recognized that these exercises and tests were designed not only to improve your skill as a reader but also to help you learn something worth knowing, or to apply something you already know to what you read.
    
    II. Exercises and Tests at the Second Level
    of Reading: Inspectional Reading
    
    The tables of contents of two works included in Great
    Books of the Western World are used as texts for reading and
  - |-
    Appendix B 379  
    
    Testing in this section of Appendix B. In addition, short biographical sketches of their authors—Dante and Darwin—are also reprinted here, for the reader's information and also as material from which test questions are drawn.
    
    The biography of Dante and the table of contents of his *Divine Comedy* are taken from Volume 21 of *Great Books of the Western World*. That volume contains only the *Divine Comedy*. But Dante wrote other works, in prose and verse, of great interest and beauty, although only his *Comedy* (the adjective "Divine" was added after his death) is widely read today.
    
    You will recall, from Chapter 4, that there are two steps in Inspectional Reading. The first we called Pre-Reading or Skimming; the second, Superficial Reading. As we do not have the entire text of the *Divine Comedy* before us for this sample reading exercise, we will treat the table of contents of the work, given here in its entirety, as though it were a book in itself. That is, we suggest that you spend less than ten minutes (here, speed is of the essence) systematically skimming the whole table of contents, after which you can try answering some questions; and then we will ask you to read the table of contents over again superficially—that is, in about twenty minutes—and then answer some more questions.
    
    The total reading time to be devoted to the table of contents of the *Divine Comedy* is therefore half an hour. Considering that scholars have devoted thirty years of their lives to the *Divine Comedy*, we dare say that thirty minutes of inspection is indeed superficial. At the same time, it is not presumptuous or vain. One can learn a lot about this great poem in half an hour. And as to those for whom Dante and the *Divine Comedy* are vague names at best, a careful inspection of the table of contents may induce them to inspect the whole work, or even lead them on to read the whole analytically, at the third level of reading.
    
    Before giving the table of contents your first inspection—before either pre-reading or systematically skimming it—read the biographical note about Dante in a few minutes. It will

    questions.
    
    DANTE ALIGHIERI
    1265-1321
    
    Dante Alighieri was born in Florence about the middle of
    May, 1265. The city, then under its first democratic constitution,
    was sharply divided between the Papal party of the Guelphs and
    the Imperial party of the Ghibellines. Dante's family were ad-
    herents of the Guelph faction, and when Dante was only a few
    months old, the Guelphs obtained decisive victory at the Battle of
    Benevento. Although of noble ancestry, the Alighieri family was
    neither wealthy nor particularly prominent.
    
    It seems probable that Dante received his early education at
    the Franciscan school of Santa Croce. He evidently owed much to
    the influence of Brunetto Latini, the philosopher and scholar who
    figured largely in the councils of the Florentine commune. Before
    Dante was twenty, he began writing poetry and became associated
    with the Italian poets of the "sweet new style," who exalted their
    love and their ladies in philosophical verse. Dante's "lady," whom
    he celebrated with singular devotion, was a certain Beatrice. Ac-
    cording to Boccaccio's life of Dante, she was Beatrice Portinari,
    daughter of a Florentine citizen, who married a wealthy banker
    and died when she was but twenty-four. Dante first sang of
    Beatrice in the Vita Nuova (1292), a sequence of poems with
    prose comment in which he recounts the story of his love, of the
    first meeting when they were both nine years of age, of the ex-
    change of greetings which passed between them on May Day,
    1283, and of Beatrice's death in 1290.
  - |-
    Upon turning thirty, Dante became actively involved in Florentine politics. The constitution of the city was based upon the guilds, and Dante, upon his enrolment in the guild of physicians and apothecaries, which also included book dealers, became eligible for office. He participated in the deliberations of the councils, served on a special embassy, and in 1300 was elected one of the six priors that governed the city. The former struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines had appeared in new form in the conflict between the Whites and the Blacks. As one of the priors, Dante seems to have been influential in the move to lessen factionalism by banishing from Florence the rival leaders, including among the Blacks his wife's relative, Corso Donati, and among the Whites his "first friend," the poet, Guido Cavalcanti. Despite the opposition of Dante and the White leaders to Papal interference in Florentine affairs, Pope Boniface VIII in 1301 invited Charles of Valois, brother of King Philip of France, to enter Florence to settle the differences between the two factions. Actually he assisted the Blacks to seize power, and more than six hundred Whites were condemned to exile. In 1302 Dante, with four others of the White party, was charged with corruption in office. He was condemned to pay a fine of five thousand florins within three days or lose his property, exiled for two years, and denied the right ever again to hold public office. Three months later, upon his refusal to pay the fine, Dante was condemned to be burned alive if he should come within the power of the republic.
  - |-
    "After it was the pleasure of the citizens of the most beautiful  
    and most famous daughter of Rome, Florence, to chase me forth  
    from her sweet bosom," Dante writes of his exile in the Convivio,  
    "I have gone through almost every region to which this tongue of  
    ours extends, showing against my will the wound of fortune." It is  
    recorded that Dante attended a meeting at San Godenzo, where an  
    alliance was formed between the Whites in exile and the Ghibel-  
    lines, but he does not seem to have been present in 1304 when the  
    combined forces were defeated at Lastra. Perhaps he had already  
    separated himself from the "evil and foolish company" of his  
    fellow-exiles, "formed a party by himself," and found his "first  
    refuge and hostelry" at the court of the Della Scalas in Verona.  
    Probably during the following years he spent time at Bologna and  
    later at Padua, where Giotto is said to have entertained him.  
    Toward the end of 1306 he was the guest of the Malaspinas in  
    Lunigiana and acted as their ambassador in making peace with the  
    Bishop of Luni. Some time after this date he may have visited Paris  
    and attended the university there.
    
    During the early years of his exile Dante appears to have  
    studied in those subjects which gained him the title of philosopher  
    and theologian as well as poet. In the Convivio, probably written  
    between 1305 and 1308, he tells how, after the death of Beatrice,  
    he turned to Cicero's De Amicitia and the Consolatio Philosophiae  
    of Boethius, which awoke in him the love of philosophy. To sing  
    its praises he began his Convivio, which he intended to be a kind  
    of treasury of universal knowledge in the form of poems connected  
    by lengthy prose commentaries. At the same time he worked upon  
    the De Vulgari Eloquentia, a Latin treatise in which he defended  
    the use of Italian as a literary language.
  - |-
    The election of Henry of Luxembourg as emperor in 1308 stirred Dante's political hopes. When Henry entered Italy in 1310 at the head of an army, Dante in an epistle to the princes and people of Italy hailed the coming of a deliverer. At Milan he paid personal homage to Henry as his sovereign. When Florence, in alliance with King Robert of Naples, prepared to resist the emperor, Dante in a second epistle denounced them for their obstinacy and prophesied their doom. In a third epistle he upbraided the Emperor himself for his delay and urged him on against Florence. It was probably during this period that he wrote his De Monarchia, an intellectual defense of the emperor as the sovereign of the temporal order. The death of Henry in 1313, after a year or so of ineffective fighting, brought an end to the political aspirations of Dante and his party. The city of Florence in 1311 and again in 1315 renewed his condemnation.
    
    After Henry's death, Dante passed the rest of his life under the protection of various lords of Lombardy, Tuscany, and the Romagna. According to one tradition, he retired for a time to the monastery of Santa Croce di Fonte Avellana in the Apennines, where he worked on the Divine Comedy, which may have been planned as early as 1292. He was almost certainly for a time at the court of Can Grande della Scala, to whom he dedicated the Paradiso. In 1315 Florence issued a general recall of exiles. Dante refused to pay the required fine and to "bear the brand of oblation," feeling that such a return would derogate from his fame and honor. To the end of his life he appears to have hoped that his Comedy would finally open the gates of the city to him.
  - |-
    The last few years of the poet's life were spent at Ravenna,
    under the patronage of Guido da Polenta, a nephew of Francesca
    da Rimini. Dante's daughter, Beatrice, was a nun in that city, and
    one of his sons held a benefice there; his wife seems to have re-
    sided in Florence throughout his exile. Dante was greatly esteemed
    at Ravenna and enjoyed a congenial circle of friends. Here he com-
    pleted the Divine Comedy and wrote two eclogues in Latin which
    382 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    indicate that a certain continent surrounded his closing days.
    Returning from a diplomatic mission to Venice on behalf of his
    patron, he caught a fever and died September 14, 1321. He was
    buried at Ravenna before the door of the principal church, with
    the highest honors, and "in the habit of a poet and a great philoso-
    pher."
    
    Now spend about ten minutes pre-reading or skimming
    the following table of contents systematically. The text used

    The last five questions in Test D, which deal mainly with the symbolism of Dante's Divine Comedy, may be difficult or even impossible to answer on the basis of reading the table of contents alone. For that reason, if for no other, we have provided quite full answers to these questions. The justification for asking such questions is twofold. First, we are not certain that they cannot be answered from the table of contents alone. Second, and more important, they are designed to suggest one of the major characteristics of Dante's great work: that is, that it is symbolic through and through. Almost every statement Dante makes, and almost every person and event he describes, has at least two meanings, and often three or four. We think that fact is probably clear from reading the table of contents alone, even if the details are not all spelled out. Hence it might be interesting to try to answer Questions 6-10 in this test without any outside help whatever even if you have never read Dante before or read about him. In other words, if you have to guess, how close are your guesses?

    The biography of Charles Darwin and the table of contents of his *The Origin of Species* that appear on the following pages are taken from Volume 49 of *Great Books of the Western World*. Besides *The Origin of Species*, that volume also contains *The Descent of Man*, in which Darwin applied his general theory, as expounded in the Origin, to the puzzling question of the evolution of the human species.
    
    As in the case of Dante, read the biography of Darwin quickly—in five or six minutes—and then skim or pre-read the table of contents of *The Origin of Species*, devoting no more than ten minutes to the task.
    
    **Charles Darwin**
    1809–1882
    
    In evaluating the qualities that accounted for his "success as a man of science," Charles Darwin in his modest autobiography, written "because it might possibly interest my children," traces from his early youth "the strongest desire to understand and explain" whatever he observed. His childhood fantasies were concerned with fabulous discoveries in natural history; to his schoolmates he boasted that he could produce variously colored flowers of the same plant by watering them with certain colored fluids.
    
    His father, a highly successful physician, was somewhat puzzled by the singular interest of his second son as well as by his undistinguished career in the classical curriculum of Dr. Butler's day school; he accordingly decided to send him to Edinburgh to study medicine. At Edinburgh Darwin collected animals in tidal pools, trawled for oysters with Newhaven fishermen to obtain specimens, and made two small discoveries which he incorporated in papers read before the Plinian Society. He put forth no very "strenuous effort" to learn medicine.
    
    **Appendix B 393**

    With some asperity, Dr. Darwin proposed the vocation of clergyman as an alternative. The life of a country clergyman appealed to young Darwin, and, after quieting his doubts concerning his belief in "all the dogmas of the Church," he began this new career at Cambridge. He proved unable, however, to repress his scientific interests and developed into an ardent entomologist, particularly devoted to collecting beetles; he had the satisfaction of seeing one of his rare specimens published in Stephen's Illustrations of British Insects. As at Edinburgh, he enjoyed many stimulating associations with men of science. It was a professor of botany at Cambridge, J. S. Henslow, who arranged for his appointment as naturalist on the government ship, H. M. S. Beagle.
    
    From 1831 to 1836 the Beagle voyaged in Southern waters. Lyell's researches into the changes wrought by natural processes, set forth in Principles of Geology, gave direction to Darwin's own observations of the geological structure of the Cape Verde Islands. He also made extensive examinations of coral reefs and noted the relations of animals on the mainland to those of the adjacent islands, as well as the relation of living animals to the fossil remains of the same species.
    
    Darwin described the voyage of the Beagle as "by far the most important event in my life." Besides making him one of the best qualified naturalists of his day, it developed in him the "habit of energetic industry and of concentrated attention." This new purposefulness on the part of his son was succinctly noted by Dr. Darwin, who remarked upon first seeing him after the voyage: "Why, the shape of his head is quite altered."
  - |-
    After his return, Darwin settled in London and began the task of organizing and recording his observations. He became a close friend of Lyell, the leading English geologist, and later of Hooker, an outstanding botanist. In 1839 he married his cousin, Emma Wedgwood, and toward the end of 1842, because of Darwin's chronic ill-health, the family moved to Down, where he lived in seclusion for the rest of his days. During the six years in London, he prepared his Journal from the notes of the voyage and published his carefully documented study of Coral Reefs.
    
    The next eight years were spent in the laborious classification of barnacles for his four-volume work on that subject. "I have been struck," he wrote to Hooker, "with the variability of every part in some slight degree of every species." After this period of detailed work with a single species, Darwin felt prepared to attack the problem of the modification of species which he had been pondering for many years.
    
    A number of facts had come to light during the voyage of the Beagle that Darwin felt "could only be explained on the supposition that species gradually become modified." Later, after his return to England, he had collected all the material he could find which "bore in any way on the variation of plants and animals under domestication." He soon perceived "that selection was the keystone of man's success. But how selection could be applied to organisms living in a state of nature remained for some time a mystery." One day, while reading Malthus on Population, it suddenly occurred to him how, in the struggle for existence, which he had everywhere observed, "favorable variations would tend to be preserved and unfavorable ones to be destroyed. The result would be the formation of a new species. Here then I had at last a theory by which to work.

    He confided this theory to Hooker and Lyell, who urged him
    to write out his views for publication. But Darwin worked deliber-
    ately; he was only half through his projected book, when in the sum-
    mer of 1858, he received an essay from A. R. Wallace at Ternate in
    the Moluccas, containing exactly the same theory as his own. Darwin
    submitted his dilemma to Hooker and Lyell, to whom he wrote:
    "Your words have come true with a vengeance—that I should be
    forestalled." It was their decision to publish an abstract of his
    theory from a letter of the previous year together with Wallace's
    essay, the joint work being entitled: On the Tendency of Species
    to form Varieties and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species
    by Natural Means of Selection.
    
    A year later, on November 24, 1859, The Origin of Species
    appeared. The entire first edition of 1,250 copies was sold on the
    day of publication. A storm of controversy arose over the book,
    reaching its height at a meeting of the British Association at Oxford,
    where the celebrated verbal duel between T. H. Huxley and Bishop
    Wilberforce took place. Darwin, who could not sleep when he an-
    swered an antagonist harshly, took Lyell's advice and saved both
    "time and temper" by avoiding the fray.
    
    In his work, however, he stayed close to his thesis. He ex-
    panded the material of the first chapter of the Origin into a book,
    Variation of Plants and Animals under Domestication (1868). In
    The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871), Dar-
    win fulfilled his statement in the Origin that "light would be thrown
    on the origin of man and his history." The Expression of the Emo-
    tions (1872) offered a natural explanation of phenomena which
    appeared to be a difficulty in the way of acceptance of evolution.
    His last works were concerned with the form, movement, and fer-
    tilization of plants.
  - |-
    Darwin's existence at Down was peculiarly adapted to preserve
    his energy and give direct order to his activity. Because of his con-
    tinual ill-health, his wife took pains "to shield him from every
    avoidable annoyance." He observed the same routine for nearly
    forty years, his days being carefully parcelled into intervals of
    exercise and light reading in such proportions that he could utilize
    to his fullest capacity the four hours he devoted to work. His scien-
    tific reading and experimentation, as well, were organized with the
    most rigorous economy. Even the phases of his intellectual life
    non-essential to his work became, as he put it, "atrophied," a fact
    which he regretted as "a loss of happiness." Such non-scientific
    reading as he did was purely for relaxation, and he thought that "a
    law ought to be passed" against unhappy endings to novels.
    
    With his wife and seven children his manner was so unusually
    "affectionate and delightful" that his son, Francis, marvelled that he
    could preserve it "with such an undemonstrative race as we are."
    When he died on April 19, 1882, his family wanted him to be
    buried at Down; public feeling decreed that he should be interred
    in Westminster Abbey, where he was laid beside Sir Isaac Newton.

Species of the larger genera in each country vary more frequently than the species of the smaller genera. Many of the species of the larger genera resemble varieties in being very closely, but unequally, related to each other, and in having restricted ranges.  
    
    CHAPTER III. STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE  
    Its bearing on natural selection. The term used in a wide sense. Geometrical ratio of increase. Rapid increase of naturalized animals and plants. Nature of the checks to increase. Competition universal. Effects of climate. Protection from the number of individuals. Complex relations of all animals and plants throughout nature. Struggle for life most severe between individuals and varieties of the same species: often severe between species of the same genus. The relation of organism to organism the most important of all relations.  
    
    CHAPTER IV. NATURAL SELECTION;  
    OR THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST  
    Natural selection. Its power compared with man's selection. Its power on characters of trifling importance. Its power at all ages and on both sexes. Sexual selection. On the generality of intercrosses between individuals of the same species. Circumstances favourable and unfavourable to the results of Natural Selection, namely, intercrossing, isolation, number of individuals. Slow action. Extinction caused by natural selection. Divergence of character, related to the diversity of inhabitants of any small area, and to naturalisation. Action of natural selection, through divergence of character and extinction, on the descendants from a common parent. Explains the grouping of all organic beings. Advance in organisation. Low forms preserved. Convergence of character. Indefinite multiplication of species. Summary.  
    
    CHAPTER V. LAWS OF VARIATION
  - |-
    Effects of changed conditions. Use and disuse, combined with natural selection; organs of flight and of vision. Acclimatisation. Correlated variation. Compensation and economy of growth. False correlations. Multiple, rudimentary, and lowly organised structures variable. Parts developed in an unusual manner are highly variable; specific characters more variable than generic: secondary sexual characters variable. Species of the same genus vary in an analogous manner. Reversions to long-lost characters. Summary.

    Chapter VI. DIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORY
    
    Difficulties of the theory of descent with modification. Absence or rarity of transitional varieties. Transitions in habits of life. Diversified habits in the same species. Species with habits widely different from those of their allies. Organs of extreme perfection. Modes of transition. Cases of difficulty. Natura non facit saltum. Organs of small importance. Organs not in all cases absolutely perfect. The law of unity of type and of the conditions of existence embraced by the theory of natural selection.
    
    CHAPTER VII. MISCELLANEOUS OBJECTIONS TO THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION
    
    Longevity. Modifications not necessarily simultaneous. Modifications apparently of no direct service. Progressive development. Characters of small functional importance, the most constant. Supposed incompetence of natural selection to account for the incipient stages of useful structures. Causes which interfere with the acquisition through natural selection of useful structures.

Reasons for disbelieving in great and abrupt modifications.
    
    CHAPTER VIII. INSTINCT
    
    Instincts comparable with habits, but different in their origin. Instincts graduated. Aphides and ants. Instincts variable. Domestic instincts, their origin. Natural instincts of the cuckoo, molothrus, ostrich, and parasitic bees. Slavemaking ants. Hive-bee, its cell-making instinct. Changes of instinct and structure not necessarily simultaneous. Difficulties of the theory of the natural selection of instincts. Neuter or sterile insects. Summary.
    
    CHAPTER IX. HYBRIDISM
  - |-
    Distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids.
    Sterility various in degree, not universal, affected by close inter-
    breeding, removed by domestication. Laws governing the sterility
    of hybrids. Sterility not a special endowment, but incidental on
    other differences, not accumulated by natural selection. Causes of
    the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. Parallelism between the

    Test E: Questions about Darwin and  
    about The Origin of Species
    
    1. In The Origin of Species Darwin undertakes to describe  
    the origin and evolution of man. (True or False?)
    
    2. The work is divided into (a) 12 (b) 15 (c) 19 chapters.
  - |-
    3. The book emphasizes the role of domestication in natural selection. (True or False? )
    
    4. Darwin asserts that the struggle for life is (a) more severe (b) less severe between individuals of the same species than it is between individuals of different species.
    
    5. Darwin takes no account of, and does not try to answer, difficulties of and objections against his theory. (True or False? )

    Those questions were all very easy ones. Now take another twenty minutes to read the table of contents of The Origin of Species (see p. 395) superficially, and then we will ask you to consider some more difficult questions.
    
    Test F: Further questions about Darwin and The Origin of Species
    
    1. Darwin, making extensive use of the geological record, considers it (a) complete and satisfactory (b) incomplete but an invaluable source of data on the origin of species.
    
    2. Species refers to a group of animals or plants (a) lower (b) higher than a genus.
    
    3. Members of a species share common characteristics, and can interbreed and reproduce their kinds. (True or False? )
    
    4. Members of a genus share common characteristics, but are not necessarily able to interbreed and reproduce their kind. (True or False? )
  - |-
    5. Of the following factors, which ones play a major role and which a minor role in natural selection?
    
    MAJOR MINOR
    (a) The struggle for existence
    (b) Variation of individuals = — a
    (c) Heritability of traits _—___ —_—_
    
    Appendix B 401
    
    6. Darwin compares the power of natural selection to that of man's selection. Which does he think is greater?
    
    7. The Latin phrase Natura non facit saltum appears in the table of contents. Can you translate this phrase? Can you state the significance of the phrase for Darwin's theory?
    
    8. What is the significance of geological dispersion and of natural barriers such as the oceans on the evolution of species?
    
    9. In his Introduction to The Origin of Species, Darwin refers to the origin of species as "that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers." Can you state fairly exactly the problem that his work sets out to solve? You might try to do this in no more than a sentence or two.
    
    10. What is Darwin's theory—in a nutshell? Can you state it in no more than 100 words?

    You have now completed the two-part exercise at the second level of reading. As before, you will have noted that the questions draw not only on the texts read but also on historical and other information. Indeed, you may feel that some of the questions were eminently unfair. And so they would be, if any critical decision depended on your ability to answer them. That, of course, is not so. We hope that the questions you were unable to answer, or that you found it very difficult to answer, will not irritate you, but will instead lead you to search in the works that have been only superficially discussed here for better answers than the ones we have given. Better answers are available in the works themselves. And also answers to many more interesting questions that we have not had the time, the space, or the wit, to ask.

    III. Exercises and Tests at the Third Level
    of Reading: Analytical Reading
  - |-
    The text used for the exercises in this part of the Appendix  
    is this book itself. We would prefer it if this were not so.  
    There are many books that it would be better and more fruit-  
    ful to practice analytical reading on. But over against that  
    preference there is one overriding consideration: this book is  
    the only one that we can be sure that all persons taking this  
    test have read. The only alternative would be to reprint an-  
    other book along with this one, and that is out of the ques-  
    tion.
    
    You will recall that the analytical reader must always  
    attempt to answer four questions about whatever book he is  
    reading: (1) What is the book about as a whole? (2) What is  
    being said in detail, and how? (3) Is the book true, in whole  
    or part? (4) What of it? The fifteen rules of reading, as they  
    are listed on pp. 163-64 and discussed at length in Part Two,  
    are designed to help the analytical reader answer these ques-  
    tions. Can you answer them about this book?
    
    You must be the judge of whether you can or not. There  
    are no answers at the end of this Appendix to these four ques-  
    tions. The answers are in the book itself.
    
    Not only is it true that we have done the best job we  
    could of making these matters clear in writing the book. It is  
    also true that in an important sense it would be inappropriate  
    to try to help you any more than we already have. Not only  
    is analytical reading work—it is lonely work. The reader is  
    alone with the book he is reading. Basically, there is no re-  
    source to exploit except his own thought; there is no place  
    to go for insight and understanding except into his own mind.
    
    We have explained how the questions must be answered  
    for, and the rules applied to, different kinds of books. But we  
    cannot state how they are to be applied to any given work.  
    The reader himself must be the one to do that.
    
    There are, nevertheless, a few things that can be said with-  
    out hesitation. First, the book is about the art of reading,  
    particularly analytical reading. It explains how to read a  
    book in order to understand it fully, and how to use the  
    rules of reading to achieve that understanding. It also explains  
    the nature of analytical reading and the difference between  
    analytical and superficial reading. The book is structured  
    in a way that guides the reader through the process of analy-  
    tical reading, from the initial stages of reading to the more  
    advanced techniques. It provides a framework for under-  
    standing how to approach different types of books and how  
    to apply the rules of reading in various contexts. The book  
    is also concerned with the role of the reader in the process  
    of reading, emphasizing that the reader must be active and  
    engaged in order to truly understand a book. Finally, the  
    book is written in a clear and accessible manner, making it  
    suitable for readers of all levels.

    out exceeding the proprieties. We have not concealed the fact
    that this is a practical book, so applying the first rule of struc-
    tural analysis is easy enough. We think we have also made it
    pretty clear what the book is about as a whole, although now
    you should state this more briefly than we have done in any
    one place. We hope that our organization into four parts and
    twenty-one chapters is perspicuous. However, in outlining the
    book, it might be desirable to comment on the unequal treat-
    ment, in terms of numbers of pages, accorded the various
    levels of reading. The first level of reading—elementary reading
    —receives relatively short shrift in this book, although it is of
    undoubted importance. Why? The third level of reading—ana-
    lytical reading—receives much more extensive and intensive
    coverage than any of the other levels. Again, why?
    
    With regard to the fourth rule of structural analysis, we
    want to emphasize that the problem we set out to solve can-
    not be defined simply as teaching you to read. There is nothing
    in this book, for example, that would be of much help to a
    first- or second-grade teacher. We have concentrated instead
    on reading in a certain way, and with certain goals in mind.
    In applying the fourth rule of reading, that way and those
    goals should be described with precision.
    
    Similarly with the second stage of analytical reading—
    interpretation. The first three rules at that stage must be ap-
    plied by the reader without our help: the rules that require you
    to come to terms, to find the key propositions, and to construct
    the arguments. There would be no point in our trying to list
    what we think are the terms of this work—the important words
    that must be understood commonly by you and by us if the
    work as a whole is to communicate knowledge, or impart
    skill. Nor will we repeat the propositions that we have as-
    serted, and that the reader, if he has read analytically, should
    be able to state in his own words. Nor will we repeat the
    arguments. To do so would be to write the book over again.
  - |-
    Something can be said, however, about the problems that
    we did and did not solve. We believe we did solve the main
    problem that faced us at the beginning—the problem that you
    404 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    must have identified in your application of the fourth rule of
    structural analysis. We do not believe that we solved all of the
    problems of reading that face students and adult readers to-
    day. For one thing, many of these problems involve individual
    differences between human beings. No book on a general sub-
    ject can ever hope to solve such difficulties.
    
    The criticism of a book as a communication of knowledge
    involves, as you will recall, the application of seven rules,
    three of which are general maxims of intellectual etiquette,
    and four of which are specific criteria for points of criticism.
    We have done what we could to recommend the maxims of
    intellectual etiquette (they are discussed in Chapter 10). With
    regard to the first three points of criticism, we can have nothing
    to say. But a few remarks about the last of the four criteria
    of criticism—to show wherein the analysis in the book is incom-
    plete—are not inappropriate.
    
    We would say that our analysis or account is incomplete
    in two respects. The first is in regard to the first level of read-
    ing. There is much more to be said about elementary reading,
    but we do want to emphasize that that was not our primary
    concern. Nor would we claim for our discussion of the subject
    any degree of finality. Elementary reading could be discussed,
    and has been discussed, in quite different ways.
    
    The other respect in which our analysis is incomplete is
    much more important. We did not say all that could be said—
    perhaps not even all that we could say—about syntopical read-
    ing. There are two reasons for this.
    
    First, syntopical reading is extraordinarily hard to describe
    and explain without having the texts of various authors in front
    of one. Fortunately, we will have the opportunity in the last
    part of this Appendix, which follows, of presenting an actual
    exercise in syntopical reading. But even there we will be con-
    fined to two short texts by only two authors. A full-scale exer-
    cise would involve many texts from many authors, and the
    examination of many complex questions. Space limitations pro-
    hibit that here.
  - |-
    Second, it is almost impossible to describe the intellectual
    Appendix B 405
    
    excitement and satisfaction that come from syntopical read-
    ing without actually sharing the experience of doing it. Nor
    is the understanding that one finally arrives at attained in a
    day. Often, it takes months or years to unwind the twisted
    thread of the discussion of an important point, a thread that
    may have been in the process of becoming twisted over cen-
    turies. Many false starts are made, and many tentative analyses
    and organizations of the discussions must be proposed, before
    any real light is thrown on the subject. We have suffered
    through many of these problems, and we know how disheart-
    ening the business can be at times. As a result, however, we
    also know how wonderful it can be when one finally wins one's
    way through to a solution.
    
    Are there other respects in which our analysis is incom-
    plete? We can think of a few possibilities. For example, does
    the book fail to differentiate sufficiently between what might
    be called first-intentional reading (that is, reading a text) and
    second-intentional reading (that is, reading a commentary on
    that text)? Is enough said about reading heretical in contra-
    distinction to canonical texts; or enough about the reading of
    texts that stand detached, above so-called canonical and hereti-
    cal texts? Is enough attention paid to the problems raised by
    special vocabularies, especially in science and mathematics?
    (This aspect of the general problem of reading is mentioned in
    the chapter on reading social science.) Perhaps not enough
    space is devoted to the reading of lyric poetry. Beyond that,
    we are not sure that we know of anything that deserves criti-
    cism on this last count. But we would not be surprised to dis-
    cover that some defects or failures that are not at all obvious
    to us are perfectly obvious to you.
    
    IV. Exercises and Tests at the Fourth Level
    of Reading: Syntopical Reading
    
    Two texts are used for the exercises in this fourth and
    last part of the Appendix. One consists of selected passages
  - |-
    From the first two chapters of Book I of Aristotle's Politics.
    The other consists of selected passages from Book I of Rous-
    seau's The Social Contract—a sentence from the Introduction
    to the book, and passages from Chapters 1, 2, 4, and 6.
    
    Aristotle's Politics appears in Volume 9 of Great Books of
    the Western World. Volumes 8 and 9 of the set are devoted
    to the complete works of Aristotle; besides the Politics, Vol-
    ume 9 includes the Ethics, the Rhetoric, and the Poetics, as
    well as a number of biological treatises. Rousseau's Social
    Contract appears in Volume 38 of the set, a volume that in-
    cludes other works by Rousseau as well—the essay On the
    Origin of Inequality, and On Political Economy—together with
    another important eighteenth-century French political book,
    Montesquieu's The Spirit of Laws.
    
    You will recall that there are two stages of syntopical
    reading. One is a preparatory step, the other is syntopical
    reading proper. For the purposes of this exercise we assume
    that the first or preparatory step has already been taken—that
    is, that we have decided on the subject we wish to consider
    and have also decided on the texts we want to read. The
    subject in this case may be defined as "The Nature and Origin
    of the State'—a subject of importance about which a great
    deal has been thought and said. The texts are as described
    above.
    
    We must assume further, if this exercise is not to exceed
    the limits set by the space available to us, that we have nar-
    rowed the question to be considered here, with the help of
    these two texts, to a single inquiry, which can be stated as
    follows: Is the State a natural arrangement, with all that that
    implies of goodness and necessity—or is it merely a conven-
    tional or artificial arrangement?
    
    That is our question. Now read the two texts carefully,
    taking as much time as you wish or need. Speed is never im-
    portant in syntopical reading. Make notes if you want to, and
    underline or otherwise mark passages when that seems desir-
    able. And return to the texts as often as you wish in consider-
    ing the questions that follow.
    
    Appendix B 407
  - |-
    From Book I or Aristotle's Politics
    
    FRoM CHAPTER 1  
    Every state is a community of some kind, and every com-  
    munity is established with a view of some good; for mankind al-  
    ways act in order to obtain that which they think good. But, if all  
    communities aim at some good, the state or political community,  
    which is the highest of all, and which embraces all the rest, aims at  
    good in a greater degree than any other, and at the highest good. .. .
    
    FROM CHAPTER 2  
    
    The family is the association established by nature for the  
    supply of men's everyday wants, and the members of it are called  
    by Charondas ‘companions of the cupboard', and by Epimenides the  
    Cretan, ‘companions of the manger'. But when several families are  
    united, and the association aims at something more than the sup-  
    ply of daily needs, the first society to be formed is the village. And  
    the most natural form of the village appears to be that of a colony  
    from the family, composed of the children and grandchildren, who  
    are said to be ‘suckled with the same milk'. And this is the reason  
    why Hellenic states were originally governed by kings; because the  
    Hellenes were under royal rule before they came together, as the  
    barbarians still are... .
    
    When several villages are united in a single complete com-  
    munity, large enough to be nearly or quite self-sufficing, the state  
    comes into existence, originating in the bare needs of life, and  
    continuing in existence for the sake of a good life. And therefore,  
    if the earlier forms of society are natural, so is the state, for it is the  
    end of them, and the nature of a thing is its end. For what each  
    thing is when fully developed, we call its nature, whether we are  
    speaking of a man, a horse, or a family. Besides, the final cause  
    and end of a thing is the best, and to be self-sufficing is the end  
    and the best.
    
    Hence it is evident that the state is a creation of nature, and  
    that man is by nature a political animal... .
  - |-
    Now, that man is more of a political animal than bees or any other gregarious animals is evident. Nature, as we often say, makes nothing in vain, and man is the only animal whom she has endowed with the gift of speech. And whereas mere voice is but an indication of pleasure or pain, and is therefore found in other animals (for their nature attains to the perception of pleasure and pain and the intimation of them to one another, and no further), the power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and in-expedient, and therefore likewise the just and the unjust. And it is a characteristic of man that he alone has any sense of good and evil, of just and unjust, and the like, and the association of living beings who have this sense makes a family and a state.
    
    Further, the state is by nature clearly prior to the family and to the individual, since the whole is of necessity prior to the part; for example, if the whole body be destroyed, there will be no foot or hand, except in an equivocal sense, as we might speak of a stone hand; for when destroyed the hand will be no better than that. But things are defined by their working and power; and we ought not to say that they are the same when they no longer have their proper quality, but only that they have the same name. The proof that the state is a creation of nature and prior to the individual is that the individual, when isolated, is not self-sufficing; and therefore he is like a part in relation to the whole. But he who is unable to live in society, or who has no need because he is sufficient for himself, must be either a beast or a god: he is no part of a state. A social instinct is implanted in all men by nature, and yet he who first founded the state was the greatest of benefactors. For man, when perfected, is the best of animals, but, when separated from law and justice, he is the worst of all.

    From CHAPTER |. SUBJECT OF THE First BOOK
    Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains. One thinks
    himself the master of others, and still remains a greater slave than
    they. How did this change come about? I do not know. What can
    make it legitimate? That question I think I can answer... .
    
    From CHAPTER 2. THE FIRST SOCIETIES
    The most ancient of all societies, and the only one that is
    natural, is the family: and even so the children remain attached
    to the father only so long as they need him for their preservation.
    As soon as this need ceases, the natural bond is dissolved. The
    children, released from the obedience they owed to the father, and
    the father, released from the care he owed his children, return
    equally to independence. If they remain united, they continue so
    no longer naturally, but voluntarily; and the family itself is then
    maintained only by convention. . . .
    
    The family then may be called the first model of political so-
    cieties: the ruler corresponds to the father, and the people to the
    children; and all, being born free and equal, alienate their liberty
    only for their own advantage. .. .
    
    From CHAPTER 4. SLAVERY
    Since no man has a natural authority over his fellow, and force
    creates no right, we must conclude that conventions form the basis
    of all legitimate authority among men... .
    
    From CHAPTER 6. THE SOCIAL COMPACT
    
    I suppose men to have reached the point at which the ob-
    stacles in the way of their preservation in the state of nature show
    their power of resistance to be greater than the resources at the
    disposal of each individual for his maintenance in that state. That
    primitive condition can then subsist no longer; and the human
    race would perish unless it changed its manner of existence.
  - |-
    But, as men cannot engender new forces, but only unite and  
    direct existing ones, they have no other means of preserving them-  
    selves than the formation, by aggregation, of a sum of forces great  
    enough to overcome the resistance. These they have to bring into  
    play by means of a single motive power, and cause to act in con-  
    cert.
    
    This sum of forces can arise only where several persons come  
    together: but, as the force and liberty of each man are the chief  
    instruments of his self-preservation, how can he pledge them with-  
    out harming his own interests, and neglecting the care he owes to  
    himself? This difficulty, in its bearing on my present subject, may  
    be stated in the following terms:
    
    "The problem is to find a form of association which will defend  
    and protect with the whole common force the person and goods of  
    each associate, and in which each, while uniting himself with all, may still obey himself alone, and remain as free as before." This  
    is the fundamental problem of which the Social Contract provides  
    the solution. . ..

    "Each of us puts his person and all his power in common  
    under the supreme direction of the general will, and, in our corpo-  
    rate capacity, we receive each member as an indivisible part of the  
    whole."

    Here is the text with all formatting errors fixed and presented verbatim:
    
    At once, in place of the individual personality of each contracting party, this act of association creates a moral and collective body, composed of as many members as the assembly contains votes, and receiving from this act its unity, its common identity, its life and its will. This public person, so formed by the union of all other persons, formerly took the name of city (polis), and now takes that of Republic or body politic; it is called by its members State when passive, Sovereign when active, and Power when compared with others like itself. Those who are associated in it take collectively the name of people, and severally are called citizens, as sharing in the sovereign power, and subjects, as being under the laws of the State. But these terms are often confused and taken one for another: it is enough to know how to distinguish them when they are being used with precision.
    
    We will ask you to entertain two sets of questions about these two texts, after which we will suggest some tentative conclusions that we believe can justifiably be drawn from the texts.
    
    Test G: Here is the first set of questions about Aristotle and Rousseau
    
    1. Aristotle identifies three different types of human association. What are they?
    
    2. These three types of association have certain things in common and also differ in significant respects. What do they have in common and how do they differ?
    
    3. The three types of association differ in regard to their inclusiveness. Can you order them on a scale going from less to more inclusive?
    
    4. All three types of association aim at fulfilling some natural need—that is, they achieve some good. The good achieved by the family—that is, the security of its members and the perpetuation of the race—is also achieved by the village, but in a higher degree. Is the good aimed at or achieved by the state merely the same good in an even higher degree, or is it a different good altogether?
    
    5. Another way to get at this difference is by still another question. Given that, for Aristotle, all three types of association are natural, are they natural in the same way?
  - |-
    6. Before turning to some questions about Rousseau in this first set of questions, we must mention the one remark of Aristotle's that raises a difficulty. Aristotle praises highly the man who first founded the state. Would he speak similarly of the man who first founded the family or the village?
    
    7. What is the main problem that Rousseau poses about the state?
    
    8. Does Rousseau pose this same problem about the family?
    
    9. What is the opposite of the natural for Rousseau?
    
    10. What is the basic or founding convention that, for Rousseau, makes the state legitimate?
    
    Turn to p. 416 for the answers to Test G.
    
    After this first set of questions about the two texts, we appear to have arrived at an interpretation of the two texts that sees them in disagreement on the question we have been considering. That question is, as you will recall: Is the state natural, or is it conventional or artificial? Rousseau appears to say that the state is conventional or artificial; Aristotle appears to say that it is natural.
    
    Now take a few moments to consider whether this interpretation is correct. Is there anything about the problematic remark of Aristotle's we mentioned that calls the interpretation in doubt? Is there anything that Rousseau says that we have not discussed and that also must cause us to doubt this interpretation?
    
    412 HOW TO READ A BOOK
    
    If you see why this interpretation is not correct, you will probably already have anticipated the few remaining questions we want to ask.
    
    Test H: Here is the second set of questions
    
    1. For Rousseau, is the state natural as well as conventional?
    
    2. Does Aristotle agree in this?
    
    3. Can this basic agreement between Aristotle and Rousseau be extended to further points?
    
    4. In the answer to the last question, we spoke of the "good" that the state achieves which cannot be achieved without it. Is this "good" the same for Rousseau as for Aristotle?
    
    5. One final question. Does the agreement we have found on our primary question mean that these two texts, short as they are, are in agreement on all points?
    
    Turn to p. 418 for the answers to Test H.
  - |-
    We said at the beginning of this exercise that there are
    certain conclusions that can justifiably be drawn from the
    careful reading of these two important political texts. Among
    them are these: First, it is a basic truth about man that he is a
    political animal—you may use some other adjective if you wish
    —as contradistinguished from other social or gregarious ani-
    mals: that is, that man is a rational social animal who con-
    stitutes a society to serve other than merely biological ends.
    It follows from this that the state is both natural and conven-
    tional—that it is both more and less natural than the family;
    and it follows also that the state must be formally constituted:
    other societies are not true states. Second, we may reasonably
    conclude that the state is a means, not an end. The end is the
    common human good: a good life. Hence man is not made for
    the state, but the state for man.
    
    Appendix B 413
    
    These conclusions seem to us to be justified, and we also
    believe that the answers we have given to the questions are
    correct. But more than feeling or belief is required in a genu-
    ine project of syntopical reading. We noted, in our discussion
    of this level of reading, that it is always desirable to document
    one's answers and conclusions from the texts of the authors
    themselves. We have not done that here. You might want to
    try to do it for yourself. If you are puzzled by any of our
    answers, see if you can find the passage or passages in the text,
    either by Aristotle or Rousseau, that must have formed the
    basis of the answer we give. And if you disagree with any of
    our answers or conclusions, see if you can document your dis-
    agreement by means of the words of the authors themselves.

    The first answer ("Why apples fall") might have been con-
    sidered correct if it had been phrased "How apples fall," al-
    though of course there is no mention of apples in the Principia.
    The point is that the work describes gravity and expounds its

    and (c) 10. This striking statement has impressed generations
    of Newton idolaters. In commenting on it, you probably dis-
    cussed the modesty of its author. Did you also make any men-
    tion of the metaphor that Newton employs? It is a memorable
    one.

    1. (a) 2. (b) Dante's own titles were the ones that appear  
    in (c); if you gave that as your answer we would therefore  
    have to count it as correct. 3. (a) 4. (a) and (b) 5. (b) This  
    is no accident, of course. Each major division of the poem  
    (called in Italian a cantiche) contains 33 cantos: the first

    Eighth Circle is divided into pouches. 7. (b) Circles (a) is  
    not really wrong. 8. (c) But (b) would also be correct, as in  
    Dante's cosmology the nine orders of angels correspond to the

    I. (b) 2. (a) Beatrice acts for God, so (b) is not incorrect. 3. (b) 4. (b) and (c) Dante had not read Aristotle's Poetics, though he had read a synopsis of it suggesting that Aristotle defined a comedy as any work that ends fortunately. Dante's poem ends in Heaven, hence fortunately, and therefore he titled it The Comedy: but of course it is not a comic work. 5. (c) The poem is dependent on all three, but the Christian themes are the most important. 6. Yes. Dante felt that sloth had been one of his main sins, and he here symbolizes this by falling asleep. 7. In Dante's cosmology, the earth is the center of the universe, and Hell is at the center of the earth. 8. The P's stand for the Latin word peccata, sins: there are seven P's because there are seven deadly sins, from each of which the souls are absolved in their ascent up the Mountain of Purgatory. 9. Virgil, in the poem, is the symbol of all human knowledge and virtue. But, as a pagan who died before the birth of Christ, he cannot accompany Dante into Paradise. 10. The Franciscans and the Dominicans were the two great monastic orders of the Middle Ages. The Franciscans were contemplatives, the Dominicans were scholars and teachers. Dante here symbolizes the heavenly resolution of all differences between the two orders by having St. Thomas, the greatest representative of the Dominicans, narrate the life of St. Francis, the founder of the Franciscans; while St. Bonaventura, the representative of the Franciscans, narrates the life of St. Dominic, the founder of the Dominicans.

    Test F (p. 400)
    
    1, (b) 2. (a) 3. True. In fact, this comes close to being the definition of a species. 4. True. Members of a genus can interbreed and reproduce their kind only if they are also members of the same species. 5. (a), (b), and (c) all play major roles in natural selection. 6. Natural selection. Would Darwin change his mind if he were alive today, in the face of the evidence of man's destructive effect on the environment? Perhaps. But he might still continue to insist that in the long run, nature is more powerful than man. And then, too, man is himself a part of nature. 7. The phrase can be translated "Nature makes no jumps —that is, sudden, great and abrupt variations do not occur naturally, but only small and gradual ones. Even if you were not able to translate the Latin, was the sense of this statement clear from the table of contents? The idea is significant because Darwin, taking it as true, explains the fact that there is great differentiation between species by the hypothesis of gaps in the geological record—so-called missing links—instead of by the hypothesis of created differences between species. 8. According to Darwin, if two varieties of a single species are widely separated over a considerable period of time so that they are physically hindered from interbreeding, the varieties tend to become separate species—that is, become incapable of interbreeding. It was his discovery of quite distinct species of birds on the oceanic islands during his service on the Beagle that first led him to see this fundamental point. 9. There are probably many ways to state the problem, but one way to do it is to ask two apparently simple questions.
  - |-
    First, why are there many kinds of living things, instead of just one or a few? Second, how does a species come into existence, and how does it pass away—which, Darwin and his contemporaries knew from the geological record, had happened many times? It may be necessary to think about these questions for a while to realize why they are so very difficult and so very mysterious—but they are well worth thinking about. 10. We are not sure that an adequate answer to this question can be arrived at on the basis of a mere perusal, however intensive, of the table of contents of The Origin of Species. If you were able to state the theory in a hundred words without having read the book, you are an extraordinary reader. Indeed, the question is not easy to answer briefly even if one has read the book; you might refer to our attempt to summarize the theory in Chapter 7. In a short passage in his own Introduction to the work, Darwin may have done it himself, and we quote the passage in its entirety here for what it is worth:
    
    As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitably to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.
    
    Test G (p. 410)
    
    1. The family, the village, the state.
    
    2. They have in common that they are all modes of human association and that they are all natural. Aristotle is clear on the latter point: "It is evident," he says, "that the state is a creation of nature." However, the differences between the types of association are important. If you have not yet identified these differences, as Aristotle describes them, some further questions may be of help.
    
    3. The family is the least inclusive. The village includes several families and is therefore more inclusive than the family.
  - |-
    The state is the most inclusive of all, for it comes into existence  
    "when several villages are united in a single complete com-  
    munity."
    
    4. Aristotle says the state originates in "the bare needs of  
    life," but that it continues in existence "for the sake of a good  
    life." A "good life" seems to be different in kind from mere  
    "life." In fact, this seems to be the main difference between  
    the state and the other two types of human association.
    
    5. Though the types of association are indeed natural, they  
    are not natural in the same way. Aristotle observes that many  
    animals as well as men live in families; and he notes that such  
    animals as bees seem to have organizations that are analogous  
    to the village. But man differs in that, while being social like  
    many other animals, he is also political. In his discussion of  
    man's unique possession of speech, Aristotle is saying that man  
    alone is political. He is naturally a political animal, and so the  
    state, which serves the needs of this aspect of his being, is  
    natural, But only the state, among the types of association that  
    he experiences, serves this particular need.
    
    6. Apparently Aristotle would not praise highly the man  
    who first founded the village or the family, as he does the man  
    who first founded the state. And this remark causes a difficulty,  
    for if the state was first founded by someone, then it can be  
    said to have been invented, and if it was invented, then is it  
    not artificial? But we have concluded that it is natural.
    
    7. The main problem Rousseau poses about the state is  
    its legitimacy. If the state were not legitimate, Rousseau as-  
    serts, then its laws would not have to be obeyed.
    
    8. He does not pose the same problem about the family.  
    He clearly says that the basis of the family is a natural need—  
    the same natural need that Aristotle describes.
    
    9. The conventional. For Rousseau, the state is conven-  
    tional; for if the state were like the family, that fact would  
    legitimize paternal rule—the rule of a benevolent despot, which  
    is what the father is to his family. Force—which is what the  
    father has—cannot make a state legitimate. Only an agreed-  
    upon understanding—a convention—can do that.
  - |-
    10. The Social Contract is, for Rousseau, the founding convention, undertaken at a first moment when all members of the state are unanimous in desiring and choosing it. It is this that legitimizes the institution of the state.
    
    Trst H (p. 412)
    
    1. Yes! He clearly says that men by nature need the state, for the state comes into existence at a time when life in the condition of nature is no longer possible for men, and without the state they could no longer continue to exist. Therefore, we must conclude that, in the view of Rousseau, the state is both natural and conventional. It is natural in the sense that it serves a natural need; but it is legitimate only if it is based on a founding convention—the Social Contract.
    
    2. Yes, Aristotle and Rousseau agree that the state is both natural and conventional.
    
    3. Aristotle and Rousseau also agree that the naturalness of the state is not like that of animal societies. Its naturalness arises from need or necessity; it achieves a good that cannot be achieved without it. But though the state is natural—that is, necessary—as a means to a naturally sought end, it is also a work of reason and will. The key word to define or identify this further agreement between the two writers is "constitution." For Aristotle, he who first "constituted" a society "founded" a state. For Rousseau, men by entering into a convention of government or social contract "constitute" a state.
    
    4. No, the "good" the state achieves is not the same for Rousseau as for Aristotle. The reasons are complex, and are not really documented in the passages reprinted here. But Aristotle's conception of the "good life," which is the end that the state serves, is different from Rousseau's conception of the "life of the citizen," which for him is the end that the state serves. Fully to understand this difference would require reading further in the Politics and The Social Contract.
    
    5. Clearly the two works are not in full agreement throughout. Even in these short selections, each of the authors raises points that the other does not discuss. For example,
  - |-
    There is no mention in the Rousseau text of a notion that is certainly important to Aristotle—namely, that man is essentially a political, as well as a social, animal. Nor does the word "justice" appear in the Rousseau text, although it seems to be a key term for Aristotle. On the other hand, there is no mention in the Aristotle text of such key terms and basic ideas as the social compact, the liberty of the individual, the alienation of that liberty, the general will, and so forth, all of which seem to be central in Rousseau's treatment of the subject.
