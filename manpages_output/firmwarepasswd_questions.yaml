The\n     firmwarepasswd command requires root privileges to run.\n\n     A list of flags and their descriptions:\n\n     -setpasswd\n\t     Prompts to add a new firmware password or change and existing\n\t     password if one exists.\n\n     -setmode mode [-allow-oroms]\n\t     Set the mode to \"command\" or \"full\".  \"Command\" will prompt for\n\t     the firmware password if the user attempts to boot from a\n\t     different volume.\t\"Full\" will prompt on every startup (not\n\t     recommended).  Optional \"allow-oroms\" flag will permit option\n\t     roms execution, that is denied by default once firmware password\n\t     is set."
