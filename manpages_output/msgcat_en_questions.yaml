    NAME
           doctools::msgcat::toc::en - Message catalog for the doctoc parser (EN)

    DESCRIPTION
           The package doctools::msgcat::toc::en is a support module providing the
           EN (english) language message catalog for the doctoc parser in the
           doctools system version 2. As such it is an internal package a regular
           user (developer) should not be in direct contact with.

           If you are such please go the documentation of either

           [1]    doctools::doc,

           [2]    doctools::toc, or

           [3]    doctools::idx

           Within the system architecture this package resides under the package
           doctools::msgcat providing the general message catalog management
           within the system. Note that there is no explicit dependency between
           the manager and catalog packages. The catalog is a plugin which is
           selected and loaded dynamically.

    API
           This package has no exported API.
