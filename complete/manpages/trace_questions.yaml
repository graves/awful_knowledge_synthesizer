By default, they include a selection of\n     kdebug trace events, Unified Logging information, and metadata to support\n     analysis, like symbols and machine configuration.\n\n     The record subcommand creates these files from the current system,\n     according to a plan and options passed in on the command line.  The\n     file-name positional argument is used as a prefix and can include path\n     components.  The path to the file is derived by adding an incrementing\n     number at the end, followed by the file extension.  To write to a\n     particular file path, end the argument with ‘.atrc’.  The default plan\n     produces files readable by Instruments System Trace and spindump(1)."
