Currently that is only the include path to the\n\t      curl include files.\n\n       --checkfor [version]\n\t      Specify the oldest possible libcurl version string you want, and\n\t      this script returns 0 if the current installation is new enough\n\t      or it returns 1 and outputs a text saying that the current\n\t      version is not new enough. (Added in 7.15.4)\n\n       --configure\n\t      Displays the arguments given to configure when building curl.\n\n       --feature\n\t      Lists what particular main features the installed libcurl was\n\t      built with. At the time of writing, this list may include SSL,\n\t      KRB4 or IPv6. Do not assume any particular order. The keywords\n\t      are separated by newlines. There may be none, one, or several\n\t      keywords in the list."
