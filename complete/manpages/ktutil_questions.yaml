Options that are not specified will\n\t\t be prompted for. This requires that you know the password or\n\t\t the hex key of the principal to add; if what you really want\n\t\t is to add a new principal to the keytab, you should consider\n\t\t the get command, which talks to the kadmin server.  --pw-file\n\t\t can specify either a file with a password, or the string\n\t\t STDIN.  In the latter case the password is read from stdin."

  manpageQuestion2: How can you use ktutil to add a new key to a keytab with verbose output and specify the principal as 'HTTP/hostname@REALM'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using ktutil to add a key to a keytab with a specified enctype of 'AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96' and a password from a file?
