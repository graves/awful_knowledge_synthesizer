In this introductory section,\n       `option' always has the meaning of an option to a command that should\n       be familiar to most command line users.\n\n       Typically, options are single letters preceded by a hyphen (-).\n       Options that take an argument accept it either immediately following\n       the option letter or after white space, for example `print -C3 {1..9}'\n       or `print -C 3 {1..9}' are equivalent.  Arguments to options are not\n       the same as arguments to the command; the documentation indicates which\n       is which.  Options that do not take an argument may be combined in a\n       single word, for example `print -rca -- *' and `print -r -c -a -- *'\n       are equivalent."

This indicates that the following words are\n       non-option arguments, but is otherwise ignored.\tThis is useful in\n       cases where arguments to the command may begin with `-'.  For\n       historical reasons, most builtin commands (including `echo') also\n       recognize a single `-' in a separate word for this purpose; note that\n       this is less standard and use of `--' is recommended.\n\n       - simple command\n\t      See the section `Precommand Modifiers' in zshmisc(1)."

In addition to setting shell options,\n\t      the command also restores the pristine state of pattern enables,\n\t      as if all patterns had been enabled using enable -p.\n\n\t      If the emulate command occurs inside a function that has been\n\t      marked for execution tracing with functions -t then the xtrace\n\t      option will be turned on regardless of emulation mode or other\n\t      options.\tNote that code executed inside the function by the .,\n\t      source, or eval commands is not considered to be running\n\t      directly from the function, hence does not provoke this\n\t      behaviour.\n\n\t      If the -R switch is given, all settable options are reset to\n\t      their default value corresponding to the specified emulation\n\t      mode, except for certain options describing the interactive\n\t      environment; otherwise, only those options likely to cause\n\t      portability problems in scripts and functions are altered.  If\n\t      the -L switch is given, the options LOCAL_OPTIONS,\n\t      LOCAL_PATTERNS and LOCAL_TRAPS will be set as well, causing the\n\t      effects of the emulate command and any setopt, disable -p or\n\t      enable -p, and trap commands to be local to the immediately\n\t      surrounding shell function, if any; normally these options are\n\t      turned off in all emulation modes except ksh. The -L switch is\n\t      mutually exclusive with the use of -c in flags.\n\n\t      If there is a single argument and the -l switch is given, the\n\t      options that would be set or unset (the latter indicated with\n\t      the prefix `no') are listed.  -l can be combined with -L or -R\n\t      and the list will be modified in the appropriate way.  Note the\n\t      list does not depend on the current setting of options, i.e. it\n\t      includes all options that may in principle change, not just\n\t      those that would actually change.\n\n\t      The flags may be any of the invocation-time flags described in\n\t      the section INVOCATION in zsh(1), except that `-o EMACS' and `-o\n\t      VI' may not be used.  Flags such as `+r'/`+o RESTRICTED' may be\n\t      prohibited in some circumstances.\n\n\t      If -c arg appears in flags, arg is evaluated while the requested\n\t      emulation is temporarily in effect.  In this case the emulation\n\t      mode and all options are restored to their previous values\n\t      before emulate returns.  The -R switch may precede the name of\n\t      the shell to emulate; note this has a meaning distinct from\n\t      including -R in flags.\n\n\t      Use of -c enables `sticky' emulation mode for functions defined\n\t      within the evaluated expression:\tthe emulation mode is\n\t      associated thereafter with the function so that whenever the\n\t      function is executed the emulation (respecting the -R switch, if\n\t      present) and all options are set (and pattern disables cleared)\n\t      before entry to the function, and the state is restored after\n\t      exit.  If the function is called when the sticky emulation is\n\t      already in effect, either within an `emulate shell -c'\n\t      expression or within another function with the same sticky\n\t      emulation, entry and exit from the function do not cause options\n\t      to be altered (except due to standard processing such as the\n\t      LOCAL_OPTIONS option).  This also applies to functions marked\n\t      for autoload within the sticky emulation; the appropriate set of\n\t      options will be applied at the point the function is loaded as\n\t      well as when it is run.\n\n\t      For example:\n\n\t\t     emulate sh -c 'fni() { setopt cshnullglob; }\n\t\t     fno() { fni; }'\n\t\t     fno\n\n\t      The two functions fni and fno are defined with sticky sh\n\t      emulation.  fno is then executed, causing options associated\n\t      with emulations to be set to their values in sh.\tfno then calls\n\t      fni; because fni is also marked for sticky sh emulation, no\n\t      option changes take place on entry to or exit from it.  Hence\n\t      the option cshnullglob, turned off by sh emulation, will be\n\t      turned on within fni and remain on return to fno.  On exit from\n\t      fno, the emulation mode and all options will be restored to the\n\t      state they were in before entry to the temporary emulation.\n\n\t      The documentation above is typically sufficient for the intended\n\t      purpose of executing code designed for other shells in a\n\t      suitable environment.  More detailed rules follow.\n\t      1.     The sticky emulation environment provided by `emulate\n\t\t     shell -c' is identical to that provided by entry to a\n\t\t     function marked for sticky emulation as a consequence of\n\t\t     being defined in such an environment.  Hence, for\n\t\t     example, the sticky emulation is inherited by\n\t\t     subfunctions defined within functions with sticky\n\t\t     emulation.\n\t      2.     No change of options takes place on entry to or exit from\n\t\t     functions that are not marked for sticky emulation, other\n\t\t     than those that would normally take place, even if those\n\t\t     functions are called within sticky emulation.\n\t      3.     No special handling is provided for functions marked for\n\t\t     autoload nor for functions present in wordcode created by\n\t\t     the zcompile command.\n\t      4.     The presence or absence of the -R switch to emulate\n\t\t     corresponds to different sticky emulation modes, so for\n\t\t     example `emulate sh -c', `emulate -R sh -c' and `emulate\n\t\t     csh -c' are treated as three distinct sticky emulations.\n\t      5.     Difference in shell options supplied in addition to the\n\t\t     basic emulation also mean the sticky emulations are\n\t\t     different, so for example `emulate zsh -c' and `emulate\n\t\t     zsh -o cbases -c' are treated as distinct sticky\n\t\t     emulations.\n\n       enable [ -afmprs ] name ...\n\t      Enable the named hash table elements, presumably disabled\n\t      earlier with disable.  The default is to enable builtin\n\t      commands.  The -a option causes enable to act on regular or\n\t      global aliases.  The -s option causes enable to act on suffix\n\t      aliases.\tThe -f option causes enable to act on shell functions.\n\t      The -r option causes enable to act on reserved words.  Without\n\t      arguments all enabled hash table elements from the corresponding\n\t      hash table are printed.  With the -m flag the arguments are\n\t      taken as patterns (should be quoted) and all hash table elements\n\t      from the corresponding hash table matching these patterns are\n\t      enabled.\tEnabled objects can be disabled with the disable\n\t      builtin command.\n\n\t      enable -p reenables patterns disabled with disable -p.  Note\n\t      that it does not override globbing options; for example, `enable\n\t      -p \"~\"' does not cause the pattern character ~ to be active\n\t      unless the EXTENDED_GLOB option is also set.  To enable all\n\t      possible patterns (so that they may be individually disabled\n\t      with disable -p), use `setopt EXTENDED_GLOB KSH_GLOB\n\t      NO_SH_GLOB'.\n\n       eval [ arg ... ]\n\t      Read the arguments as input to the shell and execute the\n\t      resulting command(s) in the current shell process.  The return\n\t      status is the same as if the commands had been executed directly\n\t      by the shell; if there are no args or they contain no commands\n\t      (i.e. are an empty string or whitespace) the return status is\n\t      zero.\n\n       exec [ -cl ] [ -a argv0 ] [ command [ arg ... ] ]\n\t      Replace the current shell with command rather than forking.

This\n\t      means further precommand modifiers such as builtin and noglob\n\t      are also not interpreted within the shell.  Hence command is\n\t      always found by searching the command path.\n\n\t      If command is omitted but any redirections are specified, then\n\t      the redirections will take effect in the current shell.\n\n       exit [ n ]\n\t      Exit the shell with the exit status specified by an arithmetic\n\t      expression n; if none is specified, use the exit status from the\n\t      last command executed.  An EOF condition will also cause the\n\t      shell to exit, unless the IGNORE_EOF option is set.\n\n\t      See notes at the end of the section JOBS in zshmisc(1) for some\n\t      possibly unexpected interactions of the exit command with jobs.\n\n       export [ name[=value] ... ]\n\t      The specified names are marked for automatic export to the\n\t      environment of subsequently executed commands.

With no flags or with the flag `-', the arguments are\n\t      printed on the standard output as described by echo, with the\n\t      following differences: the escape sequence `\\M-x' (or `\\Mx')\n\t      metafies the character x (sets the highest bit), `\\C-x' (or\n\t      `\\Cx') produces a control character (`\\C-@' and `\\C-?' give the\n\t      characters NULL and delete), a character code in octal is\n\t      represented by `\\NNN' (instead of `\\0NNN'), and `\\E' is a\n\t      synonym for `\\e'.  Finally, if not in an escape sequence, `\\'\n\t      escapes the following character and is not printed.\n\n\t      -a     Print arguments with the column incrementing first.  Only\n\t\t     useful with the -c and -C options.\n\n\t      -b     Recognize all the escape sequences defined for the\n\t\t     bindkey command, see the section `Zle Builtins' in\n\t\t     zshzle(1).\n\n\t      -c     Print the arguments in columns.  Unless -a is also given,\n\t\t     arguments are printed with the row incrementing first.\n\n\t      -C cols\n\t\t     Print the arguments in cols columns.  Unless -a is also\n\t\t     given, arguments are printed with the row incrementing\n\t\t     first.\n\n\t      -D     Treat the arguments as paths, replacing directory\n\t\t     prefixes with ~ expressions corresponding to directory\n\t\t     names, as appropriate.\n\n\t      -i     If given together with -o or -O, sorting is performed\n\t\t     case-independently.\n\n\t      -l     Print the arguments separated by newlines instead of\n\t\t     spaces.  Note: if the list of arguments is empty, print\n\t\t     -l will still output one empty line. To print a\n\t\t     possibly-empty list of arguments one per line, use print\n\t\t     -C1, as in `print -rC1 -- \"$list[@]\"'.\n\n\t      -m     Take the first argument as a pattern (should be quoted),\n\t\t     and remove it from the argument list together with\n\t\t     subsequent arguments that do not match this pattern.\n\n\t      -n     Do not add a newline to the output.\n\n\t      -N     Print the arguments separated and terminated by nulls.\n\t\t     Again, print -rNC1 -- \"$list[@]\" is a canonical way to\n\t\t     print an arbitrary list as null-delimited records.\n\n\t      -o     Print the arguments sorted in ascending order.\n\n\t      -O     Print the arguments sorted in descending order.\n\n\t      -p     Print the arguments to the input of the coprocess.\n\n\t      -P     Perform prompt expansion (see EXPANSION OF PROMPT\n\t\t     SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1)).\tIn combination with `-f',\n\t\t     prompt escape sequences are parsed only within\n\t\t     interpolated arguments, not within the format string.\n\n\t      -r     Ignore the escape conventions of echo.\n\n\t      -R     Emulate the BSD echo command, which does not process\n\t\t     escape sequences unless the -e flag is given.  The -n\n\t\t     flag suppresses the trailing newline.  Only the -e and -n\n\t\t     flags are recognized after -R; all other arguments and\n\t\t     options are printed.\n\n\t      -s     Place the results in the history list instead of on the\n\t\t     standard output.  Each argument to the print command is\n\t\t     treated as a single word in the history, regardless of\n\t\t     its content.\n\n\t      -S     Place the results in the history list instead of on the\n\t\t     standard output.  In this case only a single argument is\n\t\t     allowed; it will be split into words as if it were a full\n\t\t     shell command line.  The effect is similar to reading the\n\t\t     line from a history file with the HIST_LEX_WORDS option\n\t\t     active.\n\n\t      -u n   Print the arguments to file descriptor n.\n\n\t      -v name\n\t\t     Store the printed arguments as the value of the parameter\n\t\t     name.\n\n\t      -x tab-stop\n\t\t     Expand leading tabs on each line of output in the printed\n\t\t     string assuming a tab stop every tab-stop characters.\n\t\t     This is appropriate for formatting code that may be\n\t\t     indented with tabs.  Note that leading tabs of any\n\t\t     argument to print, not just the first, are expanded, even\n\t\t     if print is using spaces to separate arguments (the\n\t\t     column count is maintained across arguments but may be\n\t\t     incorrect on output owing to previous unexpanded tabs).\n\n\t\t     The start of the output of each print command is assumed\n\t\t     to be aligned with a tab stop.  Widths of multibyte\n\t\t     characters are handled if the option MULTIBYTE is in\n\t\t     effect.  This option is ignored if other formatting\n\t\t     options are in effect, namely column alignment or printf\n\t\t     style, or if output is to a special location such as\n\t\t     shell history or the command line editor.\n\n\t      -X tab-stop\n\t\t     This is similar to -x, except that all tabs in the\n\t\t     printed string are expanded.  This is appropriate if tabs\n\t\t     in the arguments are being used to produce a table\n\t\t     format.\n\n\t      -z     Push the arguments onto the editing buffer stack,\n\t\t     separated by spaces.\n\n\t      If any of `-m', `-o' or `-O' are used in combination with `-f'\n\t      and there are no arguments (after the removal process in the\n\t      case of `-m') then nothing is printed.\n\n       printf [ -v name ] format [ arg ... ]\n\t      Print the arguments according to the format specification.\n\t      Formatting rules are the same as used in C. The same escape\n\t      sequences as for echo are recognised in the format. All C\n\t      conversion specifications ending in one of csdiouxXeEfgGn are\n\t      handled. In addition to this, `%b' can be used instead of `%s'\n\t      to cause escape sequences in the argument to be recognised and\n\t      `%q' can be used to quote the argument in such a way that allows\n\t      it to be reused as shell input. With the numeric format\n\t      specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a quote\n\t      character, the numeric value of the following character is used\n\t      as the number to print; otherwise the argument is evaluated as\n\t      an arithmetic expression. See the section `Arithmetic\n\t      Evaluation' in zshmisc(1) for a description of arithmetic\n\t      expressions. With `%n', the corresponding argument is taken as\n\t      an identifier which is created as an integer parameter.\n\n\t      Normally, conversion specifications are applied to each argument\n\t      in order but they can explicitly specify the nth argument is to\n\t      be used by replacing `%' by `%n$' and `*' by `*n$'.  It is\n\t      recommended that you do not mix references of this explicit\n\t      style with the normal style and the handling of such mixed\n\t      styles may be subject to future change.\n\n\t      If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format string\n\t      is reused until all arguments have been consumed. With the print\n\t      builtin, this can be suppressed by using the -r option. If more\n\t      arguments are required by the format than have been specified,\n\t      the behaviour is as if zero or an empty string had been\n\t      specified as the argument.\n\n\t      The -v option causes the output to be stored as the value of the\n\t      parameter name, instead of printed. If name is an array and the\n\t      format string is reused when consuming arguments then one array\n\t      element will be used for each use of the format string.\n\n       pushd [ -qsLP ] [ arg ]\n       pushd [ -qsLP ] old new\n       pushd [ -qsLP ] {+|-}n\n\t      Change the current directory, and push the old current directory\n\t      onto the directory stack.  In the first form, change the current\n\t      directory to arg.  If arg is not specified, change to the second\n\t      directory on the stack (that is, exchange the top two entries),\n\t      or change to $HOME if the PUSHD_TO_HOME option is set or if\n\t      there is only one entry on the stack.  Otherwise, arg is\n\t      interpreted as it would be by cd.  The meaning of old and new in\n\t      the second form is also the same as for cd.\n\n\t      The third form of pushd changes directory by rotating the\n\t      directory list.  An argument of the form `+n' identifies a stack\n\t      entry by counting from the left of the list shown by the dirs\n\t      command, starting with zero.  An argument of the form `-n'\n\t      counts from the right.  If the PUSHD_MINUS option is set, the\n\t      meanings of `+' and `-' in this context are swapped.\n\n\t      If the -q (quiet) option is specified, the hook function chpwd\n\t      and the functions in the array $chpwd_functions are not called,\n\t      and the new directory stack is not printed.  This is useful for\n\t      calls to pushd that do not change the environment seen by an\n\t      interactive user.\n\n\t      If the option -q is not specified and the shell option\n\t      PUSHD_SILENT is not set, the directory stack will be printed\n\t      after a pushd is performed.\n\n\t      The options -s, -L and -P have the same meanings as for the cd\n\t      builtin.\n\n       pushln [ arg ... ]\n\t      Equivalent to print -nz.\n\n       pwd [ -rLP ]\n\t      Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory.\n\t      If the -r or the -P flag is specified, or the CHASE_LINKS option\n\t      is set and the -L flag is not given, the printed path will not\n\t      contain symbolic links.\n\n       r      Same as fc -e -."

With +s sort arguments in descending\n\t      order.  For the meaning of the other flags, see zshoptions(1).\n\t      Flags may be specified by name using the -o option. If no option\n\t      name is supplied with -o, the current option states are printed:\n\t      see the description of setopt below for more information on the\n\t      format.  With +o they are printed in a form that can be used as\n\t      input to the shell.\n\n\t      If the -A flag is specified, name is set to an array containing\n\t      the given args; if no name is specified, all arrays are printed\n\t      together with their values.\n\n\t      If +A is used and name is an array, the given arguments will\n\t      replace the initial elements of that array; if no name is\n\t      specified, all arrays are printed without their values.\n\n\t      The behaviour of arguments after -A name or +A name depends on\n\t      whether the option KSH_ARRAYS is set.  If it is not set, all\n\t      arguments following name are treated as values for the array,\n\t      regardless of their form.  If the option is set, normal option\n\t      processing continues at that point; only regular arguments are\n\t      treated as values for the array.\tThis means that\n\n\t\t     set -A array -x -- foo\n\n\t      sets array to `-x -- foo' if KSH_ARRAYS is not set, but sets the\n\t      array to foo and turns on the option `-x' if it is set.\n\n\t      If the -A flag is not present, but there are arguments beyond\n\t      the options, the positional parameters are set.  If the option\n\t      list (if any) is terminated by `--', and there are no further\n\t      arguments, the positional parameters will be unset.\n\n\t      If no arguments and no `--' are given, then the names and values\n\t      of all parameters are printed on the standard output.

All options specified either\n\t      with flags or by name are set.\n\n\t      If no arguments are supplied, the names of all options currently\n\t      set are printed.\tThe form is chosen so as to minimize the\n\t      differences from the default options for the current emulation\n\t      (the default emulation being native zsh, shown as <Z> in\n\t      zshoptions(1)).  Options that are on by default for the\n\t      emulation are shown with the prefix no only if they are off,\n\t      while other options are shown without the prefix no and only if\n\t      they are on.  In addition to options changed from the default\n\t      state by the user, any options activated automatically by the\n\t      shell (for example, SHIN_STDIN or INTERACTIVE) will be shown in\n\t      the list.  The format is further modified by the option\n\t      KSH_OPTION_PRINT, however the rationale for choosing options\n\t      with or without the no prefix remains the same in this case.\n\n\t      If the -m flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns\n\t      (which should be quoted to protect them from filename\n\t      expansion), and all options with names matching these patterns\n\t      are set.\n\n\t      Note that a bad option name does not cause execution of\n\t      subsequent shell code to be aborted; this is behaviour is\n\t      different from that of `set -o'.\tThis is because set is\n\t      regarded as a special builtin by the POSIX standard, but setopt\n\t      is not.\n\n       shift [ -p ] [ n ] [ name ... ]\n\t      The positional parameters ${n+1} ... are renamed to $1 ...,\n\t      where n is an arithmetic expression that defaults to 1.  If any\n\t      names are given then the arrays with these names are shifted\n\t      instead of the positional parameters.\n\n\t      If the option -p is given arguments are instead removed (popped)\n\t      from the end rather than the start of the array.\n\n       source file [ arg ... ]\n\t      Same as `.', except that the current directory is always\n\t      searched and is always searched first, before directories in\n\t      $path.\n\n       stat   See the section `The zsh/stat Module' in zshmodules(1).\n\n       suspend [ -f ]\n\t      Suspend the execution of the shell (send it a SIGTSTP) until it\n\t      receives a SIGCONT.

The main differences between the conditional\n\t      expression syntax and the test and [ builtins are:  these\n\t      commands are not handled syntactically, so for example an empty\n\t      variable expansion may cause an argument to be omitted; syntax\n\t      errors cause status 2 to be returned instead of a shell error;\n\t      and arithmetic operators expect integer arguments rather than\n\t      arithmetic expressions.\n\n\t      The command attempts to implement POSIX and its extensions where\n\t      these are specified.  Unfortunately there are intrinsic\n\t      ambiguities in the syntax; in particular there is no distinction\n\t      between test operators and strings that resemble them.  The\n\t      standard attempts to resolve these for small numbers of\n\t      arguments (up to four); for five or more arguments compatibility\n\t      cannot be relied on.  Users are urged wherever possible to use\n\t      the `[[' test syntax which does not have these ambiguities.\n\n       times  Print the accumulated user and system times for the shell and\n\t      for processes run from the shell.\n\n       trap [ arg ] [ sig ... ]\n\t      arg is a series of commands (usually quoted to protect it from\n\t      immediate evaluation by the shell) to be read and executed when\n\t      the shell receives any of the signals specified by one or more\n\t      sig args.  Each sig can be given as a number, or as the name of\n\t      a signal either with or without the string SIG in front (e.g. 1,\n\t      HUP, and SIGHUP are all the same signal).\n\n\t      If arg is `-', then the specified signals are reset to their\n\t      defaults, or, if no sig args are present, all traps are reset.\n\n\t      If arg is an empty string, then the specified signals are\n\t      ignored by the shell (and by the commands it invokes).\n\n\t      If arg is omitted but one or more sig args are provided (i.e.\n\t      the first argument is a valid signal number or name), the effect\n\t      is the same as if arg had been specified as `-'.\n\n\t      The trap command with no arguments prints a list of commands\n\t      associated with each signal.\n\n\t      If sig is ZERR then arg will be executed after each command with\n\t      a nonzero exit status.  ERR is an alias for ZERR on systems that\n\t      have no SIGERR signal (this is the usual case).\n\n\t      If sig is DEBUG then arg will be executed before each command if\n\t      the option DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD is set (as it is by default), else\n\t      after each command.  Here, a `command' is what is described as a\n\t      `sublist' in the shell grammar, see the section SIMPLE COMMANDS\n\t      & PIPELINES in zshmisc(1).  If DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD is set various\n\t      additional features are available.  First, it is possible to\n\t      skip the next command by setting the option ERR_EXIT; see the\n\t      description of the ERR_EXIT option in zshoptions(1).  Also, the\n\t      shell parameter ZSH_DEBUG_CMD is set to the string corresponding\n\t      to the command to be executed following the trap.  Note that\n\t      this string is reconstructed from the internal format and may\n\t      not be formatted the same way as the original text.  The\n\t      parameter is unset after the trap is executed.\n\n\t      If sig is 0 or EXIT and the trap statement is executed inside\n\t      the body of a function, then the command arg is executed after\n\t      the function completes.  The value of $? at the start of\n\t      execution is the exit status of the shell or the return status\n\t      of the function exiting.\tIf sig is 0 or EXIT and the trap\n\t      statement is not executed inside the body of a function, then\n\t      the command arg is executed when the shell terminates; the trap\n\t      runs before any zshexit hook functions.\n\n\t      ZERR, DEBUG, and EXIT traps are not executed inside other traps.\n\t      ZERR and DEBUG traps are kept within subshells, while other\n\t      traps are reset.\n\n\t      Note that traps defined with the trap builtin are slightly\n\t      different from those defined as `TRAPNAL () { ... }', as the\n\t      latter have their own function environment (line numbers, local\n\t      variables, etc.) while the former use the environment of the\n\t      command in which they were called.  For example,\n\n\t\t     trap 'print $LINENO' DEBUG\n\n\t      will print the line number of a command executed after it has\n\t      run, while\n\n\t\t     TRAPDEBUG() { print $LINENO; }\n\n\t      will always print the number zero.\n\n\t      Alternative signal names are allowed as described under kill\n\t      above.  Defining a trap under either name causes any trap under\n\t      an alternative name to be removed.  However, it is recommended\n\t      that for consistency users stick exclusively to one name or\n\t      another.\n\n       true [ arg ... ]\n\t      Do nothing and return an exit status of 0.\n\n       ttyctl [ -fu ]\n\t      The -f option freezes the tty (i.e. terminal or terminal\n\t      emulator), and -u unfreezes it.  When the tty is frozen, no\n\t      changes made to the tty settings by external programs will be\n\t      honored by the shell, except for changes in the size of the\n\t      screen; the shell will simply reset the settings to their\n\t      previous values as soon as each command exits or is suspended.\n\t      Thus, stty and similar programs have no effect when the tty is\n\t      frozen.  Freezing the tty does not cause the current state to be\n\t      remembered: instead, it causes future changes to the state to be\n\t      blocked.\n\n\t      Without options it reports whether the terminal is frozen or\n\t      not.\n\n\t      Note that, regardless of whether the tty is frozen or not, the\n\t      shell needs to change the settings when the line editor starts,\n\t      so unfreezing the tty does not guarantee settings made on the\n\t      command line are preserved.  Strings of commands run between\n\t      editing the command line will see a consistent tty state.  See\n\t      also the shell variable STTY for a means of initialising the tty\n\t      before running external commands and/or freezing the tty around\n\t      a single command.\n\n       type [ -wfpamsS ] name ...\n\t      Equivalent to whence -v."

When inside a function, a new parameter\n\t      is created for every name (even those that already exist), and\n\t      is unset again when the function completes.  See `Local\n\t      Parameters' in zshparam(1).  The same rules apply to special\n\t      shell parameters, which retain their special attributes when\n\t      made local.\n\n\t      For each name=value assignment, the parameter name is set to\n\t      value.  If the assignment is omitted and name does not refer to\n\t      an existing parameter, a new parameter is intialized to empty\n\t      string, zero, or empty array (as appropriate), unless the shell\n\t      option TYPESET_TO_UNSET is set.  When that option is set, the\n\t      parameter attributes are recorded but the parameter remains\n\t      unset.\n\n\t      If the shell option TYPESET_SILENT is not set, for each\n\t      remaining name that refers to a parameter that is already set,\n\t      the name and value of the parameter are printed in the form of\n\t      an assignment.  Nothing is printed for newly-created parameters,\n\t      or when any attribute flags listed below are given along with\n\t      the name.  Using `+' instead of minus to introduce an attribute\n\t      turns it off.\n\n\t      If no name is present, the names and values of all parameters\n\t      are printed.  In this case the attribute flags restrict the\n\t      display to only those parameters that have the specified\n\t      attributes, and using `+' rather than `-' to introduce the flag\n\t      suppresses printing of the values of parameters when there is no\n\t      parameter name.\n\n\t      All forms of the command handle scalar assignment.  Array\n\t      assignment is possible if any of the reserved words declare,\n\t      export, float, integer, local, readonly or typeset is matched\n\t      when the line is parsed (N.B. not when it is executed).  In this\n\t      case the arguments are parsed as assignments, except that the\n\t      `+=' syntax and the GLOB_ASSIGN option are not supported, and\n\t      scalar values after = are not split further into words, even if\n\t      expanded (regardless of the setting of the KSH_TYPESET option;\n\t      this option is obsolete).\n\n\t      Examples of the differences between command and reserved word\n\t      parsing:\n\n\t\t     # Reserved word parsing\n\t\t     typeset svar=$(echo one word) avar=(several words)\n\n\t      The above creates a scalar parameter svar and an array parameter\n\t      avar as if the assignments had been\n\n\t\t     svar=\"one word\"\n\t\t     avar=(several words)\n\n\t      On the other hand:\n\n\t\t     # Normal builtin interface\n\t\t     builtin typeset svar=$(echo two words)\n\n\t      The builtin keyword causes the above to use the standard builtin\n\t      interface to typeset in which argument parsing is performed in\n\t      the same way as for other commands.  This example creates a\n\t      scalar svar containing the value two and another scalar\n\t      parameter words with no value.  An array value in this case\n\t      would either cause an error or be treated as an obscure set of\n\t      glob qualifiers.\n\n\t      Arbitrary arguments are allowed if they take the form of\n\t      assignments after command line expansion; however, these only\n\t      perform scalar assignment:\n\n\t\t     var='svar=val'\n\t\t     typeset $var\n\n\t      The above sets the scalar parameter svar to the value val.\n\t      Parentheses around the value within var would not cause array\n\t      assignment as they will be treated as ordinary characters when\n\t      $var is substituted.  Any non-trivial expansion in the name part\n\t      of the assignment causes the argument to be treated in this\n\t      fashion:\n\n\t\t     typeset {var1,var2,var3}=name\n\n\t      The above syntax is valid, and has the expected effect of\n\t      setting the three parameters to the same value, but the command\n\t      line is parsed as a set of three normal command line arguments\n\t      to typeset after expansion.  Hence it is not possible to assign\n\t      to multiple arrays by this means.\n\n\t      Note that each interface to any of the commands may be disabled\n\t      separately.  For example, `disable -r typeset' disables the\n\t      reserved word interface to typeset, exposing the builtin\n\t      interface, while `disable typeset' disables the builtin.\tNote\n\t      that disabling the reserved word interface for typeset may cause\n\t      problems with the output of `typeset -p', which assumes the\n\t      reserved word interface is available in order to restore array\n\t      and associative array values.\n\n\t      Unlike parameter assignment statements, typeset's exit status on\n\t      an assignment that involves a command substitution does not\n\t      reflect the exit status of the command substitution.  Therefore,\n\t      to test for an error in a command substitution, separate the\n\t      declaration of the parameter from its initialization:\n\n\t\t     # WRONG\n\t\t     typeset var1=$(exit 1) || echo \"Trouble with var1\"\n\n\t\t     # RIGHT\n\t\t     typeset var1 && var1=$(exit 1) || echo \"Trouble with var1\""

If\n\t\t     only one argument is given, all dependencies for that\n\t\t     module are removed.\n\n\t      zmodload -ab [ -L ]\n\t      zmodload -ab [ -i ] name [ builtin ... ]\n\t      zmodload -ub [ -i ] builtin ...\n\t\t     The -ab option defines autoloaded builtins.  It defines\n\t\t     the specified builtins.  When any of those builtins is\n\t\t     called, the module specified in the first argument is\n\t\t     loaded and all its features are enabled (for selective\n\t\t     control of features use `zmodload -F -a' as described\n\t\t     above).  If only the name is given, one builtin is\n\t\t     defined, with the same name as the module.  -i suppresses\n\t\t     the error if the builtin is already defined or\n\t\t     autoloaded, but not if another builtin of the same name\n\t\t     is already defined."
