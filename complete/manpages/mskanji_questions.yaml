It encodes the\n     characters from the JIS X 0201 (ASCII/JIS-Roman) and JIS X 0208\n     (Japanese) character sets as sequences of either one or two bytes.\n\n     Characters from the ASCII/JIS-Roman character set are encoded as single\n     bytes between 0x00 and 0x7F (ASCII) or 0xA1 and 0xDF (Half-width\n     katakana).\n\n     Characters from the JIS X 0208 character set are encoded as two bytes.\n     The first ranges from 0x81 - 0x9F, 0xE0 - 0xEA, 0xED - 0xEE (not JIS:\n     NEC-selected IBM extended characters), 0xF0 - 0xF9 (not JIS: user\n     defined), or 0xFA - 0xFC (not JIS: IBM extended characters).  The second\n     byte ranges from 0x40 - 0xFC, excluding 0x7F (delete).\n\nSEE ALSO\n     euc(5), utf8(5)"
