The file(1) command identifies the type\n     of a file using, among other tests, a test for whether the file contains\n     certain “magic patterns”.\tThe database of these “magic patterns” is\n     usually located in a binary file in /usr/share/file/magic.mgc or a\n     directory of source text magic pattern fragment files in\n     /usr/share/file/magic.  The database specifies what patterns are to be\n     tested for, what message or MIME type to print if a particular pattern is\n     found, and additional information to extract from the file.\n\n     The format of the source fragment files that are used to build this\n     database is as follows: Each line of a fragment file specifies a test to\n     be performed.  A test compares the data starting at a particular offset\n     in the file with a byte value, a string or a numeric value.  If the test\n     succeeds, a message is printed.  The line consists of the following\n     fields:"

The number of > on the line indicates\n     the level of the test; a line with no > at the beginning is considered to\n     be at level 0.
