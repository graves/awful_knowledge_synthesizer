The first line displays the current\n     time of day, how long the system has been running, the number of users\n     logged into the system, and the load averages.  The load average numbers\n     give the number of jobs in the run queue averaged over 1, 5 and 15\n     minutes.\n\n     The fields output are the user's login name, the name of the terminal the\n     user is on, the host from which the user is logged in, the time the user\n     logged on, the time since the user last typed anything, and the name and\n     arguments of the current process.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     --libxo\n\t     Generate output via libxo(3) in a selection of different human\n\t     and machine readable formats.  See xo_parse_args(3) for details\n\t     on command line arguments."

The current algorithm is\n     “the highest numbered process on the terminal that is not ignoring\n     interrupts, or, if there is none, the highest numbered process on the\n     terminal”.  This fails, for example, in critical sections of programs\n     like the shell and editor, or when faulty programs running in the\n     background fork and fail to ignore interrupts.  (In cases where no\n     process can be found, w prints ‘-’.)"
