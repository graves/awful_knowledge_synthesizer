The end result is functionally similar to passing\n     -kernel to hdiutil(1)'s attach verb.  hdik does not rely upon the\n     presence of DiskImages or other high-level frameworks.\n\n     The DiskImages driver only supports a selection of disk image formats:\n     UDRW, UDRO, UDZO, ULFO, SPARSE (UDSP).  It also supports shadow files.\n     hdiutil(1)'s imageinfo verb indicates whether a particular image is\n     kernel compatible.\n\n     hdik requires root access to perform its functions.\n\n     In the first form, an image to attach must be provided:\n\n     imagefile\t path to the disk image file to attach.\n\n     In its second form, hdik issues an eject command to the specified device.\n     The argument is the full device node path (e.g.  /dev/disk2). Any volumes\n     mounted from the device must be unmounted first, or the command will\n     fail.  See umount(8)."
