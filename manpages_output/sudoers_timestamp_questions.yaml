Once a user has been authenticated, they may use sudo without\n       a password for a short period of time (5 minutes unless overridden by\n       the timestamp_timeout option) .\tBy default, sudoers uses a separate\n       record for each terminal, which means that a user's login sessions are\n       authenticated separately.  The timestamp_type option can be used to\n       select the type of time stamp record sudoers will use.\n\n       A multi-record time stamp file format was introduced in sudo 1.8.10\n       that uses a single file per user.  Previously, a separate file was used\n       for each user and terminal combination unless tty-based time stamps\n       were disabled.  The new format is extensible and records of multiple\n       types and versions may coexist within the same file."
