This command has to be invoked\n\t      first, before any other command of this package.\n\n\t      The command returns the channel handle of the opened file as its\n\t      result.\n\n       ::fileutil::magic::rt::close\n\t      This command closes the last file opened via\n\t      ::fileutil::magic::rt::open and shuts the runtime down.  This\n\t      command has to be invoked last, after the file has been dealt\n\t      with completely.\tAfterward another invokation of\n\t      ::fileutil::magic::rt::open  is required to process another\n\t      file.\n\n\t      This command returns the empty string as its result.\n\n       ::fileutil::magic::rt::file_start name\n\t      This command marks the start of a magic file when debugging. It\n\t      returns the empty string as its result.\n\n       ::fileutil::magic::rt::result ?msg?\n\t      This command returns the current result and stops processing.\n\n\t      If msg is specified its text is added to the result before it is\n\t      returned. See ::fileutil::magic::rt::emit for the allowed\n\t      special character sequences.\n\n       ::fileutil::magic::rt::resultv ?msg?\n\t      This command returns the current result.\tIn contrast to\n\t      ::fileutil::magic::rt::result processing continues.\n\n\t      If msg is specified its text is added to the result before it is\n\t      returned. See ::fileutil::magic::rt::emit for the allowed\n\t      special character sequences.\n\n       ::fileutil::magic::rt::emit msg\n\t      This command adds the text msg to the result buffer. The message\n\t      may contain the following special character sequences. They will\n\t      be replaced with buffered values before the message is added to\n\t      the result. The command returns the empty string as its result.\n\n\t      \\b     This sequence is removed\n\n\t      %s     Replaced with the last buffered string value.\n\n\t      %ld    Replaced with the last buffered numeric value.\n\n\t      %d     See above.\n\n       ::fileutil::magic::rt::Nv type offset ?qual?\n\t      This command fetches the numeric value with type from the\n\t      absolute location offset and returns it as its result. The\n\t      fetched value is further stored in the numeric buffer.\n\n\t      If qual is specified it is considered to be a mask and applied\n\t      to the fetched value before it is stored and returned. It has to\n\t      have the form of a partial Tcl bit-wise expression, i.e.\n\n\t\t   & number\n\n\t      For example:\n\n\t\t   Nv lelong 0 &0x8080ffff\n\n\t      For the possible types see section NUMERIC TYPES.\n\n       ::fileutil::magic::rt::N type offset comp val ?qual?\n\t      This command behaves mostly like ::fileutil::magic::rt::Nv,\n\t      except that it compares the fetched and masked value against val\n\t      as specified with comp and returns the result of that\n\t      comparison.\n\n\t      The argument comp has to contain one of Tcl's comparison\n\t      operators, and the comparison made will be\n\n\t\t   <val> <comp> <fetched-and-masked-value>"
