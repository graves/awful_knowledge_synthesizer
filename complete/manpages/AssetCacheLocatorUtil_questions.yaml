    Manpage text:

    AssetCacheLocatorUtil then reports the reachability status of all of the
         content caches it found.  If the computer cannot communicate with a
         content cache over the local network then it cannot request files from
         that content cache.  However, just because the computer can "ping" a
         content cache does not imply that that content cache will serve requests
         sent from this computer.

         The --json option prints the results in machine-parseable JSON format to
         stdout.

    WARNINGS
         AssetCacheLocatorUtil also reports warnings about potential issues it
         discovers.

         The Apple cloud service with which content caches register limits the
         number of content caches on a network.  This limit can change at any
         time.  If a larger number of content caches are available on a network
         than the cloud allows, client devices might not always choose the "best"
         content cache.  AssetCacheLocatorUtil warns when it detects this
         possibility.  The number of content caches available on a network can be
         reduced by changing the settings of some of the content caches, using
         System Settings > Sharing > Content Caching > press the option key >
         Advanced Options... > Clients > Cache content for:.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `AssetCacheLocatorUtil`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nAssetCacheLocatorUtil warns when it detects content caches with different\n     ranks.  The exact value and meaning of each rank is defined by the Apple\n     cloud service with which content caches register, and can change at any\n     time, but client devices use only the content caches with the lowest-\n     numbered rank available to them.  A content cache's rank can be changed\n     by adjusting its settings, using System Settings > Sharing > Content\n     Caching > press the option key > Advanced Options... > Clients > Cache\n     content for:.  A content cache on the same computer as the client always\n     has the lowest-numbered rank.\n\n     Having content caches in different ranks can be intentional or\n     accidental, depending on your organization.  AssetCacheLocatorUtil warns\n     about mixed ranks in case it is accidental.  An example of an intentional\n     use of mixed ranks is when a school has a content cache that caches\n     content for devices using the same local networks and the school's\n     district office has another content cache that caches content for devices\n     using the same public IP address.\tClient devices in the school use the\n     school's content cache.  Client devices in a different school in the same\n     district use the district's content cache."
