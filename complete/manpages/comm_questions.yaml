For\n     example, if column number two is being suppressed, lines printed in\n     column number one will not have any tabs preceding them, and lines\n     printed in column number three will have one."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the comm command?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the comm command to compare two sorted files and display only the lines that are common to both?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the comm command with the -i option to compare two files case-insensitively and show all three columns?

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the comm command to find common lines between two sorted files, while ignoring case differences?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the comm command to display lines that are present in the first file but not in the second, and common lines between two sorted files?
