Other problems,\n       such as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as\n       well. This option is intended only for debugging errors, and should not\n       be used under any other circumstances.\n\n     -P\n       Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities\n       overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a\n       window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see\n       command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the\n       memory containing the command-line arguments."

In order to\n     avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,\n     db_printlog should always be given the chance to detach from the\n     environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_printlog to release all\n     environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal\n     (SIGINT).\n\n     The db_printlog utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n     DB_HOME  If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable\n\t      DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as\n\t      described in DB_ENV->open."
