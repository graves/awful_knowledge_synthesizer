    NAME
           unicode::data - unicode data tables, generated, internal

    SYNOPSIS
           package require Tcl  8.3

           package require unicode::data  1.0.0

    ______________________________________________________________________________

    DESCRIPTION
           The unicode::data package is a helper for unicode, providing it with
           the data tables needed to perform its functions. It is an internal
           package which should not be accessed on its own. Because of that it has
           no publicly documented API either. Its implementation is generated by a
           script.

    BUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK
           This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain
           bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category stringprep
           of the Tcllib SF Trackers
           [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report
           any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or
           documentation.
