It\n       requires root privileges due to the kernel tracing facility it uses to\n       operate. By default dyld_usage monitors dyld activity in all processes\n       except the running dyld_usage process, Terminal, telnetd, sshd,\n       rlogind, tcsh, csh, and sh. These defaults can be overridden such that\n       output is limited to include or exclude a list of processes specified\n       on the command line.  Processes may be specified either by file name or\n       by process id.\n\n       The output of dyld_usage is formatted according to the size of your\n       window. A narrow window will display fewer columns of data. Use a wide\n       window for maximum data display."

Typically these\n\t\t operations are triggered by process launch or via a dlopen or\n\t\t dlsym system call. System call entries include both the\n\t\t parameters to the system call and the system call's return\n\t\t code (e.g., 0 on success).\n\n\t  TIME INTERVAL\n\t\t The elapsed time spent in the dynamic linker operation or\n\t\t system call.\n\n\t  PROCESS NAME\n\t\t The process that generated the dynamic linker activity. If\n\t\t space allows, the thread id will be appended to the process\n\t\t name (i.e., Mail.nnn)."
