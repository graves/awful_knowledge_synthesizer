The following forms are currently supported:\n\n       event add <<virtual>> sequence ?sequence ...?\n\t      Associates the virtual event virtual with the physical event\n\t      sequence(s) given by the sequence arguments, so that the virtual\n\t      event will trigger whenever any one of the sequences occurs.\n\t      Virtual may be any string value and sequence may have any of the\n\t      values allowed for the sequence argument to the bind command.\n\t      If virtual is already defined, the new physical event sequences\n\t      add to the existing sequences for the event.\n\n       event delete <<virtual>> ?sequence sequence ...?\n\t      Deletes each of the sequences from those associated with the\n\t      virtual event given by virtual.  Virtual may be any string value\n\t      and sequence may have any of the values allowed for the sequence\n\t      argument to the bind command.  Any sequences not currently\n\t      associated with virtual are ignored.  If no sequence argument is\n\t      provided, all physical event sequences are removed for virtual,\n\t      so that the virtual event will not trigger anymore.\n\n       event generate window event ?option value option value ...?\n\t      Generates a window event and arranges for it to be processed\n\t      just as if it had come from the window system.  Window gives the\n\t      path name of the window for which the event will be generated;\n\t      it may also be an identifier (such as returned by winfo id) as\n\t      long as it is for a window in the current application.  Event\n\t      provides a basic description of the event, such as <Shift-\n\t      Button-2> or <<Paste>>.  If Window is empty the whole screen is\n\t      meant, and coordinates are relative to the screen.  Event may\n\t      have any of the forms allowed for the sequence argument of the\n\t      bind command except that it must consist of a single event\n\t      pattern, not a sequence.\tOption-value pairs may be used to\n\t      specify additional attributes of the event, such as the x and y\n\t      mouse position;  see EVENT FIELDS below.\tIf the -when option is\n\t      not specified, the event is processed immediately:  all of the\n\t      handlers for the event will complete before the event generate\n\t      command returns.\tIf the -when option is specified then it\n\t      determines when the event is processed.  Certain events, such as\n\t      key events, require that the window has focus to receive the\n\t      event properly.\n\n       event info ?<<virtual>>?\n\t      Returns information about virtual events.  If the <<virtual>>\n\t      argument is omitted, the return value is a list of all the\n\t      virtual events that are currently defined.  If <<virtual>> is\n\t      specified then the return value is a list whose elements are the\n\t      physical event sequences currently defined for the given virtual\n\t      event;  if the virtual event is not defined then an empty string\n\t      is returned.\n\n\t      Note that virtual events that that are not bound to physical\n\t      event sequences are not returned by event info.\n\nEVENT FIELDS\n       The following options are supported for the event generate command.\n       These correspond to the “%” expansions allowed in binding scripts for\n       the bind command.\n\n       -above window\n\t      Window specifies the above field for the event, either as a\n\t      window path name or as an integer window id.  Valid for\n\t      Configure events.  Corresponds to the %a substitution for\n\t      binding scripts.\n\n       -borderwidth size\n\t      Size must be a screen distance;  it specifies the border_width\n\t      field for the event.  Valid for Configure events.  Corresponds\n\t      to the %B substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -button number\n\t      Number must be an integer;  it specifies the detail field for a\n\t      ButtonPress or ButtonRelease event, overriding any button\n\t      number provided in the base event argument.  Corresponds to the\n\t      %b substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -count number\n\t      Number must be an integer;  it specifies the count field for the\n\t      event.  Valid for Expose events.\tCorresponds to the %c\n\t      substitution for binding scripts. \t\t\t       │\n\n       -data string\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       │\n\t      String may be any value; it specifies the user_data field for    │\n\t      the event.  Only valid for virtual events.  Corresponds to the   │\n\t      %d substitution for virtual events in binding scripts.\n\n       -delta number\n\t      Number must be an integer;  it specifies the delta field for the\n\t      MouseWheel event.  The delta refers to the direction and\n\t      magnitude the mouse wheel was rotated.  Note the value is not a\n\t      screen distance but are units of motion in the mouse wheel.\n\t      Typically these values are multiples of 120.  For example, 120\n\t      should scroll the text widget up 4 lines and -240 would scroll\n\t      the text widget down 8 lines.  Of course, other widgets may\n\t      define different behaviors for mouse wheel motion.  This field\n\t      corresponds to the %D substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -detail detail\n\t      Detail specifies the detail field for the event and must be one\n\t      of the following:\n\n\t\t     NotifyAncestor\t     NotifyNonlinearVirtual\n\t\t     NotifyDetailNone\t     NotifyPointer\n\t\t     NotifyInferior\t     NotifyPointerRoot\n\t\t     NotifyNonlinear\t     NotifyVirtual\n\n\t      Valid for Enter, Leave, FocusIn and FocusOut events.\n\t      Corresponds to the %d substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -focus boolean\n\t      Boolean must be a boolean value;\tit specifies the focus field\n\t      for the event.  Valid for Enter and Leave events.  Corresponds\n\t      to the %f substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -height size\n\t      Size must be a screen distance;  it specifies the height field\n\t      for the event.  Valid for Configure events.  Corresponds to the\n\t      %h substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -keycode number\n\t      Number  must be an integer;  it specifies the keycode field for\n\t      the event.  Valid for KeyPress and KeyRelease events.\n\t      Corresponds to the %k substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -keysym name\n\t      Name must be the name of a valid keysym, such as g, space, or\n\t      Return;  its corresponding keycode value is used as the keycode\n\t      field for event, overriding any detail specified in the base\n\t      event argument.  Valid for KeyPress and KeyRelease events.\n\t      Corresponds to the %K substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -mode notify\n\t      Notify specifies the mode field for the event and must be one of\n\t      NotifyNormal, NotifyGrab, NotifyUngrab, or NotifyWhileGrabbed.\n\t      Valid for Enter, Leave, FocusIn, and FocusOut events.\n\t      Corresponds to the %m substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -override boolean\n\t      Boolean must be a boolean value;\tit specifies the\n\t      override_redirect field for the event.

Corresponds to the %o substitution for\n\t      binding scripts.\n\n       -place where\n\t      Where specifies the place field for the event;  it must be\n\t      either PlaceOnTop or PlaceOnBottom.  Valid for Circulate events.\n\t      Corresponds to the %p substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -root window\n\t      Window must be either a window path name or an integer window\n\t      identifier;  it specifies the root field for the event.  Valid\n\t      for KeyPress, KeyRelease, ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, Enter,\n\t      Leave, and Motion events.  Corresponds to the %R substitution\n\t      for binding scripts.\n\n       -rootx coord\n\t      Coord must be a screen distance;\tit specifies the x_root field\n\t      for the event.  Valid for KeyPress, KeyRelease, ButtonPress,\n\t      ButtonRelease, Enter, Leave, and Motion events.  Corresponds to\n\t      the %X substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -rooty coord\n\t      Coord must be a screen distance;\tit specifies the y_root field\n\t      for the event.  Valid for KeyPress, KeyRelease, ButtonPress,\n\t      ButtonRelease, Enter, Leave, and Motion events.  Corresponds to\n\t      the %Y substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -sendevent boolean\n\t      Boolean must be a boolean value;\tit specifies the send_event\n\t      field for the event.  Valid for all events.  Corresponds to the\n\t      %E substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -serial number\n\t      Number must be an integer;  it specifies the serial field for\n\t      the event.  Valid for all events.  Corresponds to the %#\n\t      substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -state state\n\t      State specifies the state field for the event.  For KeyPress,\n\t      KeyRelease, ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, Enter, Leave, and Motion\n\t      events it must be an integer value.  For Visibility events it\n\t      must be one of VisibilityUnobscured,\n\t      VisibilityPartiallyObscured, or VisibilityFullyObscured.\tThis\n\t      option overrides any modifiers such as Meta or Control specified\n\t      in the base event.  Corresponds to the %s substitution for\n\t      binding scripts.\n\n       -subwindow window\n\t      Window specifies the subwindow field for the event, either as a\n\t      path name for a Tk widget or as an integer window identifier.\n\t      Valid for KeyPress, KeyRelease, ButtonPress, ButtonRelease,\n\t      Enter, Leave, and Motion events.\tSimilar to %S substitution for\n\t      binding scripts.\n\n       -time integer\n\t      Integer must be an integer value;  it specifies the time field\n\t      for the event.

The\n\t      pointer will only warp to a window if it is mapped.\n\n       -width size\n\t      Size must be a screen distance;  it specifies the width field\n\t      for the event.  Valid for Configure events.  Corresponds to the\n\t      %w substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -when when\n\t      When determines when the event will be processed;  it must have\n\t      one of the following values:\n\n\t      now\tProcess the event immediately, before the command\n\t\t\treturns.  This also happens if the -when option is\n\t\t\tomitted.\n\n\t      tail\tPlace the event on Tcl's event queue behind any events\n\t\t\talready queued for this application.\n\n\t      head\tPlace the event at the front of Tcl's event queue, so\n\t\t\tthat it will be handled before any other events\n\t\t\talready queued.\n\n\t      mark\tPlace the event at the front of Tcl's event queue but\n\t\t\tbehind any other events already queued with -when\n\t\t\tmark.  This option is useful when generating a series\n\t\t\tof events that should be processed in order but at the\n\t\t\tfront of the queue.\n\n       -x coord\n\t      Coord must be a screen distance;\tit specifies the x field for\n\t      the event.

Corresponds to the %x substitution for\n\t      binding scripts.\tIf Window is empty the coordinate is relative\n\t      to the screen, and this option corresponds to the %X\n\t      substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       -y coord\n\t      Coord must be a screen distance;\tit specifies the y field for\n\t      the event.  Valid for KeyPress, KeyRelease, ButtonPress,\n\t      ButtonRelease, Motion, Enter, Leave, Expose, Configure, Gravity,\n\t      and Reparent events.  Corresponds to the %y substitution for\n\t      binding scripts.\tIf Window is empty the coordinate is relative\n\t      to the screen, and this option corresponds to the %Y\n\t      substitution for binding scripts.\n\n       Any options that are not specified when generating an event are filled\n       with the value 0, except for serial, which is filled with the next X\n       event serial number.\n\nPREDEFINED VIRTUAL EVENTS\n       Tk defines the following virtual events for the purposes of\n       notification:\n\n       <<AltUnderlined>>\n\t      This is sent to widget to notify it that the letter it has\n\t      underlined (as an accelerator indicator) with the -underline\n\t      option has been pressed in combination with the Alt key. The\n\t      usual response to this is to either focus into the widget (or\n\t      some related widget) or to invoke the widget.\n\n       <<ListboxSelect>>\n\t      This is sent to a listbox when the set of selected item(s) in\n\t      the listbox is updated.\n\n       <<MenuSelect>>\n\t      This is sent to a menu when the currently selected item in the\n\t      menu changes. It is intended for use with context-sensitive help\n\t      systems.\n\n       <<Modified>>\n\t      This is sent to a text widget when the contents of the widget\n\t      are changed.\n\n       <<Selection>>\n\t      This is sent to a text widget when the selection in the widget\n\t      is changed.\n\n       <<TraverseIn>>\n\t      This is sent to a widget when the focus enters the widget\n\t      because of a user-driven “tab to widget” action.\n\n       <<TraverseOut>>\n\t      This is sent to a widget when the focus leaves the widget\n\t      because of a user-driven “tab to widget” action.\n\n       Tk defines the following virtual events for the purposes of unifying\n       bindings across multiple platforms. Users expect them to behave in the\n       following way:\n\n       <<Clear>>\n\t      Delete the currently selected widget contents.\n\n       <<Copy>>\n\t      Copy the currently selected widget contents to the clipboard.\n\n       <<Cut>>\n\t      Move the currently selected widget contents to the clipboard.\n\n       <<Paste>>\n\t      Replace the currently selected widget contents with the contents\n\t      of the clipboard.\n\n       <<PasteSelection>>\n\t      Insert the contents of the selection at the mouse location.\n\t      (This event has meaningful %x and %y substitutions).\n\n       <<PrevWindow>>\n\t      Traverse to the previous window.\n\n       <<Redo>>\n\t      Redo one undone action.\n\n       <<Undo>>\n\t      Undo the last action.\n\nVIRTUAL EVENT EXAMPLES\n       In order for a virtual event binding to trigger, two things must\n       happen.\tFirst, the virtual event must be defined with the event add\n       command.  Second, a binding must be created for the virtual event with\n       the bind command.  Consider the following virtual event definitions:\n\t      event add <<Paste>> <Control-y>\n\t      event add <<Paste>> <Button-2>\n\t      event add <<Save>> <Control-X><Control-S>\n\t      event add <<Save>> <Shift-F12>\n       In the bind command, a virtual event can be bound like any other\n       builtin event type as follows:\n\t      bind Entry <<Paste>> {%W insert [selection get]}\n       The double angle brackets are used to specify that a virtual event is\n       being bound.  If the user types Control-y or presses button 2, or if a\n       <<Paste>> virtual event is synthesized with event generate, then the\n       <<Paste>> binding will be invoked.\n\n       If a virtual binding has the exact same sequence as a separate physical\n       binding, then the physical binding will take precedence.  Consider the\n       following example:\n\t      event add <<Paste>> <Control-y> <Meta-Control-y>\n\t      bind Entry <Control-y> {puts Control-y}\n\t      bind Entry <<Paste>> {puts Paste}\n       When the user types Control-y the <Control-y> binding will be invoked,\n       because a physical event is considered more specific than a virtual\n       event, all other things being equal.  However, when the user types\n       Meta-Control-y the <<Paste>> binding will be invoked, because the Meta\n       modifier in the physical pattern associated with the virtual binding is\n       more specific than the <Control-y> sequence for the physical event.\n\n       Bindings on a virtual event may be created before the virtual event\n       exists.\tIndeed, the virtual event never actually needs to be defined,\n       for instance, on platforms where the specific virtual event would\n       meaningless or ungeneratable.\n\n       When a definition of a virtual event changes at run time, all windows\n       will respond immediately to the new definition.\tStarting from the\n       preceding example, if the following code is executed:\n\t      bind <Entry> <Control-y> {}\n\t      event add <<Paste>> <Key-F6>\n       the behavior will change such in two ways.  First, the shadowed\n       <<Paste>> binding will emerge.  Typing Control-y will no longer invoke\n       the <Control-y> binding, but instead invoke the virtual event\n       <<Paste>>.  Second, pressing the F6 key will now also invoke the\n       <<Paste>> binding."
