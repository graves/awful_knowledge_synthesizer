If there is no argument or the\n     argument is ‘-’, the tty line is assumed to be open as file descriptor 0.\n\n     The type argument can be used to make getty treat the terminal line\n     specially.  This argument is used as an index into the gettytab(5)\n     database, to determine the characteristics of the line.  If there is no\n     argument, or there is no such table, the default table is used.  If there\n     is no /etc/gettytab a set of system defaults is used.  If indicated by\n     the table located, getty will clear the terminal screen, print a banner\n     heading, and prompt for a login name.  Usually either the banner or the\n     login prompt will include the system hostname."
