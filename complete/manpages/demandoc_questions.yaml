Escape sequences are omitted from\n     the output.\n\n     Its arguments are as follows:\n\n     -w      Output a word list.  This outputs each word of text on its own\n\t     line.  A \"word\", in this case, refers to whitespace-delimited\n\t     terms beginning with at least two letters and not consisting of\n\t     any escape sequences.  Words have their leading and trailing\n\t     punctuation (double-quotes, sentence punctuation, etc.) stripped.\n\n     file ...\n\t     The input files.\n\n     If a document is not well-formed, it is skipped.\n\n     The -i, -k, -m, and -p flags are silently discarded for calling\n     compatibility with the historical deroff."
