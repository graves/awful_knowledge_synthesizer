Several modules are provided\n     that allow access to existing directory systems:\n\n\t   •   Active Directory\n\t   •   LDAP\n\t   •   Local Database\n\t   •   NIS\n\n   Modules\n     opendirectoryd modules have specific capabilities:\n\n\t   Authentication  password verification, password changes, etc.\n\t   Connection\t   general connections used for queries, record\n\t\t\t   modifications, etc.\n\t   Discovery\t   location and prioritization of servers to contact\n\t\t\t   (a.k.a., service discovery)\n\t   Unspecified\t   a generic module used for unspecified purpose\n\t\t\t   (usually to extend capabilities)\n\n     Third party plugins developed for \"DirectoryService\" are supported via\n     dspluginhelperd(8)."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `opendirectoryd`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nOpen Directory\n     Open Directory is a technology which includes a client API abstraction\n     layer, a directory server, and the opendirectoryd daemon.\tThis allows\n     clients to utilize a single API to access a variety of directory servers\n     simultaneously or configure their own directory server.\n\n     Open Directory forms the foundation of how Mac OS X accesses all\n     authoritative configuration information (users, groups, mounts, managed\n     desktop data, etc.).  This allows use of virtually any directory system\n     via Apple and third party modules.\n\n     Configuration of opendirectoryd is done via \"System Preferences\" under\n     the \"Users & Groups\" preference pane. Advanced settings are available by\n     using \"Open Directory Utility...\" within \"Users & Groups\" preference\n     pane.\n\n     More information is available from the Open Directory website:\n\n\t http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/opendirectory/\n\n   Open Directory Server\n     Open Directory Server utilizes OpenLDAP which is included as part of Mac\n     OS X Client, Mac OS X Server, and Darwin. OpenLDAP provides a robust and\n     scalable platform for serving directory-based information for both\n     standalone and networked systems."
