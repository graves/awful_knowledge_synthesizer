The SNMPv3 VACM specifications (see RFC2575) define assorted\n       tables to specify groups of users, MIB views, and authorised access\n       settings.  These snmpvacm commands effectively create or delete rows in\n       the appropriate one of these tables, and match the equivalent configure\n       directives which are documented in the snmpd.conf(5) man page.\n\n       A fuller explanation of how these operate can be found in the project\n       FAQ.\n\nSUB-COMMANDS\n   createSec2Group MODEL SECURITYNAME GROUPNAME\n       Create an entry in the SNMPv3 security name to group table.  This table\n       allows a single access control entry to be applied to a number of users\n       (or 'principals'), and is indexed by the security model and security\n       name values.\n\n       MODEL\n\n\t      An integer representing the security model, taking one of the\n\t      following values:\n\t      1 - reserved for SNMPv1\n\t      2 - reserved for SNMPv2c\n\t      3 - User-based Security Model (USM)"

A MIB view consists of a\n       family of view subtrees which may be individually included in or\n       (occasionally) excluded from the view.
