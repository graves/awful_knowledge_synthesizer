Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `mkfile`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nMKFILE(8)\t\t    System Manager's Manual\t\t     MKFILE(8)\n\nNAME\n     mkfile â€“ create a file\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     mkfile [-nv] size[b|k|m|g] file ...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     mkfile creates one or more files that are suitable for use as NFS-mounted\n     swap areas.  The sticky bit is set, and the file is padded with zeroes by\n     default.  Non-root users must set the sticky bit using chmod(1).  The\n     default size unit is bytes, but the following suffixes may be used to\n     multiply by the given factor: b (512), k (1024), m (1048576), and g\n     (1073741824).\n\nOPTIONS\n     -n     Create an empty filename.  The size is noted, but disk blocks\n\t    aren't allocated until data is written to them.\n\n     -v     Verbose.  Report the names and sizes of created files.\n\nWARNING\n     If a client's swap file is removed and recreated, it must be re-exported\n     before the client will be able to access it.  This action may only be\n     done when the client is not running.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     chmod(2), stat(2), sticky(7)"
