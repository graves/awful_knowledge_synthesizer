Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `avbcapture`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\navbcapture(1)\t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t avbcapture(1)\n\nNAME\n     avbcapture â€“ Audio Video Bridging traffic capture tool.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     avbcapture command <arguments>\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The avbcapture executable is used for capture a PCAPNG file containing\n     gPTP and AVTP stream packets.\n\n\n     The following options are available for the pcap command:\n\n     --interface bsd-name\n\t The interface to capture traffic on. This option may be provided\n\t multiple times to capture simultaneously from multiple interfaces to\n\t the one file.\n\n     --output path\n\t Specifies the path to the PCAPNG file to put all the captured\n\t traffic.\n\n     --ring\n\t Use a ring of packets and only output to file when the capture is\n\t stopped.\n\n     --length num-packets\n\t The number of packets to keep in the ring. Defaults to 2,561,000 if\n\t not specified.\n\n     --allow-tap\n\t Allow the tool to tap the receive queue rather than adding a stream\n\t capture allowing capture on a live system. This could potentially\n\t cause performance issues resulting in packets being lost.\n\n     --force-tap\n\t Force using the receive queue rather than adding a stream capture\n\t allowing capture on a live system. This could potentially cause\n\t performance issues resulting in packets being lost.\n\nDarwin\t\t\t\t    1/5/24\t\t\t\tDarwin"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the avbcapture tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use avbcapture to capture packets from multiple network interfaces and save them to a PCAPNG file?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using avbcapture to capture a specified number of packets into a ring buffer and output them to a file when the capture is stopped?
