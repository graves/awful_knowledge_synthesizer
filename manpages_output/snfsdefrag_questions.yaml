Reducing\n       the number of extents in a file improves performance by minimizing disk\n       head movement when performing I/O.  In addition, with fewer extents,\n       Xsan File System Manager (FSM) overhead is reduced.\n\n       snfsdefrag can be used to migrate files off of an existing stripe group\n       and on to other storage pools by using the -G option and setting the -m\n       option to 0. If affinities are associated with a file that is being\n       defragmented, new extents are created using the existing file affinity,\n       unless being overridden by the -k option.  If the -k option is\n       specified, the files are moved to a stripe group with the specified\n       affinity. Without -k, files are moved to any available stripe group.\n       This migration capability can be especially useful when a storage pool\n       is going out of service.  See the use of the -G option in the EXAMPLES\n       section below.\n\n       In addition to defragmenting and migrating files, snfsdefrag can be\n       used to list the extents in a file (see the -e option) or to prune away\n       unused space that has been preallocated for the file (see the -p\n       option).\n\n       Note: Free space in a storage pool can also become fragmented.  To\n       address this issue, see the sgdefrag command.\n\n       Note: The snfsdefrag utility is no longer the preferred tool to prepare\n       a storage pool for retirement.  Use the sgoffload utility instead.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -A     Do not attempt to temporarily stop I/O on an open file by\n\t      setting the administrative lock on the file.\n\n       -b     Show extent size in blocks instead of kilobytes.\tOnly useful\n\t      with the -e and -E (list extents) options.\n\n       -c     This option causes snfsdefrag to just display an extent count\n\t      instead of defragmenting files.  See also the -t and -T options.\n\n       -D     Turns on debug messages.\n\n       -d     Causes snfsdefrag to operate on files containing extents that\n\t      have depths that are different than the current depth for the\n\t      extent's storage pool.  This option is useful for reclaiming\n\t      disk space that has become \"shadowed\" after cvupdatefs has been\n\t      run for stripe group expansion.  Note that when -d is used, a\n\t      file may be defragmented due to the stripe depth in one or more\n\t      of its extents OR due to the file's extent count.\n\n       -e     This option causes snfsdefrag to not actually attempt the\n\t      defragmentation, but instead report the list of extents\n\t      contained in the file.  The extent information includes the\n\t      starting file relative offset, starting and ending storage pool\n\t      block addresses, the size of the extent, the depth of the\n\t      extent, and the storage pool number.  See also the -t option.\n\n       -E     This option has the same effect as the -e option except that\n\t      file relative offsets and starting and ending stripe group block\n\t      addresses that are stripe-aligned are highlighted with an\n\t      asterisk (*).  Also, starting storage pool addresses that are\n\t      equally misaligned with the file relative offset are highlighted\n\t      with a plus sign (+).  See also the -t option.\n\n       -F     This option causes snfsdefrag to skip resource forks for file\n\t      systems on which the namedStreams option is enabled."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `snfsdefrag`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nADVANCED FRAGMENTATION ANALYSIS\n       There are two major types of fragmentation to note: file fragmentation\n       and free space fragmentation. File fragmentation is measured by the\n       number of file extents used to store a file. A file extent is a\n       contiguous allocation unit within a file. When a large enough\n       contiguous space cannot be found to allocate to a file, multiple\n       smaller\tfile extents are created. Each extent represents a different\n       physical spot in a storage pool. Requiring multiple extents to address\n       file data impacts performance in a number of ways. First, the file\n       system must do more work looking up locations for a file's data.  Also,\n       having file data spread across many different locations in the file\n       system requires the storage hardware to do more work while reading a\n       file. On a disk there will be increased head movements, as the drive\n       seeks around to read in each data extent. Many disks also attempt to\n       optimize I/O performance, for example, by attempting to predict\n       upcoming read locations. When a file's data is contiguous these\n       optimizations work well. However, with a fragmented file the drive\n       optimizations are not nearly as efficient."

    Manpage text:

    A file's fragmentation should be viewed more as a percentage than as a
           hard number. While it's true that a file of nearly any size with 50000
           fragments is extremely fragmented and should be defragmented, a file
           that has 500 fragments that are mostly one or two file system blocks
           (4096 bytes) in length is also very fragmented. Keeping files to under
           10% fragmentation is the ideal, and how close you come to that ideal is
           a compromise based on real-world factors (file system use, file sizes
           and their life span, opportunities to run snfsdefrag, etc.).

           In an attempt to reduce fragmentation (file and free space),
           Administrators can try using the Allocation Session Reservation
           feature.  This feature is managed using the GUI or by modifying the
           allocSessionReservationSize parameter, see snfs_config(5).  See also
           the Xsan Tuning Guide.

           Some common causes of fragmentation are having very full stripe groups
           (possibly because of affinities), a file system that has a lot of
           fragmented free space (deleting a fragmented file produces fragmented
           free space), heavy use of CIFS or NFS which typically use out-of-order
           allocations resulting in unoptimized (uncoalesced) allocations, or an
           application that writes files in a random order.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `snfsdefrag`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nsnfsdefrag is designed to detect files which contain file fragmentation\n       and coalesce that data onto a minimal number of file extents. The\n       efficiency of snfsdefrag is dependent on the  state of the file\n       system's free data blocks, or free space.\n\n       The second type of fragmentation is free space fragmentation. The file\n       system's free space is the pool of unallocated data blocks. Space\n       allocation for new files, as well as allocations for extending existing\n       files, comes from the file system's free space. Free space\n       fragmentation is measured by the number of fragments of contiguous free\n       blocks.\tFragmentation in the file system's free space affects the file\n       system's ability to allocate large extents. A file can only have an\n       extent as large as the largest contiguous block of free space. Thus\n       free space fragmentation can lead to file fragmentation in larger\n       files. As snfsdefrag processes fragmented files it attempts to use\n       large enough free space fragments to create a new defragmented file\n       space. If free space is too fragmented snfsdefrag may not be able to\n       allocate a large enough extent for the file's data. In the case that\n       snfsdefrag must use multiple extents in the defragmented file, it will\n       only proceed if the processed file will have fewer extents than the\n       original.  Otherwise snfsdefrag will abort that file's defrag process\n       and move on to remaining defrag requests."

Some examples require additional tools such as awk and sort.\n\n       Reporting a specific file's fragmentation (extent count).\n\n\t      # snfsdefrag -c <filename>\n\n       Report all files, their extents, the total # of files and extents, and\n       the average number of extents per files. Beware that this command walks\n       the entire file system so it can take a while and cause the performance\n       of applications to degrade while running.\n\n\t      # snfsdefrag -r -c -t <mount point>\n\n       The following command will create a report showing each file's path,\n       followed by extent count, with the report sorted by extent count. Files\n       with the greatest number of extents will show up at the top of the\n       list.\n\n       Replace <fsname> in the following example with the name of your Xsan\n       file system. The report is written to stdout and should be redirected\n       to a file."

There may be more than one file that matches the 32-bit\n       inode number."
