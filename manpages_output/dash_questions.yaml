This version has\n     many features which make it appear similar in some respects to the Korn\n     shell, but it is not a Korn shell clone (see ksh(1)).  Only features\n     designated by POSIX, plus a few Berkeley extensions, are being\n     incorporated into this shell.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `dash`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nOverview\n     The shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the\n     terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.\tIt is\n     the program that is running when a user logs into the system (although a\n     user can select a different shell with the chsh(1) command).  The shell\n     implements a language that has flow control constructs, a macro facility\n     that provides a variety of features in addition to data storage, along\n     with built in history and line editing capabilities.  It incorporates\n     many features to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the\n     interpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive\n     use (shell scripts).  That is, commands can be typed directly to the\n     running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed\n     directly by the shell.\n\n   Invocation\n     If no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is\n     connected to a terminal (or if the -i flag is set), and the -c option is\n     not present, the shell is considered an interactive shell.  An\n     interactive shell generally prompts before each command and handles\n     programming and command errors differently (as described below).  When\n     first starting, the shell inspects argument 0, and if it begins with a\n     dash ‘-’, the shell is also considered a login shell.  This is normally\n     done automatically by the system when the user first logs in.  A login\n     shell first reads commands from the files /etc/profile and .profile if\n     they exist.  If the environment variable ENV is set on entry to an\n     interactive shell, or is set in the .profile of a login shell, the shell\n     next reads commands from the file named in ENV.  Therefore, a user should\n     place commands that are to be executed only at login time in the .profile\n     file, and commands that are executed for every interactive shell inside\n     the ENV file.  To set the ENV variable to some file, place the following\n     line in your .profile of your home directory"

    Manpage text:

    Shell builtins are executed internally to the shell, without spawning a
         new process.

         Otherwise, if the command name doesn't match a function or builtin, the
         command is searched for as a normal program in the file system (as
         described in the next section).  When a normal program is executed, the
         shell runs the program, passing the arguments and the environment to the
         program.  If the program is not a normal executable file (i.e., if it
         does not begin with the "magic number" whose ASCII representation is
         "#!", so execve(2) returns ENOEXEC then) the shell will interpret the
         program in a subshell.  The child shell will reinitialize itself in this
         case, so that the effect will be as if a new shell had been invoked to
         handle the ad-hoc shell script, except that the location of hashed
         commands located in the parent shell will be remembered by the child.

         Note that previous versions of this document and the source code itself
         misleadingly and sporadically refer to a shell script without a magic
         number as a "shell procedure".

    Manpage text:

    White Space Splitting (Field Splitting)
         After parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion
         the shell scans the results of expansions and substitutions that did not
         occur in double-quotes for field splitting and multiple fields can
         result.

         The shell treats each character of the IFS as a delimiter and uses the
         delimiters to split the results of parameter expansion and command
         substitution into fields.

       Pathname Expansion (File Name Generation)
         Unless the -f flag is set, file name generation is performed after word
         splitting is complete.  Each word is viewed as a series of patterns,
         separated by slashes.  The process of expansion replaces the word with
         the names of all existing files whose names can be formed by replacing
         each pattern with a string that matches the specified pattern.  There are
         two restrictions on this: first, a pattern cannot match a string
         containing a slash, and second, a pattern cannot match a string starting
         with a period unless the first character of the pattern is a period.  The
         next section describes the patterns used for both Pathname Expansion and
         the case command.
