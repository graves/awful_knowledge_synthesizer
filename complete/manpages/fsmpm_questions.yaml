It registers an RPC identifier to the system's\n       portmap daemon. The fsmpm publishes a well known port where the Xsan\n       File System Manager (FSM) daemons can register their volume name and\n       port access number. All clients then talk to their local FSS port\n       mapper to discover access information for their associated service.\n       This process runs in the background and is started at boot time. It is\n       enabled or disabled (along with the volume) via chkconfig(8) or init.d\n       using the acfs key word.\n\nOPTIONS\n       Apple Internal Use Only - contact support before adding or modifying\n       command line arguments to fsmpm.  Changes from the defaults may result\n       in intermittent or total failure of Xsan.  Options may change abruptly\n       between releases."

    Manpage text:

    NOTE: Defaults specified with '--'.

    FSNAMESERVERS
           The fsmpm reads the file /Library/Preferences/Xsan/fsnameservers to
           establish file system name servers for the Xsan file system services.
           This list is used to coordinate the whereabouts of Xsan file system
           servers.

           A name server list must be established on each client that has Xsan
           installed so that all clients can discover the location of the Xsan FSM
           servers. It is important that this list is consistent across the SAN.
           Inconsistent fsnameservers configuration may result in the inability
           for some clients to find a file system service. See fsnameservers(4)
           for specifics of the file format.

    FSMLIST
           The fsmpm is responsible for launching the FSM daemon(s). If
           /Library/Preferences/Xsan/fsmlist exists then the fsmpm reads from the
           list file and starts the FSM daemons that are specified. If no
           /Library/Preferences/Xsan/fsmlist file exists then the fsmpm tries to
           launch the FSM daemon for the volume named default. See fsmlist(4) for
           specifics of the file format.
