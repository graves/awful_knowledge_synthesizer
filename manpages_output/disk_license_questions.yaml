It can report current disk licensing\n       status and create reports for manually requesting disk licenses on an\n       MDC.\n\n       All the disks in all of an MDC's file systems are categorized into\n       Quantum Branded, Quantum Certified, and Uncertified (all other) as\n       defined in the quantum_disk_catalog.dat database.\n\n       The Disk Usage licenses are free, but aid Quantum support in\n       understanding the usage and requirements of a site.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -c <filename>\n\t      Use catalog <filename> instead of the default disk-license-\n\t      request report file.\n\n       -C     Only print the Disk Catalog to standard out.\n\n       -d <n> Print additional details on a per-file-system basis.  Larger\n\t      values for <n> yield more details, up to a point."
