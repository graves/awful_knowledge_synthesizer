If this is the last reference to the underlying object,\n     the object will be deactivated.  For example, on the last close of a file\n     the current seek pointer associated with the file is lost; on the last\n     close of a socket(2) associated naming information and queued data are\n     discarded; on the last close of a file holding an advisory lock the lock\n     is released (see further flock(2)).\n\n     When a process exits, all associated file descriptors are freed, but\n     since there is a limit on active descriptors per processes, the close()\n     function call is useful when a large quantity of file descriptors are\n     being handled.\n\n     When a process forks (see fork(2)), all descriptors for the new child\n     process reference the same objects as they did in the parent before the\n     fork.  If a new process is then to be run using execve(2), the process\n     would normally inherit these descriptors.\tMost of the descriptors can be\n     rearranged with dup2(2) or deleted with close() before the execve is\n     attempted, but if some of these descriptors will still be needed if the\n     execve fails, it is necessary to arrange for them to be closed if the\n     execve succeeds.  For this reason, the call “fcntl(d, F_SETFD, 1)” is\n     provided, which arranges that a descriptor will be closed after a\n     successful execve; the call “fcntl(d, F_SETFD, 0)” restores the default,\n     which is to not close the descriptor."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the close system call?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the close() function to properly release a file descriptor after reading from a file?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain how to use close() in conjunction with fcntl() to ensure a descriptor is closed after an execve call?
