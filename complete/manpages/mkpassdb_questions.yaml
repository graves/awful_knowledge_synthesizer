These operations include the\n     creation and destruction of the database itself, the creation of the RSA\n     security keys that establish the identity of the password server, the\n     trusted mechanism list, and the genesis of administrator accounts. It\n     also allows the root account to make some password server changes on the\n     local system.\n\n     -deleteslot\t       Invalidates a slot ID in the database.\n     -dump\t\t       Outputs all of the User IDs and their\n\t\t\t       corresponding user names. If a slot-ID is\n\t\t\t       specified, it prints out more detailed\n\t\t\t       information for a single slot. If the [-v]\n\t\t\t       option is used, additional columns are\n\t\t\t       included.\n     -header\t\t       Outputs the database header information.\n     -kerberize \t       Attempts to add kerberos principals for all\n\t\t\t       non-kerberos accounts in password server.\n     -key\t\t       Outputs the RSA public key stored in the\n\t\t\t       database.\n     -list\t\t       Outputs all of the SASL mechanisms available to\n\t\t\t       the password server.\n     -mergedb\t\t       This command is a low-level command that is\n\t\t\t       invoked by a higher-level tool in normal usage.\n\t\t\t       Refer to the restoredb command in the\n\t\t\t       slapconfig man page.  This command merges a\n\t\t\t       snapshot of the password server database into\n\t\t\t       the current database whether or not the daemon\n\t\t\t       is running.  This command takes existing LDAP\n\t\t\t       users, looks for their data in the specified db\n\t\t\t       file, and merges their db information.  If\n\t\t\t       there is data in the db without a corresponding\n\t\t\t       LDAP user or computer, it is not merged.  The\n\t\t\t       identity elements of the password server,\n\t\t\t       including RSA keys and replica name, are\n\t\t\t       changed to the snapshot's contents.\n     -mergeparent\t       This command is a low-level command that is\n\t\t\t       invoked by a higher-level tool in normal usage.\n\t\t\t       Refer to the mergedb command in the slapconfig\n\t\t\t       man page.  This command merges a snapshot of\n\t\t\t       the password server database into the current\n\t\t\t       database whether or not the daemon is running.\n\t\t\t       This command takes existing LDAP\n\t\t\t\tusers, looks for their data in the specified\n\t\t\t       db file, and merges their db information.  If\n\t\t\t       there is data in the db without a corresponding\n\t\t\t       LDAP user or compute r, it is not merged.  The\n\t\t\t       current identity of the password server is\n\t\t\t       preserved.\n     -setadmin\t\t       Promotes a slot-ID to have administrator\n\t\t\t       privileges for the password server. By default,\n\t\t\t       administrators set with mkpassdb receive the\n\t\t\t       most priveleged rank (0).\n     -setglobalpolicy\t       Sets the default policies for all users.\n     -setkerberos\t       Assigns a Kerberos realm to a password server\n\t\t\t       account.\n     -setkeyagent\t       Promotes a slot-ID to have enough administrator\n\t\t\t       privileges to retrieve session keys on behalf\n\t\t\t       of other accounts.\n     -setcomputeraccount       Informs the password server that the account\n\t\t\t       belongs to a computer rather than a user.\n\t\t\t       Computer accounts are not subject to policies\n\t\t\t       and do not expire. Using the optional \"off\"\n\t\t\t       argument changes the state back to a user\n\t\t\t       account.\n     -setrealm\t\t       Sets the password server's SASL realm.\n     -getreplicationinterval   Gets the number of seconds between replication\n\t\t\t       attempts.\n     -setreplicationinterval   Sets the number of seconds between replication\n\t\t\t       attempts.\n     -rekeydb\t\t       Generates a new RSA public/private key pair for\n\t\t\t       the database. Valid sizes are 1024, 2048, or\n\t\t\t       3072.  This command should be invoked by a\n\t\t\t       higher-level tool. If run from the command\n\t\t\t       line, existing users will not be able to\n\t\t\t       authenticate. The PasswordService daemon must\n\t\t\t       be turned off with, \"NeST -stoppasswordserver\"\n\t\t\t       before this command can be used."
