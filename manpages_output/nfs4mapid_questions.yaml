In the second form shows the\n     translations from opendirectoy GUIDS to NFSv4 strings. The well known\n     strings names (which are distinguished by a trailing ‘@’ ), such as\n     \"OWNER@\" and \"GROUP@\" are represented locally by GUIDs and may not map to\n     uids or gids. To map those GUIDS to NFSv4 strings use this form. The\n     first form can be used to map the well known ids to GUIDs.  nfs4mapid\n     does this by looking at the trailing ‘@’ sign. Note that NFSv4 well known\n     names are always groups and are used in ACEs.  In the third form, it\n     shows the mapping from uids to the NFSv4 user@domain form.  Similarly, in\n     the last form it shows the mapping from gids to the NFSv4 group@domain.\n     nfs4mapid will also show the intermediate GUID translation if used. The\n     NFSv4 domain name should be set with dscl(1).  See opendirectory(8) for\n     instructions."
