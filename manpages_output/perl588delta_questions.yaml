    Manpage text:

    Building with Borland's compilers on Win32 should work more smoothly.
           In particular Steve Hay has worked to side step many warnings emitted
           by their compilers and at least one C compiler internal error.

           "Configure" will now detect "clearenv" and "unsetenv", thanks to a
           patch from Alan Burlison. It will also probe for "futimes" and whether
           "sprintf" correctly returns the length of the formatted string, which
           will both be used in perl 5.8.9.

           There are improved hints for next-3.0, vmesa, IX, Darwin, Solaris,
           Linux, DEC/OSF, HP-UX and MPE/iX

           Perl extensions on Windows now can be statically built into the Perl
           DLL, thanks to a work by Vadim Konovalov. (This improvement was
           actually in 5.8.7, but was accidentally omitted from perl587delta).

    Selected Bug Fixes
       no warnings 'category' works correctly with -w
           Previously when running with warnings enabled globally via "-w",
           selective disabling of specific warning categories would actually turn
           off all warnings.  This is now fixed; now "no warnings 'io';" will only
           turn off warnings in the "io" class. Previously it would erroneously
           turn off all warnings.

    This bug fix may cause some programs to start correctly issuing
           warnings.

       Remove over-optimisation
           Perl 5.8.4 introduced a change so that assignments of "undef" to a
           scalar, or of an empty list to an array or a hash, were optimised away.
           As this could cause problems when "goto" jumps were involved, this
           change has been backed out.

       sprintf() fixes
           Using the sprintf() function with some formats could lead to a buffer
           overflow in some specific cases. This has been fixed, along with
           several other bugs, notably in bounds checking.

           In related fixes, it was possible for badly written code that did not
           follow the documentation of "Sys::Syslog" to have formatting
           vulnerabilities.  "Sys::Syslog" has been changed to protect people from
           poor quality third party code.

       Debugger and Unicode slowdown
           It had been reported that running under perl's debugger when processing
           Unicode data could cause unexpectedly large slowdowns. The most likely
           cause of this was identified and fixed by Nicholas Clark.

    Manpage text:

    Andy Lester supplied many improvements to determine which function
           parameters and local variables could actually be declared "const" to
           the C compiler. Steve Peters provided new *_set macros and reworked the
           core to use these rather than assigning to macros in LVALUE context.

           Dave Mitchell improved the lexer debugging output under "-DT"

           Nicholas Clark changed the string buffer allocation so that it is now
           rounded up to the next multiple of 4 (or 8 on platforms with 64 bit
           pointers). This should reduce the number of calls to "realloc" without
           actually using any extra memory.

           The "HV"'s array of "HE*"s is now allocated at the correct (minimal)
           size, thanks to another change by Nicholas Clark. Compile with
           "-DPERL_USE_LARGE_HV_ALLOC" to use the old, sloppier, default.

           For XS or embedding debugging purposes, if perl is compiled with
           "-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS_FORK_DUMP" in addition to
           "-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS" then a child process is "fork"ed just before
           global destruction, which is used to display the values of any scalars
           found to have leaked at the end of global destruction. Without this,
           the scalars have already been freed sufficiently at the point of
           detection that it is impossible to produce any meaningful dump of their
           contents.  This feature was implemented by the indefatigable Nicholas
           Clark, based on an idea by Mike Giroux.
