  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the filtercalltree tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use filtercalltree to prune a call tree file by removing branches with a malloc size less than 500K?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using filtercalltree to invert the call tree order and charge system libraries?
