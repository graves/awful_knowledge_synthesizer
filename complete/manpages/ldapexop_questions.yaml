  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the ldapexop tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use ldapexop to perform a whoami extended operation and retrieve the client's identity?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using ldapexop to send an LDAP extended operation with the OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.3 and include additional data as base64 encoded string?
