The result is a vector as well.\n\n       ::math::geometry::- point1 point2\n\t      Compute the difference (point1 - point2) of the two vectors\n\t      given as points and return it. The result is a vector as well.\n\n       ::math::geometry::p x y\n\t      Construct a point from its coordinates and return it as the\n\t      result of the command.\n\n       ::math::geometry::distance point1 point2\n\t      Compute the distance between the two points and return it as the\n\t      result of the command. This is in essence the same as\n\n\t\t  math::geometry::length [math::geomtry::- point1 point2]\n\n\n       ::math::geometry::length point\n\t      Compute the length of the vector and return it as the result of\n\t      the command.\n\n       ::math::geometry::s* factor point\n\t      Scale the vector by the factor and return it as the result of\n\t      the command. This is a vector as well.\n\n       ::math::geometry::direction angle\n\t      Given the angle in degrees this command computes and returns the\n\t      unit vector pointing into this direction. The vector for angle\n\t      == 0 points to the right (up), and for angle == 90 up (north).\n\n       ::math::geometry::h length\n\t      Returns a horizontal vector on the X-axis of the specified\n\t      length.  Positive lengths point to the right (east).\n\n       ::math::geometry::v length\n\t      Returns a vertical vector on the Y-axis of the specified length.\n\t      Positive lengths point down (south).\n\n       ::math::geometry::between point1 point2 s\n\t      Compute the point which is at relative distance s between the\n\t      two points and return it as the result of the command. A\n\t      relative distance of 0 returns point1, the distance 1 returns\n\t      point2.  Distances < 0 or > 1 extrapolate along the line between\n\t      the two point.\n\n       ::math::geometry::octant point\n\t      Compute the octant of the circle the point is in and return it\n\t      as the result of the command. The possible results are\n\n\t      [1]    east\n\n\t      [2]    northeast\n\n\t      [3]    north\n\n\t      [4]    northwest\n\n\t      [5]    west\n\n\t      [6]    southwest\n\n\t      [7]    south\n\n\t      [8]    southeast\n       Each octant is the arc of the circle +/- 22.5 degrees from the cardinal\n       direction the octant is named for.\n\n       ::math::geometry::rect nw se\n\t      Construct a rectangle from its northwest and southeast corners\n\t      and return it as the result of the command.\n\n       ::math::geometry::nwse rect\n\t      Extract the northwest and southeast corners of the rectangle and\n\t      return them as the result of the command (a 2-element list\n\t      containing the points, in the named order).\n\n       ::math::geometry::angle line\n\t      Calculate the angle from the positive x-axis to a given line (in\n\t      two dimensions only).\n\n\t      list line\n\t\t     Coordinates of the line\n\n\n       ::math::geometry::calculateDistanceToLine P line\n\t      Calculate the distance of point P to the (infinite) line and\n\t      return the result\n\n\t      list P List of two numbers, the coordinates of the point\n\n\t      list line\n\t\t     List of four numbers, the coordinates of two points on\n\t\t     the line\n\n\n       ::math::geometry::calculateDistanceToLineSegment P linesegment\n\t      Calculate the distance of point P to the (finite) line segment\n\t      and return the result.\n\n\t      list P List of two numbers, the coordinates of the point\n\n\t      list linesegment\n\t\t     List of four numbers, the coordinates of the first and\n\t\t     last points of the line segment"
