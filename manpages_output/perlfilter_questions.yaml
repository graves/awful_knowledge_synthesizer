    NAME
           perlfilter - Source Filters

    DESCRIPTION
           This article is about a little-known feature of Perl called source
           filters. Source filters alter the program text of a module before Perl
           sees it, much as a C preprocessor alters the source text of a C program
           before the compiler sees it. This article tells you more about what
           source filters are, how they work, and how to write your own.

           The original purpose of source filters was to let you encrypt your
           program source to prevent casual piracy. This isn't all they can do, as
           you'll soon learn. But first, the basics.

    CONCEPTS
           Before the Perl interpreter can execute a Perl script, it must first
           read it from a file into memory for parsing and compilation. If that
           script itself includes other scripts with a "use" or "require"
           statement, then each of those scripts will have to be read from their
           respective files as well.

           Now think of each logical connection between the Perl parser and an
           individual file as a source stream. A source stream is created when the
           Perl parser opens a file, it continues to exist as the source code is
           read into memory, and it is destroyed when Perl is finished parsing the
           file. If the parser encounters a "require" or "use" statement in a
           source stream, a new and distinct stream is created just for that file.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfilter`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe diagram below represents a single source stream, with the flow of\n       source from a Perl script file on the left into the Perl parser on the\n       right. This is how Perl normally operates.\n\n\t   file -------> parser\n\n       There are two important points to remember:\n\n       1.   Although there can be any number of source streams in existence at\n\t    any given time, only one will be active.\n\n       2.   Every source stream is associated with only one file.\n\n       A source filter is a special kind of Perl module that intercepts and\n       modifies a source stream before it reaches the parser. A source filter\n       changes our diagram like this:\n\n\t   file ----> filter ----> parser\n\n       If that doesn't make much sense, consider the analogy of a command\n       pipeline. Say you have a shell script stored in the compressed file\n       trial.gz. The simple pipeline command below runs the script without\n       needing to create a temporary file to hold the uncompressed file.\n\n\t   gunzip -c trial.gz | sh"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfilter`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIn this case, the data flow from the pipeline can be represented as\n       follows:\n\n\t   trial.gz ----> gunzip ----> sh\n\n       With source filters, you can store the text of your script compressed\n       and use a source filter to uncompress it for Perl's parser:\n\n\t    compressed\t\t gunzip\n\t   Perl program ---> source filter ---> parser\n\nUSING FILTERS\n       So how do you use a source filter in a Perl script? Above, I said that\n       a source filter is just a special kind of module. Like all Perl\n       modules, a source filter is invoked with a use statement.\n\n       Say you want to pass your Perl source through the C preprocessor before\n       execution. As it happens, the source filters distribution comes with a\n       C preprocessor filter module called Filter::cpp.\n\n       Below is an example program, \"cpp_test\", which makes use of this\n       filter.\tLine numbers have been added to allow specific lines to be\n       referenced easily.\n\n\t   1: use Filter::cpp;\n\t   2: #define TRUE 1\n\t   3: $a = TRUE;\n\t   4: print \"a = $a\\n\";"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfilter`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nWhen you execute this script, Perl creates a source stream for the\n       file. Before the parser processes any of the lines from the file, the\n       source stream looks like this:\n\n\t   cpp_test ---------> parser\n\n       Line 1, \"use Filter::cpp\", includes and installs the \"cpp\" filter\n       module. All source filters work this way. The use statement is compiled\n       and executed at compile time, before any more of the file is read, and\n       it attaches the cpp filter to the source stream behind the scenes. Now\n       the data flow looks like this:\n\n\t   cpp_test ----> cpp filter ----> parser\n\n       As the parser reads the second and subsequent lines from the source\n       stream, it feeds those lines through the \"cpp\" source filter before\n       processing them. The \"cpp\" filter simply passes each line through the\n       real C preprocessor. The output from the C preprocessor is then\n       inserted back into the source stream by the filter.\n\n\t\t\t .-> cpp --.\n\t\t\t |\t   |\n\t\t\t |\t   |\n\t\t\t |\t <-'\n\t  cpp_test ----> cpp filter ----> parser"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfilter`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe parser then sees the following code:\n\n\t   use Filter::cpp;\n\t   $a = 1;\n\t   print \"a = $a\\n\";\n\n       Let's consider what happens when the filtered code includes another\n       module with use:\n\n\t   1: use Filter::cpp;\n\t   2: #define TRUE 1\n\t   3: use Fred;\n\t   4: $a = TRUE;\n\t   5: print \"a = $a\\n\";\n\n       The \"cpp\" filter does not apply to the text of the Fred module, only to\n       the text of the file that used it (\"cpp_test\"). Although the use\n       statement on line 3 will pass through the cpp filter, the module that\n       gets included (\"Fred\") will not. The source streams look like this\n       after line 3 has been parsed and before line 4 is parsed:\n\n\t   cpp_test ---> cpp filter ---> parser (INACTIVE)\n\n\t   Fred.pm ----> parser\n\n       As you can see, a new stream has been created for reading the source\n       from \"Fred.pm\". This stream will remain active until all of \"Fred.pm\"\n       has been parsed. The source stream for \"cpp_test\" will still exist, but\n       is inactive. Once the parser has finished reading Fred.pm, the source\n       stream associated with it will be destroyed. The source stream for\n       \"cpp_test\" then becomes active again and the parser reads line 4 and\n       subsequent lines from \"cpp_test\"."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfilter`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nYou can use more than one source filter on a single file. Similarly,\n       you can reuse the same filter in as many files as you like.\n\n       For example, if you have a uuencoded and compressed source file, it is\n       possible to stack a uudecode filter and an uncompression filter like\n       this:\n\n\t   use Filter::uudecode; use Filter::uncompress;\n\t   M'XL(\".H<US4''V9I;F%L')Q;>7/;1I;_>_I3=&E=%:F*I\"T?22Q/\n\t   M6]9*<IQCO*XFT\"0[PL%%'Y+IG?WN^ZYN-$'J.[.JE$,20/?K=_[>\n\t   ...\n\n       Once the first line has been processed, the flow will look like this:\n\n\t   file ---> uudecode ---> uncompress ---> parser\n\t\t      filter\t     filter\n\n       Data flows through filters in the same order they appear in the source\n       file. The uudecode filter appeared before the uncompress filter, so the\n       source file will be uudecoded before it's uncompressed.\n\nWRITING A SOURCE FILTER\n       There are three ways to write your own source filter. You can write it\n       in C, use an external program as a filter, or write the filter in Perl.\n       I won't cover the first two in any great detail, so I'll get them out\n       of the way first. Writing the filter in Perl is most convenient, so\n       I'll devote the most space to it."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfilter`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nWRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN C\n       The first of the three available techniques is to write the filter\n       completely in C. The external module you create interfaces directly\n       with the source filter hooks provided by Perl.\n\n       The advantage of this technique is that you have complete control over\n       the implementation of your filter. The big disadvantage is the\n       increased complexity required to write the filter - not only do you\n       need to understand the source filter hooks, but you also need a\n       reasonable knowledge of Perl guts. One of the few times it is worth\n       going to this trouble is when writing a source scrambler. The \"decrypt\"\n       filter (which unscrambles the source before Perl parses it) included\n       with the source filter distribution is an example of a C source filter\n       (see Decryption Filters, below).\n\n       Decryption Filters\n\t    All decryption filters work on the principle of \"security through\n\t    obscurity.\" Regardless of how well you write a decryption filter\n\t    and how strong your encryption algorithm is, anyone determined\n\t    enough can retrieve the original source code. The reason is quite\n\t    simple - once the decryption filter has decrypted the source back\n\t    to its original form, fragments of it will be stored in the\n\t    computer's memory as Perl parses it. The source might only be in\n\t    memory for a short period of time, but anyone possessing a\n\t    debugger, skill, and lots of patience can eventually reconstruct\n\t    your program."

  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain how decryption filters work in the context of perlfilter and why they are considered insecure?

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfilter`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThat said, there are a number of steps that can be taken to make\n\t    life difficult for the potential cracker. The most important:\n\t    Write your decryption filter in C and statically link the\n\t    decryption module into the Perl binary. For further tips to make\n\t    life difficult for the potential cracker, see the file decrypt.pm\n\t    in the source filters distribution.\n\nCREATING A SOURCE FILTER AS A SEPARATE EXECUTABLE\n       An alternative to writing the filter in C is to create a separate\n       executable in the language of your choice. The separate executable\n       reads from standard input, does whatever processing is necessary, and\n       writes the filtered data to standard output. \"Filter::cpp\" is an\n       example of a source filter implemented as a separate executable - the\n       executable is the C preprocessor bundled with your C compiler.\n\n       The source filter distribution includes two modules that simplify this\n       task: \"Filter::exec\" and \"Filter::sh\". Both allow you to run any\n       external executable. Both use a coprocess to control the flow of data\n       into and out of the external executable. (For details on coprocesses,\n       see Stephens, W.R., \"Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment.\"\n       Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-210-56317-7, pages 441-445.) The difference\n       between them is that \"Filter::exec\" spawns the external command\n       directly, while \"Filter::sh\" spawns a shell to execute the external\n       command. (Unix uses the Bourne shell; NT uses the cmd shell.) Spawning\n       a shell allows you to make use of the shell metacharacters and\n       redirection facilities."

  manpageQuestion3: What is the difference between Filter::exec and Filter::sh in Perl?

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfilter`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nHere is an example script that uses \"Filter::sh\":\n\n\t   use Filter::sh 'tr XYZ PQR';\n\t   $a = 1;\n\t   print \"XYZ a = $a\\n\";\n\n       The output you'll get when the script is executed:\n\n\t   PQR a = 1\n\n       Writing a source filter as a separate executable works fine, but a\n       small performance penalty is incurred. For example, if you execute the\n       small example above, a separate subprocess will be created to run the\n       Unix \"tr\" command. Each use of the filter requires its own subprocess.\n       If creating subprocesses is expensive on your system, you might want to\n       consider one of the other options for creating source filters.\n\nWRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN PERL\n       The easiest and most portable option available for creating your own\n       source filter is to write it completely in Perl. To distinguish this\n       from the previous two techniques, I'll call it a Perl source filter.\n\n       To help understand how to write a Perl source filter we need an example\n       to study. Here is a complete source filter that performs rot13\n       decoding. (Rot13 is a very simple encryption scheme used in Usenet\n       postings to hide the contents of offensive posts. It moves every letter\n       forward thirteen places, so that A becomes N, B becomes O, and Z\n       becomes M.)"

The filter shown\n       above uses two of these functions, \"filter_add()\" and \"filter_read()\".\n\n       Next, we create the filter object and associate it with the source\n       stream by defining the \"import\" function. If you know Perl well enough,\n       you know that \"import\" is called automatically every time a module is\n       included with a use statement.

    Manpage text:

    In the example filter, the object ($ref) is blessed just like any other
           Perl object. Our example uses an anonymous array, but this isn't a
           requirement. Because this example doesn't need to store any context
           information, we could have used a scalar or hash reference just as
           well. The next section demonstrates context data.

           The association between the filter object and the source stream is made
           with the "filter_add()" function. This takes a filter object as a
           parameter ($ref in this case) and installs it in the source stream.

           Finally, there is the code that actually does the filtering. For this
           type of Perl source filter, all the filtering is done in a method
           called "filter()". (It is also possible to write a Perl source filter
           using a closure. See the "Filter::Util::Call" manual page for more
           details.) It's called every time the Perl parser needs another line of
           source to process. The "filter()" method, in turn, reads lines from the
           source stream using the "filter_read()" function.

A status\n       value of zero indicates end-of-file, less than zero means an error. The\n       filter function itself is expected to return its status in the same\n       way, and put the filtered line it wants written to the source stream in\n       $_.

Here's another demonstration\n       that shows off a few more features.\n\n       Say you wanted to include a lot of debugging code in your Perl script\n       during development, but you didn't want it available in the released\n       product. Source filters offer a solution. In order to keep the example\n       simple, let's say you wanted the debugging output to be controlled by\n       an environment variable, \"DEBUG\". Debugging code is enabled if the\n       variable exists, otherwise it is disabled.\n\n       Two special marker lines will bracket debugging code, like this:\n\n\t   ## DEBUG_BEGIN\n\t   if ($year > 1999) {\n\t      warn \"Debug: millennium bug in year $year\\n\";\n\t   }\n\t   ## DEBUG_END\n\n       The filter ensures that Perl parses the code between the <DEBUG_BEGIN>\n       and \"DEBUG_END\" markers only when the \"DEBUG\" environment variable\n       exists. That means that when \"DEBUG\" does exist, the code above should\n       be passed through the filter unchanged. The marker lines can also be\n       passed through as-is, because the Perl parser will see them as comment\n       lines. When \"DEBUG\" isn't set, we need a way to disable the debug code.\n       A simple way to achieve that is to convert the lines between the two\n       markers into comments:"

All but two of the\n       hash fields are used for error reporting. The first of those two,\n       Enabled, is used by the filter to determine whether the debugging code\n       should be given to the Perl parser. The second, InTraceBlock, is true\n       when the filter has encountered a \"DEBUG_BEGIN\" line, but has not yet\n       encountered the following \"DEBUG_END\" line."

Rather than having debugging code that is all-or-\n       nothing, it would be much more useful to be able to control which\n       specific blocks of debugging code get included. Try extending the\n       syntax for debug blocks to allow each to be identified. The contents of\n       the \"DEBUG\" environment variable can then be used to control which\n       blocks get included.\n\n       Once you can identify individual blocks, try allowing them to be\n       nested. That isn't difficult either.\n\n       Here is an interesting idea that doesn't involve the Debug filter.\n       Currently Perl subroutines have fairly limited support for formal\n       parameter lists. You can specify the number of parameters and their\n       type, but you still have to manually take them out of the @_ array\n       yourself. Write a source filter that allows you to have a named\n       parameter list. Such a filter would turn this:\n\n\t   sub MySub ($first, $second, @rest) { ... }\n\n       into this:"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfilter`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nsub MySub($$@) {\n\t      my ($first) = shift;\n\t      my ($second) = shift;\n\t      my (@rest) = @_;\n\t      ...\n\t   }\n\n       Finally, if you feel like a real challenge, have a go at writing a\n       full-blown Perl macro preprocessor as a source filter. Borrow the\n       useful features from the C preprocessor and any other macro processors\n       you know. The tricky bit will be choosing how much knowledge of Perl's\n       syntax you want your filter to have.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n       Source filters only work on the string level, thus are highly limited\n       in its ability to change source code on the fly. It cannot detect\n       comments, quoted strings, heredocs, it is no replacement for a real\n       parser.\tThe only stable usage for source filters are encryption,\n       compression, or the byteloader, to translate binary code back to source\n       code.\n\n       See for example the limitations in Switch, which uses source filters,\n       and thus is does not work inside a string eval, the presence of regexes\n       with embedded newlines that are specified with raw \"/.../\" delimiters\n       and don't have a modifier \"//x\" are indistinguishable from code chunks\n       beginning with the division operator \"/\". As a workaround you must use\n       \"m/.../\" or \"m?...?\" for such patterns. Also, the presence of regexes\n       specified with raw \"?...?\" delimiters may cause mysterious errors. The\n       workaround is to use \"m?...?\" instead.  See\n       <https://metacpan.org/pod/Switch#LIMITATIONS>."
