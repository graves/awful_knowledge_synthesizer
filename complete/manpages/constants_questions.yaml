You can, of course, define this like:\n\n\t   variable radtodeg [expr {180.0/(4.0*atan(1.0))}]\n\n       and use the variable radtodeg whenever you need the conversion.\n\n       This has two drawbacks:\n\n       •      You need to remember the proper formula or value and that is\n\t      error-prone.\n\n       •      Especially with the use of mathematical functions like atan you\n\t      assume that they have been accurately implemented. This is\n\t      seldom or never the case and for each platform you can get\n\t      subtle differences.\n\n       Here is the way you can do it with the math::constants package:\n\n\t   package require math::constants\n\t   ::math::constants::constants radtodeg degtorad\n\n       which creates two variables, radtodeg and (its reciprocal) degtorad in\n       the calling namespace.\n\n       Constants that have been defined (their values are mostly taken from\n       mathematical tables with more precision than usually can be handled)\n       include:\n\n       •      basic constants like pi, e, gamma (Euler's constant)\n\n       •      derived values like ln(10) and sqrt(2)\n\n       •      purely numerical values such as 1/3 that are included for\n\t      convenience and for the fact that certain seemingly trivial\n\t      computations like:\n\n\t\t  set value [expr {3.0*$onethird}]\n\n\t      give exactly the value you expect (if IEEE arithmetic is\n\t      available).\n\nPROCEDURES\n       The package defines the following public procedures:\n\n       ::math::constants::constants args\n\t      Import the constants whose names are given as arguments"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the math::constants package?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the math::constants package to import the constants pi, e, and ln(10) into your Tcl script?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the math::constants::print-constants command to display all defined constants and their values?
