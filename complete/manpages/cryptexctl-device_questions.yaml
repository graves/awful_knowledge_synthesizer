This subcommand will, when\n     appropriate, trigger the pairing dialog on the connected device.\n\nOPTIONS\n     A list of actions which may be performed:\n\n     print    Print information about a connected device. This includes\n\t      information about the device name, UDID and various device\n\t      identifiers used for personalization (see cryptexctl-create(1)).\n\n     pair     Initiate pairing cryptexctl on this machine with a device. This\n\t      will trigger a pairing dialog on the device which must be\n\t      accepted before other cryptex operations, such as installation,\n\t      may be performed.\n\n\t      The pair action will return immediately if the device has\n\t      already been paired.\n\n     unpair   Remove the pairing between this machine and a device. Performing\n\t      future cryptex operations will require the device be paired\n\t      again."

These\n\t      devices may be connected via a physical cable or over the\n\t      network if remote lockdown is enabled.

This UDID value can be\n\t\t   retrieved from the list or print actions and provides a\n\t\t   convenient way to operate on a single device when multiple\n\t\t   devices are connected.\n\n\t\t   The magic value \"first\" will select the first discovered\n\t\t   device.  Note that this will select the first device\n\t\t   detected over the lockdown protocol. This may include\n\t\t   wireless devices and the ordering is not guaranteed.
