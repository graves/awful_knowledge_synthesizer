It is normally\n       used to convert names to IP addresses and vice versa. When no arguments\n       or options are given, host prints a short summary of its command line\n       arguments and options.\n\n       name is the domain name that is to be looked up. It can also be a\n       dotted-decimal IPv4 address or a colon-delimited IPv6 address, in which\n       case host will by default perform a reverse lookup for that address.\n       server is an optional argument which is either the name or IP address\n       of the name server that host should query instead of the server or\n       servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -4\n\t   Use IPv4 only for query transport. See also the -6 option.\n\n       -6\n\t   Use IPv6 only for query transport. See also the -4 option."

If you'd\n       like to turn off the IDN support for some reason, defines the\n       IDN_DISABLE environment variable. The IDN support is disabled if the\n       variable is set when host runs."
