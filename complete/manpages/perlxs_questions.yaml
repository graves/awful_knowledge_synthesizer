The XS interface is combined with the library to create\n       a new library which can then be either dynamically loaded or statically\n       linked into perl.  The XS interface description is written in the XS\n       language and is the core component of the Perl extension interface.\n\n       Before writing XS, read the \"CAVEATS\" section below.\n\n       An XSUB forms the basic unit of the XS interface.  After compilation by\n       the xsubpp compiler, each XSUB amounts to a C function definition which\n       will provide the glue between Perl calling conventions and C calling\n       conventions.\n\n       The glue code pulls the arguments from the Perl stack, converts these\n       Perl values to the formats expected by a C function, call this C\n       function, transfers the return values of the C function back to Perl.\n       Return values here may be a conventional C return value or any C\n       function arguments that may serve as output parameters.\tThese return\n       values may be passed back to Perl either by putting them on the Perl\n       stack, or by modifying the arguments supplied from the Perl side."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlxs`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe above is a somewhat simplified view of what really happens.\tSince\n       Perl allows more flexible calling conventions than C, XSUBs may do much\n       more in practice, such as checking input parameters for validity,\n       throwing exceptions (or returning undef/empty list) if the return value\n       from the C function indicates failure, calling different C functions\n       based on numbers and types of the arguments, providing an object-\n       oriented interface, etc.\n\n       Of course, one could write such glue code directly in C.  However, this\n       would be a tedious task, especially if one needs to write glue for\n       multiple C functions, and/or one is not familiar enough with the Perl\n       stack discipline and other such arcana.\tXS comes to the rescue here:\n       instead of writing this glue C code in long-hand, one can write a more\n       concise short-hand description of what should be done by the glue, and\n       let the XS compiler xsubpp handle the rest.\n\n       The XS language allows one to describe the mapping between how the C\n       routine is used, and how the corresponding Perl routine is used.  It\n       also allows creation of Perl routines which are directly translated to\n       C code and which are not related to a pre-existing C function.  In\n       cases when the C interface coincides with the Perl interface, the XSUB\n       declaration is almost identical to a declaration of a C function (in\n       K&R style).  In such circumstances, there is another tool called \"h2xs\"\n       that is able to translate an entire C header file into a corresponding\n       XS file that will provide glue to the functions/macros described in the\n       header file."

    If the XSUB has a return type of "void" then the compiler will not
           declare a RETVAL variable for that function.  When using a PPCODE:
           section no manipulation of the RETVAL variable is required, the section
           may use direct stack manipulation to place output values on the stack.

           If PPCODE: directive is not used, "void" return value should be used
           only for subroutines which do not return a value, even if CODE:
           directive is used which sets ST(0) explicitly.

           Older versions of this document recommended to use "void" return value
           in such cases. It was discovered that this could lead to segfaults in
           cases when XSUB was truly "void". This practice is now deprecated, and
           may be not supported at some future version. Use the return value "SV

           The OUTPUT: keyword indicates that certain function parameters should
           be updated (new values made visible to Perl) when the XSUB terminates
           or that certain values should be returned to the calling Perl function.
           For simple functions which have no CODE: or PPCODE: section, such as
           the sin() function above, the RETVAL variable is automatically
           designated as an output value.  For more complex functions the xsubpp
           compiler will need help to determine which variables are output
           variables.

           This keyword will normally be used to complement the CODE: keyword.
           The RETVAL variable is not recognized as an output variable when the
           CODE: keyword is present.  The OUTPUT: keyword is used in this
           situation to tell the compiler that RETVAL really is an output
           variable.

           The OUTPUT: keyword can also be used to indicate that function
           parameters are output variables.  This may be necessary when a
           parameter has been modified within the function and the programmer
           would like the update to be seen by Perl.

    The actual difference between PPCODE: and CODE: sections is in the
           initialization of "SP" macro (which stands for the current Perl stack
           pointer), and in the handling of data on the stack when returning from
           an XSUB.  In CODE: sections SP preserves the value which was on entry
           to the XSUB: SP is on the function pointer (which follows the last
           parameter).  In PPCODE: sections SP is moved backward to the beginning
           of the parameter list, which allows "PUSH*()" macros to place output
           values in the place Perl expects them to be when the XSUB returns back
           to Perl.

           The generated trailer for a CODE: section ensures that the number of
           return values Perl will see is either 0 or 1 (depending on the
           "void"ness of the return value of the C function, and heuristics
           mentioned in "The RETVAL Variable").  The trailer generated for a
           PPCODE: section is based on the number of return values and on the
           number of times "SP" was updated by "[X]PUSH*()" macros.

    REQUIRE: 1.922

       The CLEANUP: Keyword
           This keyword can be used when an XSUB requires special cleanup
           procedures before it terminates.  When the CLEANUP: keyword is used it
           must follow any CODE:, or OUTPUT: blocks which are present in the XSUB.
           The code specified for the cleanup block will be added as the last
           statements in the XSUB.

       The POSTCALL: Keyword
           This keyword can be used when an XSUB requires special procedures
           executed after the C subroutine call is performed.  When the POSTCALL:
           keyword is used it must precede OUTPUT: and CLEANUP: blocks which are
           present in the XSUB.

           See examples in "The NO_OUTPUT Keyword" and "Returning Undef And Empty
           Lists".

           The POSTCALL: block does not make a lot of sense when the C subroutine
           call is supplied by user by providing either CODE: or PPCODE: section.

       The BOOT: Keyword
           The BOOT: keyword is used to add code to the extension's bootstrap
           function.  The bootstrap function is generated by the xsubpp compiler
           and normally holds the statements necessary to register any XSUBs with
           Perl.  With the BOOT: keyword the programmer can tell the compiler to

    Manpage text:

    If the same C type is used in several different contexts which require
           different translations, "typedef" several new types mapped to this C
           type, and create separate typemap entries for these new types.  Use
           these types in declarations of return type and parameters to XSUBs.

       Perl Objects And C Structures
           When dealing with C structures one should select either T_PTROBJ or
           T_PTRREF for the XS type.  Both types are designed to handle pointers
           to complex objects.  The T_PTRREF type will allow the Perl object to be
           unblessed while the T_PTROBJ type requires that the object be blessed.
           By using T_PTROBJ one can achieve a form of type-checking because the
           XSUB will attempt to verify that the Perl object is of the expected
           type.

           The following XS code shows the getnetconfigent() function which is
           used with ONC+ TIRPC.  The getnetconfigent() function will return a
           pointer to a C structure and has the C prototype shown below.  The
           example will demonstrate how the C pointer will become a Perl
           reference.  Perl will consider this reference to be a pointer to a
           blessed object and will attempt to call a destructor for the object.  A
           destructor will be provided in the XS source to free the memory used by
           getnetconfigent().  Destructors in XS can be created by specifying an
           XSUB function whose name ends with the word DESTROY.  XS destructors
           can be used to free memory which may have been malloc'd by another
           XSUB.

XS code is viewed as a help-\n       mate, to accomplish things that perl doesn't do, or doesn't do fast\n       enough, but always subservient to perl.\tThe closer XS code adheres to\n       this model, the less likely conflicts will occur.\n\n       One area where there has been conflict is in regards to C locales.\n       (See perllocale.)  perl, with one exception and unless told otherwise,\n       sets up the underlying locale the program is running in to the locale\n       passed into it from the environment.  This is an important difference\n       from a generic C language program, where the underlying locale is the\n       \"C\" locale unless the program changes it.  As of v5.20, this underlying\n       locale is completely hidden from pure Perl code outside the lexical\n       scope of \"use locale\" except for a couple of function calls in the\n       POSIX module which of necessity use it.\tBut the underlying locale,\n       with that one exception is exposed to XS code, affecting all C library\n       routines whose behavior is locale-dependent.  Your XS code better not\n       assume that the underlying locale is \"C\".  The exception is the\n       \"LC_NUMERIC\" locale category, and the reason it is an exception is that\n       experience has shown that it can be problematic for XS code, whereas we\n       have not had reports of problems with the other locale categories.  And\n       the reason for this one category being problematic is that the\n       character used as a decimal point can vary.  Many European languages\n       use a comma, whereas English, and hence Perl are expecting a dot\n       (U+002E: FULL STOP).  Many modules can handle only the radix character\n       being a dot, and so perl attempts to make it so.  Up through Perl\n       v5.20, the attempt was merely to set \"LC_NUMERIC\" upon startup to the\n       \"C\" locale.  Any setlocale() otherwise would change it; this caused\n       some failures.  Therefore, starting in v5.22, perl tries to keep\n       \"LC_NUMERIC\" always set to \"C\" for XS code."

If you don't allow for a non-dot,\n\t   your code could break if anyone anywhere changed the locale.  For\n\t   this reason, v5.22 changed the behavior so that Perl tries to keep\n\t   \"LC_NUMERIC\" in the \"C\" locale except around the operations\n\t   internally where it should be something else.  Misbehaving XS code\n\t   will always be able to change the locale anyway, but the most\n\t   common instance of this is checked for and handled."

Perl makes this transparent to perl-\n\t   space code.\tIt continues to use \"POSIX::setlocale()\", and the\n\t   interpreter translates that into the per-thread functions.\n\n\t   All other locale-sensitive functions automatically use the per-\n\t   thread locale, if that is turned on, and failing that, the global\n\t   locale.  Thus calls to \"setlocale\" are ineffective on POSIX systems\n\t   for the current thread if that thread is using a per-thread locale.\n\t   If perl is compiled for single-thread operation, it does not use\n\t   the per-thread functions, so \"setlocale\" does work as expected."
