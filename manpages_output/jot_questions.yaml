Octal,\n\t     hexadecimal, exponential, ASCII, zero padded, and right-adjusted\n\t     representations are possible by using the appropriate printf(3)\n\t     conversion specification inside word, in which case the data are\n\t     inserted rather than appended.\n\n     -c      This is an abbreviation for -w %c.\n\n     -s string\n\t     Print data separated by string.  Normally, newlines separate\n\t     data.\n\n     -n      Do not print the final newline normally appended to the output."

While at least one of them must appear, any of the other three may\n     be omitted, and will be considered as such if given as - or as an empty\n     string.  Any three of these arguments determines the fourth.  If four are\n     specified and the given and computed values of reps conflict, the lower\n     value is used.  If one or two are specified, defaults are assigned\n     starting with s, which assumes a default of 1 (or -1 if begin and end\n     specify a descending range).  Then the default values are assigned to the\n     leftmost omitted arguments until three arguments are set."

When jot is asked\n     to generate random integers or characters with begin and end values in\n     the range of the random number generator function and no format is\n     specified with one of the -w, -b, or -p options, jot will arrange for all\n     the values in the range to appear in the output with an equal\n     probability.  In all other cases be careful to ensure that the output\n     format's rounding or truncation will not skew the distribution of output\n     values in an unintended way."

Before printing a number, it is converted depending on the\n     output format used.\n\n     If no output format is specified or the output format is a floating point\n     format (‘E’, ‘G’, ‘e’, ‘f’, or ‘g’), the value is rounded using the\n     printf(3) function, taking into account the requested precision.\n\n     If the output format is an integer format (‘D’, ‘O’, ‘U’, ‘X’, ‘c’, ‘d’,\n     ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’, or ‘x’), the value is converted to an integer value by\n     truncation.\n\n     As an illustration, consider the following command:\n\n\t   $ jot 6 1 10 0.5\n\t   1\n\t   2\n\t   2\n\t   2\n\t   3\n\t   4\n\n     By requesting an explicit precision of 1, the values generated before\n     rounding can be seen.
