The main\n       concepts are described below.  The basic idea is to separate, to the\n       extent possible, the code implementing a widget's behavior from the\n       code implementing its appearance.  Widget class bindings are primarily\n       responsible for maintaining the widget state and invoking callbacks;\n       all aspects of the widget's appearance are controlled by the style of\n       the widget (i.e. the style of the elements of the widget).\n\nTHEMES\n       A theme is a collection of elements and styles that determine the look\n       and feel of the widget set.  Themes can be used to:"

For example, a\n       vertical scrollbar widget contains uparrow, downarrow, trough and\n       slider elements.\n\n       Element names use a recursive dotted notation.  For example, uparrow\n       identifies a generic arrow element, and Scrollbar.uparrow and\n       Combobox.uparrow identify widget-specific elements.  When looking for\n       an element, the style engine looks for the specific name first, and if\n       an element of that name is not found it looks for generic elements by\n       stripping off successive leading components of the element name."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `ttk::intro`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nLike widgets, elements have options which specify what to display and\n       how to display it.  For example, the text element (which displays a\n       text string) has -text, -font, -foreground, -background, -underline,\n       and -width options.  The value of an element option is taken from:\n\n       •      an option of the same name and type in the widget containing the\n\t      element;\n\n       •      a dynamic setting specified by style map and the current state;\n\n       •      the default setting specified by style configure; or\n\n       •      the element's built-in default value for the option.\n\nLAYOUTS\n       A layout specifies which elements make up a widget and how they are\n       arranged.  The layout engine uses a simplified version of the pack\n       algorithm: starting with an initial cavity equal to the size of the\n       widget, elements are allocated a parcel within the cavity along the\n       side specified by the -side option, and placed within the parcel\n       according to the -sticky option.  For example, the layout for a\n       horizontal scrollbar is:"

Some widgets support additional states,\n       such as the entry widget which has a readonly state and the various\n       flavors of buttons which have active state.\n\n       The themed Tk widgets generalizes this idea: every widget has a bitmap\n       of independent state flags.  Widget state flags include active,\n       disabled, pressed, focus, etc., (see ttk::widget(n) for the full list\n       of state flags).\n\n       Instead of a -state option, every widget now has a state widget command\n       which is used to set or query the state.  A state specification is a\n       list of symbolic state names indicating which bits are set, each\n       optionally prefixed with an exclamation point indicating that the bit\n       is cleared instead."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `ttk::intro`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nFor example, the class bindings for the ttk::button widget are:\n\n\t      bind TButton <Enter>{ %W state active }\n\t      bind TButton <Leave>{ %W state !active }\n\t      bind TButton <ButtonPress-1>{ %W state pressed }\n\t      bind TButton <Button1-Leave>{ %W state !pressed }\n\t      bind TButton <Button1-Enter>{ %W state pressed }\n\t      bind TButton <ButtonRelease-1>\\\n\t\t  { %W instate {pressed} { %W state !pressed ; %W invoke } }\n\n       This specifies that the widget becomes active when the pointer enters\n       the widget, and inactive when it leaves.  Similarly it becomes pressed\n       when the mouse button is pressed, and !pressed on the ButtonRelease\n       event.  In addition, the button unpresses if pointer is dragged outside\n       the widget while Button-1 is held down, and represses if it's dragged\n       back in.  Finally, when the mouse button is released, the widget's\n       -command is invoked, but only if the button is currently in the pressed\n       state.  (The actual bindings are a little more complicated than the\n       above, but not by much)."

Style names use a recursive dotted notation like\n       layouts and elements; by default, widgets use the class name to look up\n       a style in the current theme.
