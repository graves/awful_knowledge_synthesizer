If no application name is specified, the\n     default application as determined via LaunchServices is used to open the\n     specified files.\n\n     If the file is in the form of a URL, the file will be opened as a URL.\n\n     You can specify one or more file names (or pathnames), which are\n     interpreted relative to the shell or Terminal window's current working\n     directory. For example, the following command would open all Word files\n     in the current working directory:\n\n     open *.doc\n\n     Opened applications inherit environment variables just as if you had\n     launched the application directly through its full path.  This behavior\n     was also present in Tiger."
