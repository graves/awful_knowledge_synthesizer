This information can be used\n       to defend against clients that hammer a server with either too many\n       simultaneous sessions, or with too many successive requests within a\n       configurable time interval.  This server is designed to run under\n       control by the Postfix master(8) server.\n\n       In the following text, ident specifies a (service, client) combination.\n       The exact syntax of that information is application-dependent; the\n       anvil(8) server does not care.\n\nCONNECTION COUNT/RATE CONTROL\n       To register a new connection send the following request to the anvil(8)\n       server:\n\n\t   request=connect\n\t   ident=string\n\n       The anvil(8) server answers with the number of simultaneous connections\n       and the number of connections per unit time for the (service, client)\n       combination specified with ident:\n\n\t   status=0\n\t   count=number\n\t   rate=number\n\n       To register a disconnect event send the following request to the\n       anvil(8) server:\n\n\t   request=disconnect\n\t   ident=string\n\n       The anvil(8) server replies with:\n\n\t   status=0\n\nMESSAGE RATE CONTROL\n       To register a message delivery request send the following request to\n       the anvil(8) server:\n\n\t   request=message\n\t   ident=string\n\n       The anvil(8) server answers with the number of message delivery\n       requests per unit time for the (service, client) combination specified\n       with ident:\n\n\t   status=0\n\t   rate=number\n\nRECIPIENT RATE CONTROL\n       To register a recipient request send the following request to the\n       anvil(8) server:\n\n\t   request=recipient\n\t   ident=string\n\n       The anvil(8) server answers with the number of recipient addresses per\n       unit time for the (service, client) combination specified with ident:\n\n\t   status=0\n\t   rate=number\n\nTLS SESSION NEGOTIATION RATE CONTROL\n       The features described in this section are available with Postfix 2.3\n       and later.\n\n       To register a request for a new (i.e. not cached) TLS session send the\n       following request to the anvil(8) server:\n\n\t   request=newtls\n\t   ident=string\n\n       The anvil(8) server answers with the number of new TLS session requests\n       per unit time for the (service, client) combination specified with\n       ident:\n\n\t   status=0\n\t   rate=number\n\n       To retrieve new TLS session request rate information without updating\n       the counter information, send:\n\n\t   request=newtls_report\n\t   ident=string\n\n       The anvil(8) server answers with the number of new TLS session requests\n       per unit time for the (service, client) combination specified with\n       ident:\n\n\t   status=0\n\t   rate=number\n\nAUTH RATE CONTROL\n       To register an AUTH request send the following request to the anvil(8)\n       server:\n\n\t   request=auth\n\t   ident=string\n\n       The anvil(8) server answers with the number of auth requests per unit\n       time for the (service, client) combination specified with ident:\n\n\t   status=0\n\t   rate=number\n\nSECURITY\n       The anvil(8) server does not talk to the network or to local users, and\n       can run chrooted at fixed low privilege.\n\n       The anvil(8) server maintains an in-memory table with information about\n       recent clients requests.  No persistent state is kept because standard\n       system library routines are not sufficiently robust for\n       update-intensive applications.\n\n       Although the in-memory state is kept only temporarily, this may require\n       a lot of memory on systems that handle connections from many remote\n       clients.  To reduce memory usage, reduce the time unit over which state\n       is kept.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).\n\n       Upon exit, and every anvil_status_update_time seconds, the server logs\n       the maximal count and rate values measured, together with (service,\n       client) information and the time of day associated with those events.\n       In order to avoid unnecessary overhead, no measurements are done for\n       activity that isn't concurrency limited or rate limited.\n\nBUGS\n       Systems behind network address translating routers or proxies appear to\n       have the same client address and can run into connection count and/or\n       rate limits falsely.\n\n       In this preliminary implementation, a count (or rate) limited server\n       process can have only one remote client at a time. If a server process\n       reports multiple simultaneous clients, state is kept only for the last\n       reported client.\n\n       The anvil(8) server automatically discards client request information\n       after it expires.  To prevent the anvil(8) server from discarding\n       client request rate information too early or too late, a rate limited\n       service should always register connect/disconnect events even when it\n       does not explicitly limit them.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       On low-traffic mail systems, changes to main.cf are picked up\n       automatically as anvil(8) processes run for only a limited amount of\n       time. On other mail systems, use the command \"postfix reload\" to speed\n       up a change.\n\n       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for\n       more details including examples.\n\n       anvil_rate_time_unit (60s)\n\t      The time unit over which client connection rates and other rates\n\t      are calculated.\n\n       anvil_status_update_time (600s)\n\t      How frequently the anvil(8) connection and rate limiting server\n\t      logs peak usage information.\n\n       config_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf\n\t      configuration files.\n\n       daemon_timeout (18000s)\n\t      How much time a Postfix daemon process may take to handle a\n\t      request before it is terminated by a built-in watchdog timer.\n\n       ipc_timeout (3600s)\n\t      The time limit for sending or receiving information over an\n\t      internal communication channel.\n\n       max_idle (100s)\n\t      The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix daemon process\n\t      waits for an incoming connection before terminating voluntarily.\n\n       max_use (100)\n\t      The maximal number of incoming connections that a Postfix daemon\n\t      process will service before terminating voluntarily.\n\n       process_id (read-only)\n\t      The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.\n\n       process_name (read-only)\n\t      The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.\n\n       syslog_facility (mail)\n\t      The syslog facility of Postfix logging.\n\n       syslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      A prefix that is prepended to the process name in syslog\n\t      records, so that, for example, \"smtpd\" becomes \"prefix/smtpd\".\n\nSEE ALSO\n       smtpd(8), Postfix SMTP server\n       postconf(5), configuration parameters\n       master(5), generic daemon options\n\nREADME FILES\n       Use \"postconf readme_directory\" or \"postconf html_directory\" to locate\n       this information.\n       TUNING_README, performance tuning\n\nLICENSE\n       The Secure Mailer license must be distributed with this software.\n\nHISTORY\n       The anvil service is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n       Wietse Venema\n       IBM T.J.
