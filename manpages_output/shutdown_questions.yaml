The -k option does not actually halt the\n\t     system, but leaves the system multi-user with logins disabled\n\t     (for all but super-user).\n\n     -o      If one of the -h or -r options are specified, shutdown will\n\t     execute halt(8) or reboot(8) instead of sending a signal to\n\t     launchd(8)."

The first form brings the system down\n\t     in number minutes and the second at the absolute time specified.\n\t     +number may be specified in units other than minutes by appending\n\t     the corresponding suffix: “s”, “sec”, “m”, “min”, “h”, “hour”.\n\n\t     If an absolute time is specified, but not a date, and that time\n\t     today has already passed, shutdown will assume that the same time\n\t     tomorrow was meant.  (If a complete date is specified which has\n\t     already passed, shutdown will print an error and exit without\n\t     shutting the system down.)"

Five minutes before shutdown, or\n     immediately if shutdown is in less than 5 minutes, logins are disabled by\n     creating /var/run/nologin and copying the warning message there.  If this\n     file exists when a user attempts to log in, login(1) prints its contents\n     and exits.  The file is removed just before shutdown exits.\n\n     At shutdown time a message is written to the system log, containing the\n     time of shutdown, the person who initiated the shutdown and the reason.\n     The corresponding signal is then sent to launchd(8) to respectively halt,\n     reboot or bring the system down to single-user state (depending on the\n     above options).  The time of the shutdown and the warning message are\n     placed in /var/run/nologin and should be used to inform the users about\n     when the system will be back up and why it is going down (or anything\n     else)."
