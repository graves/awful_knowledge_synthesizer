Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `nice`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nNICE(1) \t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t       NICE(1)\n\nNAME\n     nice – execute a utility at an altered scheduling priority\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     nice [-n increment] utility [argument ...]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The nice utility runs utility at an altered scheduling priority, by\n     incrementing its “nice” value by the specified increment, or a default\n     value of 10.  The lower the nice value of a process, the higher its\n     scheduling priority.\n\n     The superuser may specify a negative increment in order to run a utility\n     with a higher scheduling priority.\n\n     Some shells may provide a builtin nice command which is similar or\n     identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n     The PATH environment variable is used to locate the requested utility if\n     the name contains no ‘/’ characters.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     If utility is invoked, the exit status of nice is the exit status of\n     utility.\n\n     An exit status of 126 indicates utility was found, but could not be\n     executed.\tAn exit status of 127 indicates utility could not be found."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the `nice` command?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the `nice` command to run a script with a scheduling priority that is 5 levels higher than the default?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using `nice` to execute a utility with a negative increment, thereby increasing its scheduling priority?
