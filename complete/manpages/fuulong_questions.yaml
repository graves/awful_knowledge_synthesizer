This\n\t\tfunction is safe to call during an interrupt context.\n\n     fuiword()\tFetches a word of data from the user-space address addr.  This\n\t\tfunction is safe to call during an interrupt context."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the fetch, fubyte, fuibyte, fuiword, fulong, fuulong, and fuword functions?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the fuulong function to retrieve a 64-bit unsigned integer from a user-space address?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain how the fuibyte function differs from the fubyte function in terms of their usage and safety context?
