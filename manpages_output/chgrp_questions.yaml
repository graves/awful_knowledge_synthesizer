Use -h to change the group ID of a symbolic\n\t     link.\n\n     -R      Change the group ID of the file hierarchies rooted in the files,\n\t     instead of just the files themselves.  Beware of unintentionally\n\t     matching the “..” hard link to the parent directory when using\n\t     wildcards like “.*”."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the chgrp command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use chgrp to change the group of all files and subdirectories in a directory, including those inside nested directories, without following symbolic links?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using chgrp with the -R and -P options to change the group of all files in a directory tree, ensuring that symbolic links are not followed and the group ID is set for each file?

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use chgrp to change the group of a file without prompting for confirmation and while ensuring that symbolic links are handled by their own group IDs?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using chgrp to change the group of a file to a numeric group ID, while also showing the old and new group IDs in verbose mode?
