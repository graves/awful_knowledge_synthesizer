This is done for all lines in the string, that is any\n\t      substring between 2 newline chars, or between the beginning of\n\t      the string and a newline, or between a newline and the end of\n\t      the string, or, if the string contain no newline, between the\n\t      beginning and the end of the string.  The regular expression\n\t      regexp defaults to \"[ \\\\t]+\"."
