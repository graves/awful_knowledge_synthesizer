This function will not\n       read or write to characters outside that size.\n\n       The  flags are one of Stringprep_profile_flags values, or 0.\n\n       The  profile contain the Stringprep_profile instructions to perform.\n       Your application can define new profiles, possibly re-using the generic\n       stringprep tables that always will be part of the library, or use one\n       of the currently supported profiles.\n\n       Return value: Returns STRINGPREP_OK iff successful, or an error code.\n\nREPORTING BUGS\n       Report bugs to <help-libidn@gnu.org>.\n       General guidelines for reporting bugs: https://www.gnu.org/gethelp/\n       GNU Libidn home page: https://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/"
