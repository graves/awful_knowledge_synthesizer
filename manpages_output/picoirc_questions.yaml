All communication with the parent\n       application is done via an application provided callback procedure.\n       Each connection has its own state so you can hook up multiple servers\n       in a single application instance.\n\n       To initiate an IRC connection you must call picoirc::connect with a\n       callback procedure, a nick-name to use on IRC and the IRC URL that\n       describes the connection. This will return a variable name that is the\n       irc connection context. See CALLBACK for details."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `picoirc`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThis package is a fairly simple IRC client. If you need something with\n       more capability investigate the irc package.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::picoirc::connect callback nick url\n\t      Create a new irc connection to the server specified by url and\n\t      login using the nick as the username. The callback must be as\n\t      specified in CALLBACK. Returns a package-specific variable that\n\t      is used when calling other commands in this package.\n\n       ::picoirc::post context channel message\n\t      This should be called to process user input and send it to the\n\t      server. A number of commands are recognised when prefixed with a\n\t      forward-slash (/). Such commands are converted to IRC command\n\t      sequences and then sent.\n\n       ::picoirc::splituri uri\n\t      Splits an IRC scheme uniform resource indicator into its\n\t      component parts. Returns a list of server, port and channel. The\n\t      default port is 6667 and there is no default channel.\n\n       ::picoirc::send context line\n\t      This command is where all raw output to the server is handled.\n\t      The default action is to write the line to the irc socket.\n\t      However, before this happens the callback is called with \"debug\n\t      write\". This permits the application author to inspect the raw\n\t      IRC data and if desired to return a break error code to halt\n\t      further processing. In this way the application can override the\n\t      default send via the callback procedure."

If an error occurs before we get connected the only\n\t      argument will be the socket error message.\n\n       userlist channel nicklist\n\t      called to notify the application of an updated userlist. This is\n\t      generated when the output of the NAMES irc command is seen. The\n\t      package collects the entire output which can span a number of\n\t      output lines from the server and calls this callback when they\n\t      have all been received.\n\n       chat target nick message type\n\t      called when a message arrives. target is the identity that the\n\t      message was targetted for. This can be the logged in nick or a\n\t      channel name. nick is the name of the sender of the message.\n\t      message is the message text. type is set to \"ACTION\" if the\n\t      message was sent as a CTCP ACTION"
