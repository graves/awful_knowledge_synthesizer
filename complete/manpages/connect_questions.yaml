If the socket is of type\n     SOCK_STREAM, this call attempts to make a connection to another socket.\n     The other socket is specified by address, which is an address in the\n     communications space of the socket.\n\n     Each communications space interprets the address parameter in its own\n     way.  Generally, stream sockets may successfully connect() only once;\n     datagram sockets may use connect() multiple times to change their\n     association.  Datagram sockets may dissolve the association by calling\n     disconnectx(2), or by connecting to an invalid address, such as a null\n     address or an address with the address family set to AF_UNSPEC (the error\n     EAFNOSUPPORT will be harmlessly returned)."
