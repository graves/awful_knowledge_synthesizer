    Manpage text:

    The size of the virtual memory region represents the virtual memory pages
         reserved, but not necessarily allocated.  For example, using the
         vm_allocate Mach system call reserves the pages, but physical memory
         won't be allocated for the page until the memory is actually touched.  A
         memory-mapped file may have a virtual memory page reserved, but the pages
         are not instantiated until a read or write happens.  Thus, this size may
         not correctly describe the application's true memory usage.

         By default, the sizes are shown in kilobytes or megabytes.  If the -pages
         flag is given, then the sizes are in number of VM pages.

         The protection mode describes if the memory is readable, writable, or
         executable.  Each virtual memory region has a current permission, and a
         maximum permission.  In the line for a virtual memory region, the current
         permission is displayed first, the maximum permission second.  For
         example, the first page of an application (starting at address
         0x00000000) permits neither reads, writes, or execution ("---"), ensuring
         that any reads or writes to address 0, or dereferences of a NULL pointer
         immediately cause a bus error.  Pages representing an executable always
         have the execute and read bits set ("r-x").  The current permissions
         usually do not permit writing to the region.  However, the maximum
         permissions allow writing so that the debugger can request write access
         to a page to insert breakpoints.  Permissions for executables appear as
         "r-x/rwx" to indicate these permissions.

    Manpage text:

    % FRAG = 100 - (100 * Allocated / (Dirty + Swapped))

         Dirty and swapped are memory which has been written to by the process.
         Allocated is the number of bytes currently allocated from malloc.

    SEE ALSO
         heap(1), leaks(1), malloc_history(1), stringdups(1), lsof(8)

         The heap, leaks, and malloc_history commands can be used to look at
         various aspects of a process's memory usage.

         The lsof command can be used to get a list of open and mapped files in
         one or more processes, which can help determine why a volume can't be
         unmounted or ejected, for example.

         The Xcode developer tools also include Instruments, a graphical
         application that can give information similar to that provided by vmmap.
         The Allocations instrument graphically displays dynamic, real-time
         information about the object and memory use in an application (including
         VM allocations), as well as backtraces of where the allocations occurred.
         The VM Tracker instrument in the Allocations template graphically
         displays information about the virtual memory regions in a process.
