The procedures\n       that create a plot use the entire canvas window, making the layout of\n       the plot completely automatic.\n\n       This results in the creation of an xy-plot in, say, ten lines of code:"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `plotchart`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\npackage require Plotchart\n\n\t   canvas .c -background white -width 400 -height 200\n\t   pack   .c -fill both\n\n\t   #\n\t   # Create the plot with its x- and y-axes\n\t   #\n\t   set s [::Plotchart::createXYPlot .c {0.0 100.0 10.0} {0.0 100.0 20.0}]\n\n\t   foreach {x y} {0.0 32.0 10.0 50.0 25.0 60.0 78.0 11.0 } {\n\t       $s plot series1 $x $y\n\t   }\n\n\t   $s title \"Data series\"\n\n\n       A drawback of the package might be that it does not do any data\n       management. So if the canvas that holds the plot is to be resized, the\n       whole plot must be redrawn.  The advantage, though, is that it offers a\n       number of plot and chart types:\n\n       •      XY-plots like the one shown above with any number of data\n\t      series.\n\n       •      Stripcharts, a kind of XY-plots where the horizontal axis is\n\t      adjusted automatically. The result is a kind of sliding window\n\t      on the data series.\n\n       •      Polar plots, where the coordinates are polar instead of\n\t      cartesian.\n\n       •      Histograms, for plotting statistical information.\n\n       •      Isometric plots, where the scale of the coordinates in the two\n\t      directions is always the same, i.e. a circle in world\n\t      coordinates appears as a circle on the screen.\n\n\t      You can zoom in and out, as well as pan with these plots (Note:\n\t      this works best if no axes are drawn, the zooming and panning\n\t      routines do not distinguish the axes), using the mouse buttons\n\t      with the control key and the arrow keys with the control key.\n\n       •      Piecharts, with automatic scaling to indicate the proportions.\n\n       •      Barcharts, with either vertical or horizontal bars, stacked bars\n\t      or bars side by side.\n\n       •      Timecharts, where bars indicate a time period and milestones or\n\t      other important moments in time are represented by triangles.\n\n       •      3D plots (both for displaying surfaces and 3D bars)\n\n       With version 1.5 a new command has been introduced: plotconfig, which\n       can be used to configure the plot options for particular types of plots\n       and charts (cf. CONFIGURATION OPTIONS) With version 1.8.3 several new\n       features were introduced, which allow more interactivity (cf.\n       INTERACTIVE USE)\n\nPLOT CREATION COMMANDS\n       You create the plot or chart with one single command and then fill the\n       plot with data:\n\n       ::Plotchart::createXYPlot w xaxis yaxis\n\t      Create a new xy-plot (configuration type: xyplot).\n\n\t      widget w (in)\n\t\t     Name of the existing canvas widget to hold the plot.\n\n\t      list xaxis (in)\n\t\t     A 3-element list containing minimum, maximum and stepsize\n\t\t     for the x-axis, in this order.  For an inverted axis,\n\t\t     where the maximum appears on the left-hand side, use:\n\t\t     maximum, minimum and a negative stepsize.\n\n\t      list yaxis (in)\n\t\t     A 3-element list containing minimum, maximum and stepsize\n\t\t     for the y-axis, in this order.  For an inverted axis,\n\t\t     where the maximum appears at the bottom, use: maximum,\n\t\t     minimum and a negative stepsize."

Defaults to 0 (the axis will be from\n\t\t     minimum to maximum)\n\nMISSING VALUES\n       Often data that need to be plotted contain gaps - in a series of\n       measurement data, they can occur because the equipment failed, a sample\n       was not collected correctly or for many other reasons. The Plotchart\n       handles these gaps by assuming that one or both coordinates of such\n       data points are an empty string:\n\n\t   #\n\t   # Create the plot with its x- and y-axes\n\t   #\n\t   set s [::Plotchart::createXYPlot .c {0.0 100.0 10.0} {0.0 100.0 20.0}]\n\n\t   foreach {x y} {0.0 32.0 10.0 {} 25.0 60.0 78.0 11.0 } {\n\t       $s plot series1 $x $y\n\t   }\n\n       The effect varies according to the type of plot:\n\n       •      For xy-plots, radial plots and strip charts the missing data\n\t      point causes a gap in the line through the points.\n\n       •      For barchats, missing values are treated as if a value of zero\n\t      was given.\n\n       •      For time charts and Gantt charts missing values cause errors -\n\t      there is no use for them there.\n\nOTHER OUTPUT FORMATS\n       Besides output to the canvas on screen, the module is capable, via\n       canvas postscript, of producing PostScript files. One may wonder\n       whether it is possible to extend this set of output formats and the\n       answer is \"yes\". This section tries to sum up the aspects of using this\n       module for another sort of output.\n\n       One way you can create output files in a different format, is by\n       examining the contents of the canvas after everything has been drawn\n       and render that contents in the right form. This is probably the\n       easiest way, as it involves nothing more than the re-creation of all\n       the elements in the plot that are already there.\n\n       The drawback of that method is that you need to have a display, which\n       is not always the case if you run a CGI server or something like that.\n\n       An alternative is to emulate the canvas command. For this to work, you\n       need to know which canvas subcommands are used and what for. Obviously,\n       the create subcommand is used to create the lines, texts and other\n       items. But also the raise and lower subcommands are used, because with\n       these the module can influence the drawing order - important to\n       simulate a clipping rectangle around the axes. (The routine DrawMask is\n       responsible for this - if the output format supports proper clipping\n       areas, then a redefinition of this routine might just solve this).\n\n       Furthermore, the module uses the cget subcommand to find out the sizes\n       of the canvas. A more mundane aspect of this is that the module\n       currently assumes that the text is 14 pixels high and that 80 pixels in\n       width suffice for the axis' labels. No \"hook\" is provided to customise\n       this.\n\n       In summary:\n\n       •      Emulate the create subcommand to create all the items in the\n\t      correct format\n\n       •      Emulate the cget subcommand for the options -width and -height\n\t      to allow the correct calculation of the rectangle's position and\n\t      size\n\n       •      Solve the problem of raising and lowering the items so that they\n\t      are properly clipped, for instance by redefining the routine\n\t      DrawMask.\n\n       •      Take care of the currently fixed text size properties\n\nSPECIAL EFFECTS\n       As an example of some special effects you can achieve, here is the code\n       for a plot where the area below the data line varies in colour:\n\n       canvas .c  -background white -width 400 -height 200\n       pack .c -fill both\n\n       set s [::Plotchart::createXYPlot .c {0.0 100.0 10.0} {0.0 100.0 20.0}]\n\n       $s background gradient green top-down\n\n       $s dataconfig series1 -filled up -fillcolour white\n\n       $s plot series1\t0.0 20.0\n       $s plot series1 10.0 20.0\n       $s plot series1 30.0 50.0\n       $s plot series1 35.0 45.0\n       $s plot series1 45.0 25.0\n       $s plot series1 75.0 55.0\n       $s plot series1 100.0 55.0\n\n       $s plaintext 30.0 60.0 \"Peak\" south\n\n       The trick is to fill the background with a colour that changes from\n       green at the top to white at the bottom. Then the area above the data\n       line is filled with a white polygon. Thus the green shading varies with\n       the height of the line.\n\nROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT\n       In this version there are a lot of things that still need to be\n       implemented:\n\n       •      More robust handling of incorrect calls (right now the\n\t      procedures may fail when called incorrectly):\n\n\t      •      The axis drawing routines can not handle inverse axes\n\t\t     right now.\n\n\t      •      If the user provides an invalid date/time string, the\n\t\t     routines simply throw an error.\n\nRESIZING\n       Plotchart has not been designed to create plots and charts that keep\n       track of the data that are put in. This means that if an application\n       needs to allow the user to resize the window holding the plot or chart,\n       it must take care to redraw the complete plot.\n\n       The code below is a simple example of how to do that:\n\n       package require Plotchart\n\n       grid [canvas .c -background white] -sticky news\n       grid columnconfigure . 0 -weight 1\n       grid rowconfigure . 0 -weight 1\n\n       bind .c <Configure> {doResize}\n\n       proc doPlot {} {\n\t   #\n\t   # Clean up the contents (see also the note below!)\n\t   #\n\t   .c delete all\n\n\t   #\n\t   # (Re)draw the bar chart\n\t   #\n\t   set p [::Plotchart::createBarchart .c {x y z} {0 100 10} 3]\n\t   $p plot R {10 30 40} red\n\t   $p plot G {30 40 60} green\n       }\n\n       proc doResize {} {\n\t   global redo\n\n\t   #\n\t   # To avoid redrawing the plot many times during resizing,\n\t   # cancel the callback, until the last one is left.\n\t   #\n\t   if { [info exists redo] } {\n\t       after cancel $redo\n\t   }\n\n\t   set redo [after 50 doPlot]\n       }\n       Please note: The code above will work fine for barcharts and many other\n       types of plots, but as Plotchart keeps some private information for xy\n       plots, more is needed in these cases. This actually requires a command\n       \"destroyPlot\" to take care of such details. A next version of Plotchart\n       may have that.\n\n       Alternatively, you can use the xyplot package which is built on top of\n       Plotchart. This package supports zooming in and zooming out, as well as\n       resizing the plot as a whole. Here is a small demonstration program:\n\n       # xyplot_demo.tcl --\n       #     Demonstration of the xyplot package\n       #\n\n       package require xyplot\n\n       set xydata1 {}\n       set xydata2 {}\n       set xydata3 {}\n       set xydata4 {}\n       for { set i 0 } { $i < 1024 } { incr i } {\n\t   lappend xydata1 [expr {$i-1000}] [expr {$i * sin($i/4096.0*3.1415*2) * (sin($i/256.0*3.1415*2))}]\n\t   lappend xydata2 [expr {$i-1000}] [expr {$i * sin($i/4096.0*3.1415*2) * (sin($i/256.0*3.1415*2) + 0.25 * sin($i/256.0*3.1415*6))}]\n\t   lappend xydata3 [expr {$i-1000}] [expr {$i * sin($i/4096.0*3.1415*2) * (sin($i/256.0*3.1415*2) + 0.25 * sin($i/256.0*3.1415*6) + 0.0625 * sin($i/256.0*3.1415*10))}]\n\t   lappend xydata4 [expr {$i-1000}] [expr {$i * sin($i/4096.0*3.1415*2) * (sin($i/256.0*3.1415*2) + 0.25 * sin($i/256.0*3.1415*6) + 0.0625 * sin($i/256.0*3.1415*10) + 0.015625 * sin($i/256.0*3.1415*14))}]\n       }\n\n       set xyp [xyplot .xyp -xformat \"%5.0f\" -yformat \"%5.0f\" -title \"XY plot testing\" -background gray90]\n       pack $xyp -fill both -expand true\n\n       set s1 [$xyp add_data sf1 $xydata1 -legend \"Serie 1 data\" -color red]\n       set s2 [$xyp add_data sf2 $xydata2 -legend \"Serie 2 data\" -color green]\n       set s3 [$xyp add_data sf3 $xydata3 -legend \"Serie 3 data\" -color blue]\n       set s4 [$xyp add_data sf4 $xydata4 -legend \"Serie 4 data\" -color orange]\n\n       set xyp2 [xyplot .xyp2 -xticks 8 -yticks 4 -yformat %.2f -xformat %.0f]\n       pack $xyp2 -fill both -expand true\n\n       set s1 [$xyp2 add_data sf1 $xydata1]\n       set s2 [$xyp2 add_data sf2 $xydata2]\n       set s3 [$xyp2 add_data sf3 $xydata3]\n       set s4 [$xyp2 add_data sf4 $xydata4]\n\n       Zooming in is done by selecting a rectangle with the left mouse button\n       pressed. Zooming out is done by pressing the right mouse button. If you\n       resize the window, the canvases inside are resized too. If you zoom in,\n       you can scroll the plot via the scrollbars that are automatically\n       attached.\n\nZOOMING IN\n       As the Plotchart package does not keep track of the data itself,\n       rescaling an existing plot - for instance when zooming in - would have\n       to be done by redefining the plot and redrawing the data. However, the\n       canvas widget offers a way out by scaling and moving items, so that\n       zooming in becomes a bit simpler.\n\n       Whether zooming is indeed useful, depends on the type of plot.\n       Currently it is defined for XY-plots only. The method is called\n       \"rescale\" and simply redraws the axes and scales and moves the data\n       items so that they conform to the new axes. The drawback is that any\n       symbols are scaled by the same amount. The rescale method works best\n       for plots that only have lines, not symbols.\n\n       The method works very simply:\n\n\t  $p rescale {newxmin newxmax newxstep} {newymin newymax newystep}"

Each argument is\n\t      optional.\n\n\t      string charttype (in)\n\t\t     The type of chart or plot (see the configuration type\n\t\t     that is mentioned for each create command). If not given\n\t\t     or empty, a list of chart types is returned. If it is\n\t\t     given, the properties for that particular type are used.\n\n\t      string component (in)\n\t\t     The component of the plot/chart: leftaxis, rightaxis,\n\t\t     background, margin and so on. If not given or empty, a\n\t\t     list of components is returned. If it is given, the\n\t\t     properties for that particular component will be set for\n\t\t     that particular type of chart.\n\n\t      string property (in)\n\t\t     The property of the component of the plot/chart:\n\t\t     textcolor, thickness of the axis line, etc. If not given\n\t\t     or empty, a list of properties is returned. If it is\n\t\t     given, that particular property for that particular\n\t\t     component will be set for that particular type of chart.\n\n\t      string value (in)\n\t\t     The new value for the property. If empty, the current\n\t\t     value is returned.  If the value is \"default\", the\n\t\t     default value will be restored.\n\n\t\t     Note, that in some cases an empty value is useful. Use\n\t\t     \"none\" in this case - it can be useful for colours and\n\t\t     for formats.\n\n       Below is a more detailed list of the components and properties:\n\n       •      Axes come in a wide variety:\n\n\t      •      leftaxis, rightaxis, topaxis, bottomaxis for the plots\n\t\t     with a rectangular shape.\n\n\t      •      xaxis, yaxis and zaxis are used for the 3D plots\n\n\t      •      axis, this represents the radial and tangential axes of a\n\t\t     polar plot\n       All axes have the following properties:\n\n\t      •      color - the colour of the line and the tickmarks\n\n\t      •      thickness - the width of the line of the axis itself, not\n\t\t     the tickmarks\n\n\t      •      ticklength - the length of the tickmarks in pixels. A\n\t\t     positive value is outward, a negative value is inward.\n\n\t      •      font - the font for the labels and the text at the axis\n\n\t      •      format - the format for rendering the (numerical) labels.\n\t\t     For the time axis it is the format for a date and time.\n\n\t      •      textcolor - the colour for the labels and the text.\n\n       •      The margin is important for the layout. Currently only the\n\t      rectangular plots allow the margins to be set: left, right, top\n\t      and bottom.  The values are in pixels.\n\n       •      The text component is meant for any text appearing via the\n\t      plaintext subcommand. The properties are: textcolor, font and\n\t      anchor (positioning of the text relative to the given\n\t      coordinates).\n\n       •      The background has two properties: outercolor, the colour\n\t      outside of the actual plot, and innercolor, the colour inside\n\t      the plot. (Note: only \"outercolor\" has now been implemented).\n\n       •      The legend has three properties: background, border and\n\t      position.  See the legend subcommand for the meaning.\n\n       See the examples in plotdemos7.tcl for it use.\n\nSCROLLING FOR TIMECHARTS AND GANTT CHARTS\n       For two types of plots automatic scrolling management has been\n       implemented: timecharts and Gantt charts. The subcommands hscroll and\n       vscroll associate (existing) scrollbars to the plot, in much the same\n       way as for text and canvas widgets.\n\n       Once the association is made, the scrollbars are automatically updated\n       if:\n\n       •      You add an item with a period wider than the current one.\n\n       •      You add a vertical line for a time beyond the current bounds.\n\n       •      You add an extra item beyond the number that was used to create\n\t      the chart.\n\n       For instance:\n\n       package require Plotchart\n\n       canvas .c -width 400 -height 200\n       scrollbar .y -orient vertical\n       scrollbar .x -orient horizontal\n\n       grid .c .y -sticky news\n       grid .x\t  -sticky news\n\n       source plotchart.tcl\n\n       set s [::Plotchart::createTimechart .c \"1 january 2004\"\t\"31 december 2004\" 4]\n\n       $s period \"Spring\" \"1 march 2004\" \"1 june 2004\" green\n       $s period \"Summer\" \"1 june 2004\" \"1 september 2004\" yellow\n       $s vertline \"1 jan\" \"1 january 2004\"\n       $s vertline \"1 apr\" \"1 april 2004\"\n       $s vertline \"1 jul\" \"1 july 2004\"\n       $s vertline \"1 oct\" \"1 october 2004\"\n       $s vertline \"1 jan\" \"1 january 2005\"\n       $s vertline \"1 apr\" \"1 april 2005\"\n       $s vertline \"1 jul\" \"1 july 2005\"\n       $s milestone \"Longest day\" \"21 july 2004\"\n       $s milestone \"Longest day 2\" \"21 july 2004\"\n       $s milestone \"Longest day 3\" \"21 july 2004\"\n       $s milestone \"Longest day 4\" \"21 july 2004\"\n       $s milestone \"Longest day 5\" \"21 july 2004\"\n       $s milestone \"Longest day 6\" \"21 july 2004\"\n       $s title \"Seasons (northern hemisphere)\"\n\n       $s vscroll .y\n       $s hscroll .x\n\n       The original extent of the chart is from 1 january 2004 to 31 december\n       2004. But because of the addition of vertical lines in 2005 and more\n       items than was specified at the creation of the chart, both the\n       horizontal and the vertical scrollbar will be enabled.\n\nSPECIALISED PLOTS\n       Most of the plot and chart types described above have a fairly general\n       use and you simply prepares the data to be plotted yourself. This\n       section describes several plot types that are more specialised, in the\n       sense that they have specific purposes and you pass raw data that are\n       then processed in the plotting routines.\n\n       Currently there are the following types:\n\n       •      Target diagrams are used to assess the capacity of numerical\n\t      models to reproduce measurement data. They are described in\n\t      detail in:\n\n\t      Jason K.

This section documents the tags that are used.\n\n       (Note: the tags are not always used consistently - see the notes\n       appearing with the various tags. This section describes the current\n       state.)\n\n       General graphical objects:\n\n       •      mask - Used to manipulate the opaque rectangles that ensure data\n\t      outside the viewport are not shown.\n\n       •      topmask, horizmask, vertmask - specialised tags, used for\n\t      scrollable plots.\n\n       •      title - Used for title strings.  BalloonText, BalloonFrame -\n\t      Used to manipulate balloon text.\tPlainText - Used to manipulate\n\t      ordinary text without any decoration.  background - Tag used for\n\t      gradient and image backgrounds (and for gradient-filled bars).\n\t      xaxis, yaxis - Tags used for all objects related to horizontal\n\t      or vertical axes.  (also: both for numerical axes and axes with\n\t      labels as in barcharts).\tNote, however, that the text along the\n\t      axes has no particular tag.  raxis - Tag used for all objects\n\t      related to a right axis.\ttaxis - Tag used for all objects\n\t      related to a time axis.  axis3d - Tag used for 3D axes\n\t      xtickline, ytickline - Tags used for ticklines.  legend,\n\t      legengb, legendobj - Tags used for the legend. The latter is\n\t      used to manipulate the legend as a whole.  legend_series - Tag\n\t      used to control the appearance of the legend entry (\"series\"\n\t      should be replaced by the series name).\n\n       XY-plots (all types of axes):\n\n       •      data - The general tag to identify graphical objects associated\n\t      with data.  data_seriesname - The tag specific to a data series\n\t      (\"seriesname\" should be replaced).  band - The horizontal or\n\t      vertical band drawn with the xband otr yband subcommands have\n\t      this tag by the actual name).\n\n       Items such as labelled dots only have the \"data\" tag.\n\n       Piecharts:\n\n       •      segment_segmentnumber - The tag identifying the segment, the\n\t      string \"segmentnumber\" should be replaced by the actual number.\n\t      This tag is used to explode the segments.\n\n       Barcharts:\n\n       Barcharts use the same tags as xy-plots (but for gradient-filled bars\n       the data_seriesname is not used).\n\n       Histograms and isometric plots:\n\n       Currently the only tag used is \"data\".\n\n       Time-charts:\n\n       As these plots are scrollable, several tags are used specific to the\n       scrolling: vertscroll, horizscroll, below, lowest, above, timeline,\n       tline.  Each item also has a tag of the form \"item_number\", where\n       \"number\" is to be replaced by the actual sequence number of the item.\n\n       Gantt charts:\n\n       In addition to the tags described for the time-charts, the following\n       tags are used: description, completed, summary and summarybar.\n\n       Radial charts and polar plots:\n\n       Currently the radial lines indicating the grid have no tags.
