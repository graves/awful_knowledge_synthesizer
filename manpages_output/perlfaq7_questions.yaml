All C operators that Perl copies have the same\n       precedence in Perl as they do in C. The problem is with operators that\n       C doesn't have, especially functions that give a list context to\n       everything on their right, eg. print, chmod, exec, and so on. Such\n       functions are called \"list operators\" and appear as such in the\n       precedence table in perlop.\n\n       A common mistake is to write:\n\n\t   unlink $file || die \"snafu\";\n\n       This gets interpreted as:\n\n\t   unlink ($file || die \"snafu\");\n\n       To avoid this problem, either put in extra parentheses or use the super\n       low precedence \"or\" operator:\n\n\t   (unlink $file) || die \"snafu\";\n\t   unlink $file or die \"snafu\";\n\n       The \"English\" operators (\"and\", \"or\", \"xor\", and \"not\") deliberately\n       have precedence lower than that of list operators for just such\n       situations as the one above.\n\n       Another operator with surprising precedence is exponentiation. It binds\n       more tightly even than unary minus, making \"-2**2\" produce a negative\n       four and not a positive one. It is also right-associating, meaning that\n       \"2**3**2\" is two raised to the ninth power, not eight squared."

Since you wrap this in a BEGIN\n       block, $count is defined at compile-time, but also goes out of scope at\n       the end of the BEGIN block.

    See "Persistent Private Variables" in perlsub for more information.
           The discussion of closures in perlref may help you even though we did
           not use anonymous subroutines in this answer. See "Persistent Private
           Variables" in perlsub for details.

       What's the difference between dynamic and lexical (static) scoping? Between
           local() and my()?
           "local($x)" saves away the old value of the global variable $x and
           assigns a new value for the duration of the subroutine which is visible
           in other functions called from that subroutine. This is done at run-
           time, so is called dynamic scoping. local() always affects global
           variables, also called package variables or dynamic variables.

           "my($x)" creates a new variable that is only visible in the current
           subroutine. This is done at compile-time, so it is called lexical or
           static scoping. my() always affects private variables, also called
           lexical variables or (improperly) static(ly scoped) variables.

    Manpage text:

    All those functions (red(), blue(), green(), etc.) appear to be
           separate, but the real code in the closure actually was compiled only
           once.

           So, sometimes you might want to use symbolic references to manipulate
           the symbol table directly. This doesn't matter for formats, handles,
           and subroutines, because they are always global--you can't use my() on
           them.  For scalars, arrays, and hashes, though--and usually for
           subroutines-- you probably only want to use hard references.

       What does "bad interpreter" mean?
           (contributed by brian d foy)

           The "bad interpreter" message comes from the shell, not perl. The
           actual message may vary depending on your platform, shell, and locale
           settings.

           If you see "bad interpreter - no such file or directory", the first
           line in your perl script (the "shebang" line) does not contain the
           right path to perl (or any other program capable of running scripts).
           Sometimes this happens when you move the script from one machine to
           another and each machine has a different path to perl--/usr/bin/perl
           versus /usr/local/bin/perl for instance. It may also indicate that the
           source machine has CRLF line terminators and the destination machine
           has LF only: the shell tries to find /usr/bin/perl<CR>, but can't.
