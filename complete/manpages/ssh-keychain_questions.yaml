It provides identities from\n     CryptoTokenKit tokens (SmartCards and persistent tokens) to the tools.\n\nOVERVIEW\n     By default, all valid (RSA for PKCS#11 and ecdsa256 for Secure Key\n     module) identities from all SmartCards and persistent tokens currently\n     available in the system are provided.  Manual configuration of\n     ssh-keychain.dylib is required if there is a need to limit which token\n     identities are provided.  The public key hash is used to select which\n     identities should be provided.  This hash is usually in hexadecimal\n     string form, without the leading 0x.  To determine the hash for identity\n     use the sc_auth list-ctk-identities and sc_auth identities commands or\n     pkhh attribute from security export-smartcard output."

The variable KEYCHAIN_CERTIFICATES is used to\n     specify hashes.  It should contain a semicolon-separated list of public\n     key hashes of certificates which will be provided to the ssh tools.\n\nCONFIG FILE\n     If no enviroment variable configuration is provided, ssh-keychain.dylib\n     looks for a configuration file located at ~/.ssh/sshkeychain.plist.  This\n     file is a standard property-list with a dictionary root object.  It\n     should contain the key KeychainCertificates with a value that is either a\n     string or an array of strings.  If a string, then the expected value is\n     semicolon-separated list of public key hashes like the environment\n     variable.\tIf the value is an array, then each hash is an array entry.\n\nFILES\n     ~/.ssh/sshkeychain.plist\n\nEXAMPLES\n     Environment:\n\t     KEYCHAIN_CERTIFICATES=\"AE31125DA4AAA294A4FED97B815D7F8DD1A78FF3;168D2C4CDDFCDADD465BAF3E6BCFE8193D8D42D1\"\n\t     ssh -o PKCS11Provider=/usr/lib/ssh-keychain.dylib machine"
