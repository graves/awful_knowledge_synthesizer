Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `relocated`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nRELOCATED(5)\t\t      File Formats Manual\t\t  RELOCATED(5)\n\n\nNAME\n       relocated - Postfix relocated table format\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       postmap /etc/postfix/relocated\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The optional relocated(5) table provides the information that is used\n       in \"user has moved to new_location\" bounce messages.\n\n       Normally, the relocated(5) table is specified as a text file that\n       serves as input to the postmap(1) command.  The result, an indexed file\n       in dbm or db format, is used for fast searching by the mail system.\n       Execute the command \"postmap /etc/postfix/relocated\" to rebuild an\n       indexed file after changing the corresponding relocated table.\n\n       When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP or SQL,\n       the same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.\n\n       Alternatively, the table can be provided as a regular-expression map\n       where patterns are given as regular expressions, or lookups can be\n       directed to TCP-based server. In those case, the lookups are done in a\n       slightly different way as described below under \"REGULAR EXPRESSION\n       TABLES\" or \"TCP-BASED TABLES\".\n\n       Table lookups are case insensitive.\n\nCASE FOLDING\n       The search string is folded to lowercase before database lookup. As of\n       Postfix 2.3, the search string is not case folded with database types\n       such as regexp: or pcre: whose lookup fields can match both upper and\n       lower case.\n\nTABLE FORMAT\n       The input format for the postmap(1) command is as follows:\n\n       •      An entry has one of the following form:\n\n\t\t   pattern\tnew_location\n\n\t      Where new_location specifies contact information such as an\n\t      email address, or perhaps a street address or telephone number.\n\n       •      Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as are lines\n\t      whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.\n\n       •      A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that\n\t      starts with whitespace continues a logical line.\n\nTABLE SEARCH ORDER\n       With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked\n       tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, patterns are tried in the order as\n       listed below:\n\n       user@domain\n\t      Matches user@domain. This form has precedence over all other\n\t      forms.\n\n       user   Matches user@site when site is $myorigin, when site is listed in\n\t      $mydestination, or when site is listed in $inet_interfaces or\n\t      $proxy_interfaces.\n\n       @domain\n\t      Matches other addresses in domain. This form has the lowest\n\t      precedence.\n\nADDRESS EXTENSION\n       When a mail address localpart contains the optional recipient delimiter\n       (e.g., user+foo@domain), the lookup order becomes: user+foo@domain,\n       user@domain, user+foo, user, and @domain.\n\nREGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES\n       This section describes how the table lookups change when the table is\n       given in the form of regular expressions or when lookups are directed\n       to a TCP-based server. For a description of regular expression lookup\n       table syntax, see regexp_table(5) or pcre_table(5). For a description\n       of the TCP client/server table lookup protocol, see tcp_table(5).  This\n       feature is not available up to and including Postfix version 2.4.\n\n       Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to the entire\n       address being looked up. Thus, user@domain mail addresses are not\n       broken up into their user and @domain constituent parts, nor is\n       user+foo broken up into user and foo.\n\n       Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a\n       pattern is found that matches the search string.\n\n       Results are the same as with indexed file lookups, with the additional\n       feature that parenthesized substrings from the pattern can be\n       interpolated as $1, $2 and so on.\n\nTCP-BASED TABLES\n       This section describes how the table lookups change when lookups are\n       directed to a TCP-based server. For a description of the TCP\n       client/server lookup protocol, see tcp_table(5).  This feature is not\n       available up to and including Postfix version 2.4.\n\n       Each lookup operation uses the entire address once.  Thus, user@domain\n       mail addresses are not broken up into their user and @domain\n       constituent parts, nor is user+foo broken up into user and foo.\n\n       Results are the same as with indexed file lookups.\n\nBUGS\n       The table format does not understand quoting conventions.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       The following main.cf parameters are especially relevant.  The text\n       below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for more\n       details including examples.\n\n       relocated_maps\n\t      List of lookup tables for relocated users or sites.\n\n       Other parameters of interest:\n\n       inet_interfaces\n\t      The network interface addresses that this system receives mail\n\t      on.  You need to stop and start Postfix when this parameter\n\t      changes.\n\n       mydestination\n\t      List of domains that this mail system considers local.\n\n       myorigin\n\t      The domain that is appended to locally-posted mail.\n\n       proxy_interfaces\n\t      Other interfaces that this machine receives mail on by way of a\n\t      proxy agent or network address translator.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       trivial-rewrite(8), address resolver\n       postmap(1), Postfix lookup table manager\n       postconf(5), configuration parameters\n\nREADME FILES\n       Use \"postconf readme_directory\" or \"postconf html_directory\" to locate\n       this information.\n       DATABASE_README, Postfix lookup table overview\n       ADDRESS_REWRITING_README, address rewriting guide\n\nLICENSE\n       The Secure Mailer license must be distributed with this software.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n       Wietse Venema\n       IBM T.J.
