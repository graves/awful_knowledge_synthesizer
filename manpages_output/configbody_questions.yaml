Public variables act like configuration options for\n       an object.  They can be modified outside the class scope using the\n       built-in configure method.  Each variable can have a bit of \"config\"\n       code associate with it that is automatically executed when the variable\n       is configured.  The configbody command can be used to define or\n       redefine this body of code.\n\n       Like the body command, this facility allows a class definition to have\n       separate \"interface\" and \"implementation\" parts.  The \"interface\" part\n       is a class command with declarations for methods, procs, instance\n       variables and common variables.\tThe \"implementation\" part is a series\n       of body and configbody commands.  If the \"implementation\" part is kept\n       in a separate file, it can be sourced again and again as bugs are\n       fixed, to support interactive development.  When using the \"tcl\" mode\n       in the emacs editor, the \"interface\" and \"implementation\" parts can be\n       kept in the same file; as bugs are fixed, individual bodies can be\n       highlighted and sent to the test application.\n\n       The name \"className::varName\" identifies the public variable being\n       updated.  If the body string starts with \"@\", it is treated as the\n       symbolic name for a C procedure.  Otherwise, it is treated as a Tcl\n       command script.\n\n       Symbolic names for C procedures are established by registering\n       procedures via Itcl_RegisterC().  This is usually done in the\n       Tcl_AppInit() procedure, which is automatically called when the\n       interpreter starts up.  In the following example, the procedure\n       My_FooCmd() is registered with the symbolic name \"foo\".\tThis procedure\n       can be referenced in the configbody command as \"@foo\".\n\t      int\n\t      Tcl_AppInit(interp)\n\t\t  Tcl_Interp *interp;\t  /* Interpreter for application. */\n\t      {\n\t\t  if (Itcl_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {\n\t\t      return TCL_ERROR;\n\t\t  }\n\n\t\t  if (Itcl_RegisterC(interp, \"foo\", My_FooCmd) != TCL_OK) {\n\t\t      return TCL_ERROR;\n\t\t  }\n\t      }"
