As such it is an internal package a regular\n       user (developer) should not be in direct contact with.\n\n       If you are such please go the documentation of either\n\n       [1]    doctools::doc,\n\n       [2]    doctools::toc, or\n\n       [3]    doctools::idx\n\n       Within the system architecture this package resides under the various\n       parser packages, and is shared by them. Underneath it, but not explicit\n       dependencies, are the packages providing the message catalogs for the\n       various languages.\n\nAPI\n       ::doctools::msgcat::init prefix\n\t      The command locates and loads the message catalogs for all the\n\t      languages returned by msgcat::mcpreferences, provided that they\n\t      could be found. It returns an integer number describing how many\n\t      packages were found and loaded.\n\n\t      The names of the packages the command will look for have the\n\t      form \"doctools::msgcat::prefix::langcode\", with prefix the\n\t      argument to the command, and the langcode supplied by the result\n\t      of msgcat::mcpreferences.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category doctools\n       of the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       catalog package, docidx, doctoc, doctools, i18n, internationalization,\n       l10n, localization, message catalog, message package\n\nCATEGORY\n       Documentation tools\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2009 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
