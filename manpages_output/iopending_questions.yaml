Uses DTrace.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       iopending [-c] [-d device] [-f filename] [-m mount_point] [interval\n       [count]]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This samples the number of disk events that are pending and plots a\n       distribution graph. By doing this the \"serialness\" or \"parallelness\" of\n       disk behaviour can be distinguished.  A high occurance of a pending\n       value of more than 1 is an indication of saturation.\n\n       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this\n       command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -c     clear screen\n\n       -d device\n\t      instance name to snoop (eg, dad0)\n\n       -f filename\n\t      full pathname of file to snoop\n\n       -m mount_point\n\t      mountpoint for filesystem to snoop\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Default output, print I/O summary every 1 second,\n\t      # iopending\n\n       Print 10 second samples,\n\t      # iopending 10\n\n       Print 12 x 5 second samples,\n\t      # iopending 5 12\n\n       Snoop events on the root filesystem only,\n\t      # iopending -m /\n\nFIELDS\n       value  number of pending events, 0 == idle\n\n       count  number of samples @ 1000 Hz\n\n       load   1 min load average\n\n       disk_r total disk read Kb for sample\n\n       disk_w total disk write Kb for sample\n\nIDEA\n       Dr Rex di Bona\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs\n       directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with\n       verbose descriptions explaining the output.\n\nEXIT\n       iopending will run forever until Ctrl-C is hit, or the specified count\n       is reached.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Brendan Gregg [Sydney, Australia]\n\nSEE ALSO\n       iosnoop(1M), iotop(1M), dtrace(1M)"
