Unless this option is specified,\n\t     znew refuses to overwrite existing files.\n\n     -t      Test integrity of the gzipped file before deleting the original\n\t     file.  If the integrity check fails, the original ‘.Z’ file is\n\t     not removed.\n\n     -v      Print a report specifying the achieved compression ratios.\n\n     -9      Use the -9 mode of gzip(1), achieving better compression at the\n\t     cost of slower execution.\n\n     -K      Keep the original ‘.Z’ file if it uses less disk blocks than the\n\t     gzipped one.  A disk block is 1024 bytes.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     gzip(1)\n\nCAVEATS\n     The znew utility tries to maintain the file mode of the original file.\n     If the original file is not writable, it is not able to do that and znew\n     will print a warning."

  manpageQuestion3: What command would you use to test the integrity of a gzipped file before deleting the original .Z file when using znew?
