It provides\n     secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an\n     insecure network.\n\n     sshd listens for connections from clients.  It is normally started at\n     boot from /etc/rc.  It forks a new daemon for each incoming connection.\n     The forked daemons handle key exchange, encryption, authentication,\n     command execution, and data exchange.\n\n     sshd can be configured using command-line options or a configuration file\n     (by default sshd_config(5)); command-line options override values\n     specified in the configuration file.  sshd rereads its configuration file\n     when it receives a hangup signal, SIGHUP, by executing itself with the\n     name and options it was started with, e.g. /usr/sbin/sshd."

This key agreement results in a shared session key.  The rest\n     of the session is encrypted using a symmetric cipher.  The client selects\n     the encryption algorithm to use from those offered by the server.\n     Additionally, session integrity is provided through a cryptographic\n     message authentication code (MAC)."

    SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS FILE FORMAT
         The /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts and ~/.ssh/known_hosts files contain host
         public keys for all known hosts.  The global file should be prepared by
         the administrator (optional), and the per-user file is maintained
         automatically: whenever the user connects to an unknown host, its key is
         added to the per-user file.

         Each line in these files contains the following fields: marker
         (optional), hostnames, keytype, base64-encoded key, comment.  The fields
         are separated by spaces.

         The marker is optional, but if it is present then it must be one of
         “@cert-authority”, to indicate that the line contains a certification
         authority (CA) key, or “@revoked”, to indicate that the key contained on
         the line is revoked and must not ever be accepted.  Only one marker
         should be used on a key line.

         Hostnames is a comma-separated list of patterns (‘*’ and ‘?’ act as
         wildcards); each pattern in turn is matched against the host name.  When
         sshd is authenticating a client, such as when using
         HostbasedAuthentication, this will be the canonical client host name.
         When ssh(1) is authenticating a server, this will be the host name given
         by the user, the value of the ssh(1) HostkeyAlias if it was specified, or
         the canonical server hostname if the ssh(1) CanonicalizeHostname option
         was used.

  manpageQuestion2: How can you verify that an SSH host key is a certification authority (CA) key using the ssh_known_hosts file?

- prompt: |-
    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `sshd`.



    Manpage text:

    A pattern may also be preceded by ‘!’ to indicate negation: if the host
         name matches a negated pattern, it is not accepted (by that line) even if
         it matched another pattern on the line.  A hostname or address may
         optionally be enclosed within ‘[’ and ‘]’ brackets then followed by ‘:’
         and a non-standard port number.

         Alternately, hostnames may be stored in a hashed form which hides host
         names and addresses should the file's contents be disclosed.  Hashed
         hostnames start with a ‘|’ character.  Only one hashed hostname may
         appear on a single line and none of the above negation or wildcard
         operators may be applied.

         The keytype and base64-encoded key are taken directly from the host key;
         they can be obtained, for example, from /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub.
         The optional comment field continues to the end of the line, and is not
         used.

         Lines starting with ‘#’ and empty lines are ignored as comments.

         When performing host authentication, authentication is accepted if any
         matching line has the proper key; either one that matches exactly or, if
         the server has presented a certificate for authentication, the key of the
         certification authority that signed the certificate.  For a key to be
         trusted as a certification authority, it must use the “@cert-authority”
         marker described above.

    Manpage text:

    The known hosts file also provides a facility to mark keys as revoked,
         for example when it is known that the associated private key has been
         stolen.  Revoked keys are specified by including the “@revoked” marker at
         the beginning of the key line, and are never accepted for authentication
         or as certification authorities, but instead will produce a warning from
         ssh(1) when they are encountered.

         It is permissible (but not recommended) to have several lines or
         different host keys for the same names.  This will inevitably happen when
         short forms of host names from different domains are put in the file.  It
         is possible that the files contain conflicting information;
         authentication is accepted if valid information can be found from either
         file.

         Note that the lines in these files are typically hundreds of characters
         long, and you definitely don't want to type in the host keys by hand.
         Rather, generate them by a script, ssh-keyscan(1) or by taking, for
         example, /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub and adding the host names at the
         front.  ssh-keygen(1) also offers some basic automated editing for
         ~/.ssh/known_hosts including removing hosts matching a host name and
         converting all host names to their hashed representations.
