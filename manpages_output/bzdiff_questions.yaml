Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `bzdiff`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nBZDIFF(1)\t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t     BZDIFF(1)\n\n\n\n\nNAME\n       bzcmp, bzdiff - compare bzip2 compressed files\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       bzcmp [ cmp_options ] file1 [ file2 ]\n       bzdiff [ diff_options ] file1 [ file2 ]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       Bzcmp and bzdiff are used to invoke the cmp or the diff program on\n       bzip2 compressed files.\tAll options specified are passed directly to\n       cmp or diff.  If only 1 file is specified, then the files compared are\n       file1 and an uncompressed file1.bz2.  If two files are specified, then\n       they are uncompressed if necessary and fed to cmp or diff.  The exit\n       status from cmp or diff is preserved.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       cmp(1), diff(1), bzmore(1), bzless(1), bzgrep(1), bzip2(1)\n\nBUGS\n       Messages from the cmp or diff programs refer to temporary filenames\n       instead of those specified.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     BZDIFF(1)"
