It is designed to help the administrator control the\n       functioning of the Apache httpd daemon.\n\n\n       The apachectl script can operate in two modes. First, it can act as a\n       simple front-end to the httpd command that simply sets any necessary\n       environment variables and then invokes httpd, passing through any\n       command line arguments. Second, apachectl can act as a SysV init\n       script, taking simple one-word arguments like start, restart, and stop,\n       and translating them into appropriate signals to httpd.\n\n\n       If your Apache installation uses non-standard paths, you will need to\n       edit the apachectl script to set the appropriate paths to the httpd\n       binary. You can also specify any necessary httpd command line\n       arguments. See the comments in the script for details.\n\n\n       The apachectl script returns a 0 exit value on success, and >0 if an\n       error occurs. For more details, view the comments in the script."

It parses the\n\t      configuration files and either reports Syntax Ok or detailed\n\t      information about the particular syntax error. This is\n\t      equivalent to apachectl -t.\n\n\n       The following option was available in earlier versions but has been\n       removed."
