If the message\n     is too long to pass atomically through the underlying protocol, the error\n     EMSGSIZE is returned, and the message is not transmitted.\n\n     No indication of failure to deliver is implicit in a send().  Locally\n     detected errors are indicated by a return value of -1."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `send`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIf no messages space is available at the socket to hold the message to be\n     transmitted, then send() normally blocks, unless the socket has been\n     placed in non-blocking I/O mode.  The select(2) call may be used to\n     determine when it is possible to send more data.\n\n     The flags parameter may include one or more of the following:\n\n     #define MSG_OOB\t    0x1  /* process out-of-band data */\n     #define MSG_DONTROUTE  0x4  /* bypass routing, use direct interface */\n\n     The flag MSG_OOB is used to send “out-of-band” data on sockets that\n     support this notion (e.g.\tSOCK_STREAM); the underlying protocol must\n     also support “out-of-band” data.  MSG_DONTROUTE is usually used only by\n     diagnostic or routing programs.\n\n     The sendmsg() system call uses a msghdr structure to minimize the number\n     of directly supplied arguments.  The msg_iov and msg_iovlen fields of\n     message specify zero or more buffers containing the data to be sent.\n     msg_iov points to an array of iovec structures; msg_iovlen shall be set\n     to the dimension of this array.  In each iovec structure, the iov_base\n     field specifies a storage area and the iov_len field gives its size in\n     bytes. Some of these sizes can be zero.  The data from each storage area\n     indicated by msg_iov is sent in turn.  See recv(2) for a complete\n     description of the msghdr structure."
