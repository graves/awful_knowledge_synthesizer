The only difference between them is the\n       place that the filter is installed.\n\n       To summarise:\n\n       filter_store_key\n\t    If a filter has been installed with this method, it will be\n\t    invoked every time you write a key to a DBM database.\n\n       filter_store_value\n\t    If a filter has been installed with this method, it will be\n\t    invoked every time you write a value to a DBM database.\n\n       filter_fetch_key\n\t    If a filter has been installed with this method, it will be\n\t    invoked every time you read a key from a DBM database.\n\n       filter_fetch_value\n\t    If a filter has been installed with this method, it will be\n\t    invoked every time you read a value from a DBM database.\n\n       You can use any combination of the methods from none to all four.\n\n       All filter methods return the existing filter, if present, or \"undef\"\n       if not.\n\n       To delete a filter pass \"undef\" to it.\n\n   The Filter\n       When each filter is called by Perl, a local copy of $_ will contain the\n       key or value to be filtered. Filtering is achieved by modifying the\n       contents of $_. The return code from the filter is ignored.\n\n   An Example: the NULL termination problem.\n       DBM Filters are useful for a class of problems where you always want to\n       make the same transformation to all keys, all values or both.\n\n       For example, consider the following scenario. You have a DBM database\n       that you need to share with a third-party C application. The C\n       application assumes that all keys and values are NULL terminated.\n       Unfortunately when Perl writes to DBM databases it doesn't use NULL\n       termination, so your Perl application will have to manage NULL\n       termination itself. When you write to the database you will have to use\n       something like this:\n\n\t   $hash{\"$key\\0\"} = \"$value\\0\";\n\n       Similarly the NULL needs to be taken into account when you are\n       considering the length of existing keys/values.\n\n       It would be much better if you could ignore the NULL terminations issue\n       in the main application code and have a mechanism that automatically\n       added the terminating NULL to all keys and values whenever you write to\n       the database and have them removed when you read from the database. As\n       I'm sure you have already guessed, this is a problem that DBM Filters\n       can fix very easily.\n\n\t   use strict;\n\t   use warnings;\n\t   use SDBM_File;\n\t   use Fcntl;\n\n\t   my %hash;\n\t   my $filename = \"filt\";\n\t   unlink $filename;\n\n\t   my $db = tie(%hash, 'SDBM_File', $filename, O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0640)\n\t     or die \"Cannot open $filename: $!\\n\";\n\n\t   # Install DBM Filters\n\t   $db->filter_fetch_key  ( sub { s/\\0$//    } );\n\t   $db->filter_store_key  ( sub { $_ .= \"\\0\" } );\n\t   $db->filter_fetch_value(\n\t       sub { no warnings 'uninitialized'; s/\\0$// } );\n\t   $db->filter_store_value( sub { $_ .= \"\\0\" } );\n\n\t   $hash{\"abc\"} = \"def\";\n\t   my $a = $hash{\"ABC\"};\n\t   # ...\n\t   undef $db;\n\t   untie %hash;\n\n       The code above uses SDBM_File, but it will work with any of the DBM\n       modules.\n\n       Hopefully the contents of each of the filters should be self-\n       explanatory. Both \"fetch\" filters remove the terminating NULL, and both\n       \"store\" filters add a terminating NULL.\n\n   Another Example: Key is a C int.\n       Here is another real-life example. By default, whenever Perl writes to\n       a DBM database it always writes the key and value as strings. So when\n       you use this:\n\n\t   $hash{12345} = \"something\";\n\n       the key 12345 will get stored in the DBM database as the 5 byte string\n       \"12345\". If you actually want the key to be stored in the DBM database\n       as a C int, you will have to use \"pack\" when writing, and \"unpack\" when\n       reading.\n\n       Here is a DBM Filter that does it:\n\n\t   use strict;\n\t   use warnings;\n\t   use DB_File;\n\t   my %hash;\n\t   my $filename = \"filt\";\n\t   unlink $filename;"
