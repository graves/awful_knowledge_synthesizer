The widget contains display areas for chat messages,\n       user names and topic and an entry area. It automatically handles\n       colourization of messages per nick and manages nick completion. A\n       system of hooks permit the application author to adjust display\n       features. The main chat display area may be split for use displaying\n       history or for searching.\n\n       The widget is made up of a number of text widget and panedwindow\n       widgets so that the size of each part of the display may be adjusted by\n       the user. All the text widgets may be accessed via widget passthrough\n       commands if fine adjustment is required. The topic and names sections\n       can also be hidden if desired.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::chatwidget::chatwidget path ?options?\n\t      Create a new chatwidget using the Tk window id path. Any options\n\t      provided are currently passed directly to the main chat text\n\t      widget.\n\nWIDGET COMMANDS\n       $widget topic command args\n\t      The chat widget can display a topic string, for instance the\n\t      topic or name given to a multi-user chatroom or irc channel.\n\n\t      show   Enable display of the topic.\n\n\t      hide   Disable display of the topic\n\n\t      set topic\n\t\t     Set the topic text to topic.\n\n       $widget name nick args\n\t      Control the names and tags associated with names.\n\n\t      list ?-full?\n\t\t     Returns a list of all the user names from the names view.\n\t\t     If ?-full? is given then the list returned is a list of\n\t\t     lists where each sublist is made up of the nick followed\n\t\t     by any options that have been set on this nick entry.\n\t\t     This may be used to examine any application specific\n\t\t     options that may be applied to a nick when using the add\n\t\t     command.\n\n\t      add nick ?options?\n\n\t      delete nick\n\n       $widget message text args\n\t      Add messages to the display. options are -nick, -time, -type,\n\t      -mark -tags\n\n       $widget hook command args\n\t      Manage hooks. add (message, post names_group, names_nick,\n\t      chatstate), remove, run\n\n       $widget names args\n\t      Passthrough to the name display text widget.
