If any\n       exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See\n       \"Reporting Bugs\" below.\n\nModules and Pragmata\n   Updated Modules and Pragmata\n       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 5.20170922_26 to\n\t   5.20180414_26.\n\n       •   PerlIO::via has been upgraded from version 0.16 to 0.17.\n\n       •   Term::ReadLine has been upgraded from version 1.16 to 1.17.\n\n       •   Unicode::UCD has been upgraded from version 0.68 to 0.69.\n\nDocumentation\n   Changes to Existing Documentation\n       perluniprops\n\n       •   This has been updated to note that \"\\p{Word}\" now includes code\n\t   points matching the \"\\p{Join_Control}\" property.  The change to the\n\t   property was made in Perl 5.18, but not documented until now.\n\t   There are currently only two code points that match this property:\n\t   U+200C (ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER) and U+200D (ZERO WIDTH JOINER).\n\nPlatform Support\n   Platform-Specific Notes\n       Windows\n\t   Visual C++ compiler version detection has been improved to work on\n\t   non-English language systems.  [GH #16235]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16235>\n\n\t   We now set $Config{libpth} correctly for 64-bit builds using Visual\n\t   C++ versions earlier than 14.1.  [GH #16269]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16269>\n\nSelected Bug Fixes\n       •   The \"readpipe()\" built-in function now checks at compile time that\n\t   it has only one parameter expression, and puts it in scalar\n\t   context, thus ensuring that it doesn't corrupt the stack at\n\t   runtime.  [GH #2793] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/2793>\n\n       •   Fixed a use after free bug in \"pp_list\" introduced in Perl 5.27.1.\n\t   [GH #16124] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16124>\n\n       •   Parsing a \"sub\" definition could cause a use after free if the\n\t   \"sub\" keyword was followed by whitespace including newlines (and\n\t   comments).  [GH #16097]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16097>\n\n       •   The tokenizer now correctly adjusts a parse pointer when skipping\n\t   whitespace in an \" ${identifier} \" construct.  [perl #131949]\n\t   <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131949>\n\n       •   Accesses to \"${^LAST_FH}\" no longer assert after using any of a\n\t   variety of I/O operations on a non-glob.  [GH #15372]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15372>\n\n       •   \"sort\" now performs correct reference counting when aliasing $a and\n\t   $b, thus avoiding premature destruction and leakage of scalars if\n\t   they are re-aliased during execution of the sort comparator.  [GH\n\t   #11422] <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/11422>\n\n       •   Some convoluted kinds of regexp no longer cause an arithmetic\n\t   overflow when compiled.  [GH #16113]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16113>\n\n       •   Fixed a duplicate symbol failure with -flto -mieee-fp builds.  pp.c\n\t   defined \"_LIB_VERSION\" which -lieee already defines.  [GH #16086]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16086>\n\n       •   A NULL pointer dereference in the \"S_regmatch()\" function has been\n\t   fixed.  [perl #132017]\n\t   <https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=132017>\n\n       •   Failures while compiling code within other constructs, such as with\n\t   string interpolation and the right part of \"s///e\" now cause\n\t   compilation to abort earlier.\n\n\t   Previously compilation could continue in order to report other\n\t   errors, but the failed sub-parse could leave partly parsed\n\t   constructs on the parser shift-reduce stack, confusing the parser,\n\t   leading to perl crashes.  [GH #14739]\n\t   <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14739>\n\nAcknowledgements\n       Perl 5.26.2 represents approximately 7 months of development since Perl\n       5.26.1 and contains approximately 3,300 lines of changes across 82\n       files from 17 authors.\n\n       Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there\n       were approximately 1,800 lines of changes to 36 .pm, .t, .c and .h\n       files.\n\n       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant\n       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to\n       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.26.2:\n\n       Aaron Crane, Abigail, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, H.Merijn Brand, James E\n       Keenan, Jarkko Hietaniemi, John SJ Anderson, Karen Etheridge, Karl\n       Williamson, Lukas Mai, Renee Baecker, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Todd\n       Rinaldo, Tony Cook, Yves Orton, Zefram.\n\n       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically\n       generated from version control history.\tIn particular, it does not\n       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who\n       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.\n\n       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN\n       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN\n       community for helping Perl to flourish.\n\n       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,\n       please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.\n\nReporting Bugs\n       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug\n       database at <https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at\n       <http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.\n\n       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug\n       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a\n       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output\n       of \"perl -V\", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by\n       the Perl porting team.\n\n       If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it\n       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see\n       \"SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION\" in perlsec for details of\n       how to report the issue.\n\nGive Thanks\n       If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in\n       Perl 5, you can do so by running the \"perlthanks\" program:\n\n\t   perlthanks\n\n       This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of\n       thanks.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for an explanation of how to view exhaustive details\n       on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t      PERL5262DELTA(1)"
