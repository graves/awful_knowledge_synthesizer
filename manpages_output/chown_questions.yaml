Symbolic links named by arguments are silently left\n     unchanged unless -h is used.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -H      If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the command line\n\t     are followed and hence unaffected by the command.\t(Symbolic\n\t     links encountered during traversal are not followed.)\n\n     -L      If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.\n\n     -P      If the -R option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.\n\t     Instead, the user and/or group ID of the link itself are\n\t     modified.\tThis is the default.  For matching behavior when using\n\t     chown without the -R option, the -h option should be used\n\t     instead."

If the group operand is specified, it must be preceded by a\n     colon (``:'') character.\n\n     The owner may be either a numeric user ID or a user name.\tIf a user name\n     is also a numeric user ID, the operand is used as a user name.

This has been changed to be a colon (``:'')\n     character so that user and group names may contain the dot character."
