The utility uses IO\n       strategies and multi-threading techniques that exploit the Xsan IO\n       model.\n\n       cvcp can work in many modes;\n\n       Directory-to-directory copies of regular files.\n       Directory copy of regular files to a Vtape virtual sub-directory.\n       Single File-to-File copy.\n\n       In terms of functionality for regular files, cvcp is much like the\n       tar(1) utility. However, when copying a directory to a Vtape virtual\n       directory, cvcp can rename and renumber the source images as they are\n       being transferred. The files in the Source directory must have a\n       decipherable numeric sequence embedded in their names.\n\n       The cvcp utility was written to provide high performance data movement,\n       therefore, unlike utilities such as rsync, it does not write data to\n       temporary files or manipulate the target files' modification times to\n       allow recovery of partially-copied files when interrupted.  Because of\n       this, cvcp may leave partially-copied files if interrupted by signals\n       such as SIGINT, SIGTERM, or SIGHUP.  Partially-copied target files will\n       be of the same size as source files; however, the data will be only\n       partially copied into them.\n\nOPTIONS\n       The Source parameter determines whether to copy a single file  or use a\n       directory scan.\tSource must be a directory or file name.\n\n       Using cvcp for directory copies is best accomplished by cd'ing to the\n       Source directory and using the dot (.) as the Source. This has been\n       shown to improve performance since fewer paths are searched in the\n       directory tree scan.\n\n       The Destination parameter determines the target file or directory.\n\nUSAGE\n       -a     Archive mode. Preserve the original permissions, owner/group,\n\t      modification times and links. This is the same as options w, x,\n\t      y and z.\n\n       -A     If specified, will turn off the pre-allocation feature. This\n\t      feature looks at the size of the source file and then makes an\n\t      ALLOCSPACE call to the file system. This pre-allocation is a\n\t      performance advantage as the file will only contain a single\n\t      extent. It also promotes volume space savings since files that\n\t      are dynamically expanded do so in a  more coarse manner. Up to\n\t      30% savings in physical disk space can be seen using the pre-\n\t      allocation feature. NOTE: Non-Xsan file systems that do not\n\t      support pre-allocation will turn pre-allocation off when\n\t      writing. The default is to have the pre-allocation feature on.\n\n       -b buffers\n\t      Set the number of IO buffers to buffers. The default is two\n\t      times the number of copy threads started(see the -t option).\n\t      Experimenting with other values between 1 and 2 times the number\n\t      of copy threads may yield performance improvements.\n\n       -B     When specified, this option disables the bulk create\n\t      optimization.  By default, this optimization is used in certain\n\t      cases to improve performance.  In some circumstances, the use of\n\t      bulk create can cause cvcp to return errors if the destination\n\t      file system is StorNext and the FSM process exits ungracefully\n\t      while a copy is in progress.  The use of the -B option avoids\n\t      this potentiality at the cost of performance.  The effect on\n\t      performance will depend on whether bulk create is being disabled\n\t      for other reasons as well as the size of the files with the\n\t      impact being more observable when small files are copied.\n\n       -c     When specified, if cvcp fails to copy a file it reports an error\n\t      and continues.\n\n       -d     Changes directory-to-directory mode to work more like cp -R.\n\t      Without -d, cvcp copies the files and sub-directories under\n\t      Source to the Destination directory.  With -d, cvcp first\n\t      creates a sub-directory called Source in the Destination\n\t      directory, then copies the files and sub-directories under\n\t      Source to that new sub-directory.\n\n       -k buffer_size\n\t      Set the IO buffer size to buffer_size bytes.  The default buffer\n\t      size is 4MB.\n\n       -l     If set, when in directory to directory mode, follow symbolic\n\t      links instead of copying the symbolic link.\n\n       -n     If set, do not recurse into any sub-directories.\n\n       -p source_prefix\n\t      If set, only copy files whose beginning file name characters\n\t      match source_prefix. The matching test only checks starting at\n\t      character one.\n\n       -s     The -s option forces allocations to line up on the beginning\n\t      block modulus of the storage pool. This can help performance in\n\t      situations where the I/O size perfectly spans the width of the\n\t      storage pool's disks.\n\n       -t num_threads\n\t      Set the number of copy threads to num_threads. The default is 4\n\t      copy threads.  This option may have a significant impact on\n\t      speed and resource consumption.  The total copy buffer pool size\n\t      is calculated by multiplying the number of buffers(-b) by the\n\t      buffer size(-k). Experimenting with the -t option along with the\n\t      -b and -k options are encouraged.\n\n       -u     Update only. If set, copies only when the source file is newer\n\t      than the destination file or the destination file does not\n\t      exist.  The file modification time check uses a granularity of\n\t      one second on Windows and microseconds on other platforms.  This\n\t      makes it possible for a slightly newer source file to not be\n\t      copied over an older destination file even though -u is used. -u\n\t      cannot be used with tar files.\n\n       -v     Be verbose about the files being copied. May be specified twice\n\t      for extreme verbosity.\n\n       -w     If set, when in file to file mode, copy a symbolic link instead\n\t      of following the link.\n\n       -x     If set, ignore umask(1) and retain original permissions from the\n\t      source file. If the super-user, set sticky and setuid/gid bits\n\t      as well.\n\n       -y     If set, preserve ownership and group information if possible.\n\n       -z     If set, retain original modification times.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Copy directory abc and its sub-directories to directory /usr/clips/foo.\n       This copy will use the default number of copy threads and buffers. The\n       total buffer pool size will total 32MB (8 buffers @ 4MB each).\n\n       Retain all permissions and ownerships. Show all files being copied.\n\n\t  rock% cvcp -vxy abc /usr/clips/foo\n\n       Copy the same directory the same way, but only those files that start\n       with mumblypeg.\n\n\t  rock# cvcp -vxy -p mumblypeg abc /usr/clips/foo\n\n       Copy a single file def to the directory /usr/clips/foo/\n\n\t  rock# cvcp def /usr/clips/foo\n\n       Copy a file sequence in the current directory prefixed with secta.\n       Place the files into the Vtape /usr/clips/n8 yuv sub-directory.\tUse\n       the verbose option.\n\n\t  rock% cvcp -v -p secta . /usr/clips/n8/yuv"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `cvcp`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nCVCP TUNING\n       cvcp can be tuned to improve performance and resource utilization. By\n       adjusting the -t, -k and -b options cvcp can be optimized for any\n       number of different environments.\n\n       -t num_threads\n\t      Increasing the number of copy threads will increase the number\n\t      of concurrent copies. This option is useful when copying large\n\t      directory structures. Single file copies are not affected by the\n\t      number of copy threads.\n\n       -b buffers\n\t      The number of copy buffer should be set to a number between 1\n\t      and 3 times the number of copy threads. Increasing the number of\n\t      copy buffers increases the amount of work that is queued up\n\t      waiting for an available copy thread, but also increases\n\t      resource consumption.\n\n       -k buffer_size\n\t      The size of the copy buffer may be tuned to fit the I/O\n\t      characteristics of a copy. If files smaller than 4MB are being\n\t      copied performance may be improved by reducing the size of copy\n\t      buffers to more closely match the source file sizes.\n\n       NOTE: It is important to ensure that the resource consumption of cvcp\n       is tuned to minimize the effects of system memory pressure. On systems\n       with limited available physical memory, performance may be increased by\n       reducing the resource consumption of cvcp.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       cvfs(8)"
