When starting, if stdin is a\n     socket it assumes that it has been started by inetd(8), otherwise it\n     behaves as a daemon, forking processes for each new connection. The\n     --debug option causes kadmind to accept exactly one connection, which is\n     useful for debugging.\n\n     The kpasswdd(8) daemon is responsible for the Kerberos 5 password\n     changing protocol (used by kpasswd(1)).\n\n     This daemon should only be run on the master server, and not on any\n     slaves.\n\n     Principals are always allowed to change their own password and list their\n     own principal.  Apart from that, doing any operation requires permission\n     explicitly added in the ACL file /var/heimdal/kadmind.acl.  The format of\n     this file is:"
