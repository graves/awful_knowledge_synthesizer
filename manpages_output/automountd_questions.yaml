The automountd is started on\n     demand by launchd(8).  As the daemon is launched by launchd, the options\n     below would be specified in the ProgramArguments key in the launchd plist\n     for automountd.  See FILES below.\n\nOPTIONS\n     -v      Log to syslogd(8) more detailed information about actions taken\n\t     by automountd.\n\n     -n      Disable browsing of all maps.\n\n     -T      Increase by 1 the logging level for messages printed to the\n\t     standard output information about requests received from autofs,\n\t     processing done for those requests, and replies sent to autofs.\n\t     The default level of 0 causes no information to be logged; each\n\t     higher value causes more information to be logged."
