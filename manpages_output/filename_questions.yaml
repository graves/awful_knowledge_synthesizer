On each platform, Tcl supports file names in the\n       standard forms(s) for that platform.  In addition, on all platforms,\n       Tcl supports a Unix-like syntax intended to provide a convenient way of\n       constructing simple file names.\tHowever, scripts that are intended to\n       be portable should not assume a particular form for file names.\n       Instead, portable scripts must use the file split and file join\n       commands to manipulate file names (see the file manual entry for more\n       details).\n\nPATH TYPES\n       File names are grouped into three general types based on the starting\n       point for the path used to specify the file: absolute, relative, and\n       volume-relative.  Absolute names are completely qualified, giving a\n       path to the file relative to a particular volume and the root directory\n       on that volume.\tRelative names are unqualified, giving a path to the\n       file relative to the current working directory.\tVolume-relative names\n       are partially qualified, either giving the path relative to the root\n       directory on the current volume, or relative to the current directory\n       of the specified volume.  The file pathtype command can be used to\n       determine the type of a given path."

Path names\n\t\t may be relative or absolute, and file names may contain any\n\t\t character other than slash.  The file names . and .. are\n\t\t special and refer to the current directory and the parent of\n\t\t the current directory respectively.  Multiple adjacent slash\n\t\t characters are interpreted as a single separator.  Any number\n\t\t of trailing slash characters at the end of a path are simply\n\t\t ignored, so the paths foo, foo/ and foo// are all identical,\n\t\t and in particular foo/ does not necessarily mean a directory\n\t\t is being referred.\n\n\t\t The following examples illustrate various forms of path\n\t\t names:\n\n\t\t /\t\tAbsolute path to the root directory.\n\n\t\t /etc/passwd\tAbsolute path to the file named passwd in the\n\t\t\t\tdirectory etc in the root directory."

Drive-relative\n\t\t names consist of an optional drive specifier followed by an\n\t\t absolute or relative path.

If a file name starts with a tilde, then\n       the file name will be interpreted as if the first element is replaced\n       with the location of the home directory for the given user.  If the\n       tilde is followed immediately by a separator, then the $HOME\n       environment variable is substituted.  Otherwise the characters between\n       the tilde and the next separator are taken as a user name, which is\n       used to retrieve the user's home directory for substitution.  This\n       works on Unix, MacOS X and Windows (except very old releases)."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `filename`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nOld Windows platforms do not support tilde substitution when a user\n       name follows the tilde.\tOn these platforms, attempts to use a tilde\n       followed by a user name will generate an error that the user does not\n       exist when Tcl attempts to interpret that part of the path or otherwise\n       access the file.  The behaviour of these paths when not trying to\n       interpret them is the same as on Unix.  File names that have a tilde\n       without a user name will be correctly substituted using the $HOME\n       environment variable, just like for Unix.\n\nPORTABILITY ISSUES\n       Not all file systems are case sensitive, so scripts should avoid code\n       that depends on the case of characters in a file name.  In addition,\n       the character sets allowed on different devices may differ, so scripts\n       should choose file names that do not contain special characters like:\n       <>:?\"/\\|.  The safest approach is to use names consisting of\n       alphanumeric characters only.  Care should be taken with filenames\n       which contain spaces (common on Windows systems) and filenames where\n       the backslash is the directory separator (Windows native path names).\n       Also Windows 3.1 only supports file names with a root of no more than 8\n       characters and an extension of no more than 3 characters."
