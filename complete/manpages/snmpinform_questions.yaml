One or more object identifiers\n       (OIDs) can be given as arguments on the command line.  A type and a\n       value must accompany each object identifier.  Each variable name is\n       given in the format specified in variables(5).\n\n       When invoked as snmpinform, or when -Ci is added to the command line\n       flags of snmptrap, it sends an INFORM-PDU, expecting a response from\n       the trap receiver, retransmitting if required.  Otherwise it sends an\n       TRAP-PDU or TRAP2-PDU."
