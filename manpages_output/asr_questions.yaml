    Manpage text:

    source and target can be /dev entries or volume mountpoints. For more
         information on restoring to or from APFS filesystems, see the RESTORING
         WITH APFS FILESYSTEMS section below.  If restoring a multicast disk image
         to a file, file can be a path to a local file or directory. If the
         specified path is a file, the disk image is given the specified name. If
         a directory, the name of the disk image being multicast is used. When
         specifying server, source has to be a UDIF disk image. Restoring from a
         multicast stream is accomplished by passing a asr:// url as source.

         When restoring APFS volumes, asr supports restoring snapshots from the
         source volume, as well as restoring snapshot deltas.  See the RESTORING
         WITH APFS SNAPSHOTS section below.

         asr supports restoring systems with a Read-Only System Volume (ROSV).
         For more information, see the RESTORING WITH READ-ONLY SYSTEM VOLUMES
         section below.

         asr needs to be run as root (see sudo(8)) in order to accomplish its
         tasks.

    HFS+ can be used as the source of a block copy to either an HFS+ or HFSX
         destination.  However, an HFSX source can only be used to block copy to

         occur when converting from an HFSX filesystem to HFS+.

         Certain non-HFS+/HFSX filesystems will block copy restore, but the target
         partition will be resized to match the size of the source image/partition
         size, with no filesystem resizing occurring.
