Each log file is named after the queue file that it\n       corresponds to, and is kept in a queue subdirectory named after the\n       service name in the master.cf file (either bounce, defer or trace).\n       This program expects to be run from the master(8) process manager.\n\n       The bounce(8) daemon processes two types of service requests:\n\n       •      Append a recipient (non-)delivery status record to a per-message\n\t      log file.\n\n       •      Enqueue a delivery status notification message, with a copy of a\n\t      per-message log file and of the corresponding message.  When the\n\t      delivery status notification message is enqueued successfully,\n\t      the per-message log file is deleted.\n\n       The software does a best notification effort. A non-delivery\n       notification is sent even when the log file or the original message\n       cannot be read.\n\n       Optionally, a bounce (defer, trace) client can request that the\n       per-message log file be deleted when the requested operation fails.\n       This is used by clients that cannot retry transactions by themselves,\n       and that depend on retry logic in their own client.\n\nSTANDARDS\n       RFC 822 (ARPA Internet Text Messages)\n       RFC 2045 (Format of Internet Message Bodies)\n       RFC 2822 (Internet Message Format)\n       RFC 3462 (Delivery Status Notifications)\n       RFC 3464 (Delivery Status Notifications)\n       RFC 3834 (Auto-Submitted: message header)\n       RFC 5322 (Internet Message Format)\n       RFC 6531 (Internationalized SMTP)\n       RFC 6532 (Internationalized Message Format)\n       RFC 6533 (Internationalized Delivery Status Notifications)\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically, as bounce(8) processes\n       run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command \"postfix reload\"\n       to speed up a change.\n\n       The text below provides only a parameter summary.
