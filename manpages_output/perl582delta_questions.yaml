- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perl582delta`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPERL582DELTA(1)        Perl Programmers Reference Guide        PERL582DELTA(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       perl582delta - what is new for perl v5.8.2\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This document describes differences between the 5.8.1 release and the\n       5.8.2 release.\n\n       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.6.1, first read\n       the perl58delta, which describes differences between 5.6.0 and 5.8.0,\n       and the perl581delta, which describes differences between 5.8.0 and\n       5.8.1.\n\nIncompatible Changes\n       For threaded builds for modules calling certain re-entrant system\n       calls, binary compatibility was accidentally lost between 5.8.0 and\n       5.8.1.  Binary compatibility with 5.8.0 has been restored in 5.8.2,\n       which necessitates breaking compatibility with 5.8.1. We see this as\n       the lesser of two evils.\n\n       This will only affect people who have a threaded perl 5.8.1, and\n       compiled modules which use these calls, and now attempt to run the\n       compiled modules with 5.8.2. The fix is to re-compile and re-install\n       the modules using 5.8.2.\n\nCore Enhancements\n   Hash Randomisation\n       The hash randomisation introduced with 5.8.1 has been amended. It\n       transpired that although the implementation introduced in 5.8.1 was\n       source compatible with 5.8.0, it was not binary compatible in certain\n       cases. 5.8.2 contains an improved implementation which is both source\n       and binary compatible with both 5.8.0 and 5.8.1, and remains robust\n       against the form of attack which prompted the change for 5.8.1.\n\n       We are grateful to the Debian project for their input in this area.\n       See \"Algorithmic Complexity Attacks\" in perlsec for the original\n       rationale behind this change.\n\n   Threading\n       Several memory leaks associated with variables shared between threads\n       have been fixed.\n\nModules and Pragmata\n   Updated Modules And Pragmata\n       The following modules and pragmata have been updated since Perl 5.8.1:\n\n       Devel::PPPort\n       Digest::MD5\n       I18N::LangTags\n       libnet\n       MIME::Base64\n       Pod::Perldoc\n       strict\n\t   Documentation improved\n\n       Tie::Hash\n\t   Documentation improved\n\n       Time::HiRes\n       Unicode::Collate\n       Unicode::Normalize\n       UNIVERSAL\n\t   Documentation improved\n\nSelected Bug Fixes\n       Some syntax errors involving unrecognized filetest operators are now\n       handled correctly by the parser.\n\nChanged Internals\n       Interpreter initialization is more complete when -DMULTIPLICITY is off.\n       This should resolve problems with initializing and destroying the Perl\n       interpreter more than once in a single process.\n\nPlatform Specific Problems\n       Dynamic linker flags have been tweaked for Solaris and OS X, which\n       should solve problems seen while building some XS modules.\n\n       Bugs in OS/2 sockets and tmpfile have been fixed.\n\n       In OS X \"setreuid\" and friends are troublesome - perl will now work\n       around their problems as best possible.\n\nFuture Directions\n       Starting with 5.8.3 we intend to make more frequent maintenance\n       releases, with a smaller number of changes in each. The intent is to\n       propagate bug fixes out to stable releases more rapidly and make\n       upgrading stable releases less of an upheaval. This should give end\n       users more flexibility in their choice of upgrade timing, and allow\n       them easier assessment of the impact of upgrades. The current plan is\n       for code freezes as follows\n\n       •   5.8.3 23:59:59 GMT, Wednesday December 31st 2003\n\n       •   5.8.4 23:59:59 GMT, Wednesday March 31st 2004\n\n       •   5.8.5 23:59:59 GMT, Wednesday June 30th 2004\n\n       with the release following soon after, when testing is complete.\n\n       See \"Future Directions\" in perl581delta for more soothsaying.\n\nReporting Bugs\n       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles\n       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug\n       database at http://bugs.perl.org/.  There may also be information at\n       http://www.perl.com/, the Perl Home Page.\n\n       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug\n       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a\n       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output\n       of \"perl -V\", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by\n       the Perl porting team.  You can browse and search the Perl 5 bugs at\n       http://bugs.perl.org/\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for exhaustive details on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t       PERL582DELTA(1)"
