When\n\t   $a is executed, the \"eval '$x'\" causes the chain of \"CvOUTSIDE\"s to\n\t   be followed, and the freed BEGIN is accessed.\n\n\t   To avoid this, whenever a CV and its associated pad is freed, any\n\t   \"&\" entries in the pad are explicitly removed from the pad, and if\n\t   the refcount of the pointed-to anon sub is still positive, then\n\t   that child's \"CvOUTSIDE\" is set to point to its grandparent.

A\n\t   handful of attributes take effect by built-in means, being applied\n\t   to \"PL_compcv\" immediately when seen.  Other attributes are\n\t   collected up and attached to the subroutine by this route.  \"attrs\"\n\t   may be null to supply no attributes, or point to a \"const\" op for a\n\t   single attribute, or point to a \"list\" op whose children apart from\n\t   the \"pushmark\" are \"const\" ops for one or more attributes.  Each\n\t   \"const\" op must be a string, giving the attribute name optionally\n\t   followed by parenthesised arguments, in the manner in which\n\t   attributes appear in Perl source.  The attributes will be applied\n\t   to the sub by this function.  \"attrs\" is consumed by this function.\n\n\t   If \"o_is_gv\" is false and \"o\" is null, then the subroutine will be\n\t   anonymous.  If \"o_is_gv\" is false and \"o\" is non-null, then \"o\"\n\t   must point to a \"const\" OP, which will be consumed by this\n\t   function, and its string value supplies a name for the subroutine.\n\t   The name may be qualified or unqualified, and if it is unqualified\n\t   then a default stash will be selected in some manner.  If \"o_is_gv\"\n\t   is true, then \"o\" doesn't point to an \"OP\" at all, but is instead a\n\t   cast pointer to a \"GV\" by which the subroutine will be named."
