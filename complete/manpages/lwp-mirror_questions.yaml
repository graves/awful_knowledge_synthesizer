The\n       document is only transferred if the remote copy is newer than the local\n       copy.  If the local copy is newer nothing happens.\n\n       Use the \"-v\" option to print the version number of this program.\n\n       The timeout value specified with the \"-t\" option.  The timeout value is\n       the time that the program will wait for response from the remote server\n       before it fails.  The default unit for the timeout value is seconds.\n       You might append \"m\" or \"h\" to the timeout value to make it minutes or\n       hours, respectively.\n\n       Because this program is implemented using the LWP library, it only\n       supports the protocols that LWP supports.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       lwp-request, LWP\n\nAUTHOR\n       Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>\n\nperl v5.34.0\t\t\t  2020-04-14\t\t\t LWP-MIRROR(1)"
