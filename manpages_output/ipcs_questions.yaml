The “maximum allowed size”\n\t     is the maximum number of bytes in a message on a message queue,\n\t     the size of a shared memory segment, or the number of semaphores\n\t     in a set of semaphores.\n\n     -c      Show the creator's name and group for active semaphores, message\n\t     queues, and shared memory segments."
