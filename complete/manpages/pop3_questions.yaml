It works by opening the standard POP3\n       socket on the server, transmitting the username and password, then\n       providing a Tcl API to access the POP3 protocol commands.  All server\n       errors are returned as Tcl errors (thrown) which must be caught with\n       the Tcl catch command.\n\nAPI\n       ::pop3::open ?-msex 0|1? ?-retr-mode retr|list|slow? ?-socketcmd\n       cmdprefix? host username password ?port?\n\t      Open a socket connection to the server specified by host,\n\t      transmit the username and password as login information to the\n\t      server.  The default port number is 110, which can be overridden\n\t      using the optional port argument.  The return value is a channel\n\t      used by all of the other ::pop3 functions.\n\n\t      The command recognizes three options\n\n\t      -msex boolean\n\t\t     Setting this option tells the package that the server we\n\t\t     are talking to is an MS Exchange server (which has some\n\t\t     oddities we have to work around). The default is False.\n\n\t      -retr-mode retr|list|slow\n\t\t     The retrieval mode determines how exactly messages are\n\t\t     read from the server.  The allowed values are retr, list\n\t\t     and slow.\tThe default is retr. See ::pop3::retrieve for\n\t\t     more information.\n\n\t      -socketcmd cmdprefix\n\t\t     This option allows the user to overide the use of the\n\t\t     builtin socket command with any API-compatible command.\n\t\t     The envisioned main use is the securing of the new\n\t\t     connection via SSL, through the specification of the\n\t\t     command tls::socket. This command is specially recognized\n\t\t     as well, changing the default port of the connection to\n\t\t     995.\n\n       ::pop3::config chan\n\t      Returns the configuration of the pop3 connection identified by\n\t      the channel handle chan as a serialized array.\n\n       ::pop3::status chan\n\t      Query the server for the status of the mail spool.  The status\n\t      is returned as a list containing two elements, the first is the\n\t      number of email messages on the server and the second is the\n\t      size (in octets, 8 byte blocks) of the entire mail spool.\n\n       ::pop3::last chan\n\t      Query the server for the last email message read from the spool.\n\t      This value includes all messages read from all clients\n\t      connecting to the login account.\tThis command may not be\n\t      supported by the email server, in which case the server may\n\t      return 0 or an error.\n\n       ::pop3::retrieve chan startIndex ?endIndex?\n\t      Retrieve a range of messages from the server.  If the endIndex\n\t      is not specified, only one message will be retrieved.  The\n\t      return value is a list containing each message as a separate\n\t      element.\tSee the startIndex and endIndex descriptions below.\n\n\t      The retrieval mode determines how exactly messages are read from\n\t      the server. The mode retr assumes that the RETR command delivers\n\t      the size of the message as part of the command status and uses\n\t      this to read the message efficiently. In mode list RETR does not\n\t      deliver the size, but the LIST command does and we use this to\n\t      retrieve the message size before the actual retrieval, which can\n\t      then be done efficiently. In the last mode, slow, the system is\n\t      unable to obtain the size of the message to retrieve in any\n\t      manner and falls back to reading the message from the server\n\t      line by line.\n\n\t      It should also be noted that the system checks upon the\n\t      configured mode and falls back to the slower modes if the above\n\t      assumptions are not true.\n\n       ::pop3::delete chan startIndex ?endIndex?\n\t      Delete a range of messages from the server.  If the endIndex is\n\t      not specified, only one message will be deleted.\tNote, the\n\t      indices are not reordered on the server, so if you delete\n\t      message 1, then the first message in the queue is message 2\n\t      (message index 1 is no longer valid).  See the startIndex and\n\t      endIndex descriptions below.\n\n\t      startIndex\n\t\t     The startIndex may be an index of a specific message\n\t\t     starting with the index 1, or it have any of the\n\t\t     following values:\n\n\t\t     start  This is a logical value for the first message in\n\t\t\t    the spool, equivalent to the value 1.\n\n\t\t     next   The message immediately following the last message\n\t\t\t    read, see ::pop3::last.\n\n\t\t     end    The most recent message in the spool (the end of\n\t\t\t    the spool).  This is useful to retrieve only the\n\t\t\t    most recent message.\n\n\t      endIndex\n\t\t     The endIndex is an optional parameter and defaults to the\n\t\t     value \"-1\", which indicates to only retrieve the one\n\t\t     message specified by startIndex.  If specified, it may be\n\t\t     an index of a specific message starting with the index\n\t\t     \"1\", or it may have any of the following values:\n\n\t\t     last   The message is the last message read by a POP3\n\t\t\t    client, see ::pop3::last.\n\n\t\t     end    The most recent message in the spool (the end of\n\t\t\t    the spool).\n\n       ::pop3::list chan ?msg?\n\t      Returns the scan listing of the mailbox. If parameter msg is\n\t      given, then the listing only for that message is returned.\n\n       ::pop3::top chan msg n\n\t      Optional POP3 command, not all servers may support this.\n\t      ::pop3::top retrieves headers of a message, specified by\n\t      parameter msg, and number of n lines from the message body.\n\n       ::pop3::uidl chan ?msg?\n\t      Optional POP3 command, not all servers may support this.\n\t      ::pop3::uidl returns the uid listing of the mailbox. If the\n\t      parameter msg is specified, then the listing only for that\n\t      message is returned.\n\n       ::pop3::close chan\n\t      Gracefully close the connect after sending a POP3 QUIT command\n\t      down the socket.\n\nSECURE MAIL TRANSFER\n       A pop3 connection can be secured with SSL/TLS by requiring the package\n       TLS and then using the option -socketcmd of the command pop3::open to\n       force the use of the tls::socket command when opening the connection.\n\n\t    package require tls\n\t    tls::init -cafile /path/to/ca/cert -keyfile ...\n\n\t    # Create secured pop3 channel\n\t    pop3::open -socketcmd tls::socket \\\\\n\t\t $thehost $theuser $thepassword\n\n\t    ..."
