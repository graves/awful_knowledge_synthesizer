It is designed to work with Tcl 8.5,\n       but for Tcl 8.4 is provided an earlier version of this package.\tSee\n       WHAT ABOUT TCL 8.4 ? for more explanations.  By convention, we will\n       talk about the numbers treated in this library as :\n\n       •      BigFloat for floating-point numbers of arbitrary length.\n\n       •      integers for arbitrary length signed integers, just as basic\n\t      integers since Tcl 8.5.\n\n       Each BigFloat is an interval, namely [m-d, m+d], where m is the\n       mantissa and d the uncertainty, representing the limitation of that\n       number's precision.  This is why we call such mathematics interval\n       computations.  Just take an example in physics : when you measure a\n       temperature, not all digits you read are significant. Sometimes you\n       just cannot trust all digits - not to mention if doubles (f.p. numbers)\n       can handle all these digits.  BigFloat can handle this problem -\n       trusting the digits you get - plus the ability to store numbers with an\n       arbitrary precision.  BigFloats are internally represented at Tcl\n       lists: this package provides a set of procedures operating against the\n       internal representation in order to :\n\n       •      perform math operations on BigFloats and (optionnaly) with\n\t      integers.\n\n       •      convert BigFloats from their internal representations to\n\t      strings, and vice versa.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n       fromstr number ?trailingZeros?\n\t      Converts number into a BigFloat. Its precision is at least the\n\t      number of digits provided by number.  If the number contains\n\t      only digits and eventually a minus sign, it is considered as an\n\t      integer. Subsequently, no conversion is done at all.\n\n\t      trailingZeros - the number of zeros to append at the end of the\n\t      floating-point number to get more precision. It cannot be\n\t      applied to an integer.\n\n\t      # x and y are BigFloats : the first string contained a dot, and the second an e sign\n\t      set x [fromstr -1.000000]\n\t      set y [fromstr 2000e30]\n\t      # let's see how we get integers\n\t      set t 20000000000000\n\t      # the old way (package 1.2) is still supported for backwards compatibility :\n\t      set m [fromstr 10000000000]\n\t      # but we do not need fromstr for integers anymore\n\t      set n -39\n\t      # t, m and n are integers"

However, some rounding is done, as\n\t      not doing so causes severe problems.\n\n       Uncertainties are kept in the internal representation of the number ;\n       it is recommended to use tostr only for outputting data (on the screen\n       or in a file), and NEVER call fromstr with the result of tostr.\tIt is\n       better to always keep operands in their internal representation.  Due\n       to the internals of this library, the uncertainty interval may be\n       slightly wider than expected, but this should not cause false digits.\n\n       Now you may ask this question : What precision am I going to get after\n       calling add, sub, mul or div?  First you set a number from the string\n       representation and, by the way, its uncertainty is set:\n\n       set a [fromstr 1.230]\n       # $a belongs to [1.229, 1.231]\n       set a [fromstr 1.000]\n       # $a belongs to [0.999, 1.001]\n       # $a has a relative uncertainty of 0.1% : 0.001(the uncertainty)/1.000(the medium value)\n\n       The uncertainty of the sum, or the difference, of two numbers, is the\n       sum of their respective uncertainties.\n\n       set a [fromstr 1.230]\n       set b [fromstr 2.340]\n       set sum [add $a $b]]\n       # the result is : [3.568, 3.572] (the last digit is known with an uncertainty of 2)\n       tostr $sum ; # 3.57\n\n       But when, for example, we add or substract an integer to a BigFloat,\n       the relative uncertainty of the result is unchanged. So it is desirable\n       not to convert integers to BigFloats:\n\n       set a [fromstr 0.999999999]\n       # now something dangerous\n       set b [fromstr 2.000]\n       # the result has only 3 digits\n       tostr [add $a $b]\n\n       # how to keep precision at its maximum\n       puts [tostr [add $a 2]]"

    Manpage text:

    For multiplication and division, the relative uncertainties of the
           product or the quotient, is the sum of the relative uncertainties of
           the operands.  Take care of division by zero : check each divider with
           iszero.

           set num [fromstr 4.00]
           set denom [fromstr 0.01]

           puts [iszero $denom];# true
           set quotient [div $num $denom];# error : divide by zero

           # opposites of our operands
           puts [compare $num [opp $num]]; # 1
           puts [compare $denom [opp $denom]]; # 0 !!!
           # No suprise ! 0 and its opposite are the same...

           Effects of the precision of a number considered equal to zero to the

           puts [tostr [cos [fromstr 0. 10]]]; # -> 1.000000000
           puts [tostr [cos [fromstr 0. 5]]]; # -> 1.0000
           puts [tostr [cos [fromstr 0e-10]]]; # -> 1.000000000
           puts [tostr [cos [fromstr 1e-10]]]; # -> 1.000000000

           BigFloats with different internal representations may be converted to
           the same string.

           For most analysis functions (cosine, square root, logarithm, etc.),
           determining the precision of the result is difficult.  It seems however
           that in many cases, the loss of precision in the result is of one or
           two digits.  There are some exceptions : for example,

           tostr [exp [fromstr 100.0 10]]
           # returns : 2.688117142e+43 which has only 10 digits of precision, although the entry

    WHAT ABOUT TCL 8.4 ?
           If your setup do not provide Tcl 8.5 but supports 8.4, the package can
           still be loaded, switching back to math::bigfloat 1.2. Indeed, an
           important function introduced in Tcl 8.5 is required - the ability to
           handle bignums, that we can do with expr.  Before 8.5, this ability was
           provided by several packages, including the pure-Tcl math::bignum
           package provided by tcllib.  In this case, all you need to know, is
           that arguments to the commands explained here, are expected to be in
           their internal representation.  So even with integers, you will need to
           call fromstr and tostr in order to convert them between string and
           internal representations.
