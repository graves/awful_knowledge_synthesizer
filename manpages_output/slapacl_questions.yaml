It opens the slapd.conf(5) configuration\n       file or the slapd-config(5) backend, reads in the access/olcAccess\n       directives, and then parses the attr list given on the command-line; if\n       none is given, access to the entry pseudo-attribute is tested.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -b_DN  specify the DN which access is requested to; the corresponding\n\t      entry is fetched from the database, and thus it must exist.  The\n\t      DN is also used to determine what rules apply; thus, it must be\n\t      in the naming context of a configured database.  See also -u."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the slapacl command?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use slapacl to check access permissions for the DN 'cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com'?
  manpageQuestion3: What command would you use to verify access control for the 'userPassword' attribute with a specific authentication context?
