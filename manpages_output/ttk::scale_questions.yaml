A scale displays\n       a slider that can be moved along over a trough, with the relative\n       position of the slider over the trough indicating the value of the\n       variable.\n\nSTANDARD OPTIONS\n       -class\t\t     -cursor\t\t  -style\n       -takefocus\n\n       See the ttk_widget manual entry for details on the standard options.\n\nWIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS\n       [-command command] Specifies the prefix of a Tcl command to invoke\n       whenever the scale's value is changed via a widget command. The actual\n       command consists of this option followed by a space and a real number\n       indicating the new value of the scale.  [-from from] A real value\n       corresponding to the left or top end of the scale.  [-length length]\n       Specifies the desired long dimension of the scale in screen units (i.e.\n       any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels). For vertical scales this\n       is the scale's height; for horizontal scales it is the scale's width.\n       [-orient orient] Specifies which orientation whether the widget should\n       be laid out horizontally or vertically. Must be either horizontal or\n       vertical or an abbreviation of one of these.  [-to to] Specifies a real\n       value corresponding to the right or bottom end of the scale.  This\n       value may be either less than or greater than the from option.\n       [-value value] Specifies the current floating-point value of the\n       variable.  [-variable variable] Specifies the name of a global variable\n       to link to the scale. Whenever the value of the variable changes, the\n       scale will update to reflect this value.  Whenever the scale is\n       manipulated interactively, the variable will be modified to reflect the\n       scale's new value."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the ttk::scale widget?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you create a horizontal scale widget that allows users to adjust the value of a variable called 'volume' between 0 and 100?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using ttk::scale to create a vertical scale that links to a variable named 'brightness' and has a length of 200 pixels?
