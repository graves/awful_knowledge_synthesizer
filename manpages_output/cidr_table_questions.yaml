These tables are\n       usually in dbm or db format.  Alternatively, lookup tables can be\n       specified in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) form. In this case,\n       each input is compared against a list of patterns. When a match is\n       found, the corresponding result is returned and the search is\n       terminated.\n\n       To find out what types of lookup tables your Postfix system supports\n       use the \"postconf -m\" command.\n\n       To test lookup tables, use the \"postmap -q\" command as described in the\n       SYNOPSIS above.\n\nTABLE FORMAT\n       The general form of a Postfix CIDR table is:\n\n       pattern\t   result\n\t      When a search string matches the specified pattern, use the\n\t      corresponding result value. The pattern must be in\n\t      network/prefix or network_address form (see ADDRESS PATTERN\n\t      SYNTAX below).\n\n       !pattern     result\n\t      When a search string does not match the specified pattern, use\n\t      the specified result value. The pattern must be in\n\t      network/prefix or network_address form (see ADDRESS PATTERN\n\t      SYNTAX below).\n\n\t      This feature is available in Postfix 3.2 and later.\n\n       if pattern\n\n       endif  When a search string matches the specified pattern, match that\n\t      search string against the patterns between if and endif.\tThe\n\t      pattern must be in network/prefix or network_address form (see\n\t      ADDRESS PATTERN SYNTAX below). The if..endif can nest.\n\n\t      Note: do not prepend whitespace to text between if..endif.\n\n\t      This feature is available in Postfix 3.2 and later.\n\n       if !pattern\n\n       endif  When a search string does not match the specified pattern, match\n\t      that search string against the patterns between if and endif.\n\t      The pattern must be in network/prefix or network_address form\n\t      (see ADDRESS PATTERN SYNTAX below). The if..endif can nest.\n\n\t      Note: do not prepend whitespace to text between if..endif.\n\n\t      This feature is available in Postfix 3.2 and later.\n\n       blank lines and comments\n\t      Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as are lines\n\t      whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.\n\n       multi-line text\n\t      A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that\n\t      starts with whitespace continues a logical line.\n\nTABLE SEARCH ORDER\n       Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a\n       pattern is found that matches the search string.\n\nADDRESS PATTERN SYNTAX\n       Postfix CIDR tables are pattern-based. A pattern is either a\n       network_address which requires an exact match, or a\n       network_address/prefix_length where the prefix_length part specifies\n       the length of the network_address prefix that must be matched (the\n       other bits in the network_address part must be zero).\n\n       An IPv4 network address is a sequence of four decimal octets separated\n       by \".\", and an IPv6 network address is a sequence of three to eight\n       hexadecimal octet pairs separated by \":\" or \"::\", where the latter is\n       short-hand for a sequence of one or more all-zero octet pairs. The\n       pattern 0.0.0.0/0 matches every IPv4 address, and ::/0 matches every\n       IPv6 address.  IPv6 support is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.\n\n       Before comparisons are made, lookup keys and table entries are\n       converted from string to binary. Therefore, IPv6 patterns will be\n       matched regardless of leading zeros (a leading zero in an IPv4 address\n       octet indicates octal notation).\n\n       Note: address information may be enclosed inside \"[]\" but this form is\n       not required.\n\nEXAMPLE SMTPD ACCESS MAP\n       /etc/postfix/main.cf:\n\t   smtpd_client_restrictions = ... cidr:/etc/postfix/client.cidr ...\n\n       /etc/postfix/client.cidr:\n\t   # Rule order matters. Put more specific whitelist entries\n\t   # before more general blacklist entries.\n\t   192.168.1.1\t\t   OK\n\t   192.168.0.0/16\t   REJECT\n\t   2001:db8::1\t\t   OK\n\t   2001:db8::/32\t   REJECT\n\nSEE ALSO\n       postmap(1), Postfix lookup table manager\n       regexp_table(5), format of regular expression tables\n       pcre_table(5), format of PCRE tables\n\nREADME FILES\n       Use \"postconf readme_directory\" or \"postconf html_directory\" to locate\n       this information.\n       DATABASE_README, Postfix lookup table overview\n\nHISTORY\n       CIDR table support was introduced with Postfix version 2.1.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n       The CIDR table lookup code was originally written by:\n       Jozsef Kadlecsik\n       KFKI Research Institute for Particle and Nuclear Physics\n       POB. 49\n       1525 Budapest, Hungary\n\n       Adopted and adapted by:\n       Wietse Venema\n       IBM T.J.
