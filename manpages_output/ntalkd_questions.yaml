In normal operation, a client, the caller,\n     initiates a rendezvous by sending a CTL_MSG to the server of type LOOK_UP\n     (see <protocols/talkd.h>).  This causes the server to search its\n     invitation tables to check if an invitation currently exists for the\n     caller (to speak to the callee specified in the message).\n\n     If the lookup fails, the caller then sends an ANNOUNCE message causing\n     the server to broadcast an announcement on the callee's login ports\n     requesting contact.\n\n     When the callee responds, the local server uses the recorded invitation\n     to respond with the appropriate rendezvous address and the caller and\n     callee client programs establish a stream connection through which the\n     conversation takes place."
