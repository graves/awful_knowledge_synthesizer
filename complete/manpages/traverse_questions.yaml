The main command exported by the package is:\n\n       ::fileutil::traverse ?objectName? path ?option value...?\n\t      The command creates a new traversal object with an associated\n\t      global Tcl command whose name is objectName. This command may be\n\t      used to invoke various operations on the traverser.  If the\n\t      string %AUTO% is used as the objectName then a unique name will\n\t      be generated by the package itself."

Note that\n\t      all these options can be set only during the creation of the\n\t      traversal object. Changing them later is not possible and causes\n\t      errors to be thrown if attempted.\n\n\t      The object command has the following general form:\n\n\t      $traverser command ?arg arg ...?\n\t\t     Command and its arguments determine the exact behavior of\n\t\t     the object.\n\n       The following commands are possible for traversal objects:\n\n       $traverser files\n\t      This method is the most highlevel one provided by traversal\n\t      objects. When invoked it returns a list containing the names of\n\t      all files and directories matching the current configuration of\n\t      the traverser.\n\n       $traverser foreach filevar script\n\t      The highlevel files method (see above) is based on this mid-\n\t      level method. When invoked it finds all files and directories\n\t      matching per the current configuration and executes the script\n\t      for each path. The current path under consideration is stored in\n\t      the variable named by filevar. Both variable and script live /\n\t      are executed in the context of the caller of the method. In the\n\t      method files the script simply saves the found paths into the\n\t      list to return."

When invoked it returns a\n\t      boolean value indicating whether it found a path matching the\n\t      current configuration (True), or not (False). If a path was\n\t      found it is stored into the variable named by filevar, in the\n\t      context of the caller.  The foreach method simply calls this\n\t      method in a loop until it returned False. This method is exposed\n\t      so that we are also able to incrementally traverse a directory\n\t      hierarchy in an event-based manner.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -prefilter command_prefix\n\t      This callback is executed for directories. Its result determines\n\t      if the traverser recurses into the directory or not. The default\n\t      is to always recurse into all directories. The callback is\n\t      invoked with a single argument, the absolute path of the\n\t      directory, and has to return a boolean value, True when the\n\t      directory passes the filter, and False if not."

Like being unable to change into them, get their\n\t      status, etc. The default is to ignore any such problems. The\n\t      callback is invoked with a two arguments, the absolute path for\n\t      which the error occured, and the error message.
