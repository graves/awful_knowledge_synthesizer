Therefore, there can be four\n     possible configurations.  The behavior of gif is mainly based on RFC2893\n     IPv6-over-IPv4 configured tunnel.\tOn NetBSD, gif can also tunnel ISO\n     traffic over IPv[46] using EON encapsulation.\n\n     Each gif interface is created at runtime using interface cloning.\tThis\n     is done with the ifconfig(8) create command.\n\n     To use gif, administrator needs to configure protocol and addresses used\n     for the outer header.  This can be done by using the SIOCSIFPHYADDR\n     ioctl.  Also, administrator needs to configure protocol and addresses\n     used for the inner header, by using ifconfig(8).  Note that IPv6 link-\n     local address (those start with fe80::) will be automatically configured\n     whenever possible.  You may need to remove IPv6 link-local address\n     manually using ifconfig(8), when you would like to disable the use of\n     IPv6 as inner header (like when you need pure IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel).\n     Finally, use routing table to route the packets toward gif interface."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `gif`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\ngif can be configured to be ECN friendly.\tThis can be configured by\n     IFF_LINK1.\n\n   ECN friendly behavior\n     gif can be configured to be ECN friendly, as described in\n     draft-ietf-ipsec-ecn-02.txt.  This is turned off by default, and can be\n     turned on by IFF_LINK1 interface flag.\n\n     Without IFF_LINK1, gif will show a normal behavior, like described in\n     RFC2893.  This can be summarized as follows:\n\n\t   Ingress  Set outer TOS bit to 0.\n\n\t   Egress   Drop outer TOS bit.\n\n     With IFF_LINK1, gif will copy ECN bits (0x02 and 0x01 on IPv4 TOS byte or\n     IPv6 traffic class byte) on egress and ingress, as follows:\n\n\t   Ingress  Copy TOS bits except for ECN CE (masked with 0xfe) from\n\t\t    inner to outer.  Set ECN CE bit to 0.\n\n\t   Egress   Use inner TOS bits with some change.  If outer ECN CE bit\n\t\t    is 1, enable ECN CE bit on the inner.\n\n     Note that the ECN friendly behavior violates RFC2893.  This should be\n     used in mutual agreement with the peer.\n\n   Security\n     Malicious party may try to circumvent security filters by using tunnelled\n     packets.  For better protection, gif performs martian filter and ingress\n     filter against outer source address, on egress.  Note that\n     martian/ingress filters are no way complete.  You may want to secure your\n     node by using packet filters.  Ingress filter can be turned off by\n     IFF_LINK2 bit."

    Miscellaneous
         By default, gif tunnels may not be nested.  This behavior may be modified
         at runtime by setting the sysctl(8) variable net.link.gif.max_nesting to
         the desired level of nesting.  Additionally, gif tunnels are restricted
         to one per pair of end points.  Parallel tunnels may be enabled by
         setting the sysctl(8) variable net.link.gif.parallel_tunnels to 1.

    HISTORY
         The gif device first appeared in WIDE hydrangea IPv6 kit.

    BUGS
         There are many tunneling protocol specifications, defined differently
         from each other.  gif may not interoperate with peers which are based on
         different specifications, and are picky about outer header fields.  For
         example, you cannot usually use gif to talk with IPsec devices that use
         IPsec tunnel mode.

    Manpage text:

    The current code does not check if the ingress address (outer source
         address) configured to gif makes sense.  Make sure to configure an
         address which belongs to your node.  Otherwise, your node will not be
         able to receive packets from the peer, and your node will generate
         packets with a spoofed source address.

         If the outer protocol is IPv4, gif does not try to perform path MTU
         discovery for the encapsulated packet (DF bit is set to 0).

         If the outer protocol is IPv6, path MTU discovery for encapsulated packet
         may affect communication over the interface.  The first bigger-than-pmtu
         packet may be lost.  To avoid the problem, you may want to set the
         interface MTU for gif to 1240 or smaller, when outer header is IPv6 and
         inner header is IPv4.

         gif does not translate ICMP messages for outer header into inner header.

         In the past, gif had a multi-destination behavior, configurable via
         IFF_LINK0 flag.  The behavior was obsoleted and is no longer supported.
