The\n       value of the variable must be an integer.  If increment is supplied\n       then its value (which must be an integer) is added to the value of\n       variable varName;  otherwise 1 is added to varName.  The new value is\n       stored as a decimal string in variable varName and also returned as\n       result.\n\n       Starting with the Tcl 8.5 release, the variable varName passed to incr  │\n       may be unset, and in that case, it will be set to the value increment   │\n       or to the default increment value of 1.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Add one to the contents of the variable x:\n\t      incr x\n\n       Add 42 to the contents of the variable x:\n\t      incr x 42\n\n       Add the contents of the variable y to the contents of the variable x:\n\t      incr x $y\n\n       Add nothing at all to the variable x (often useful for checking whether\n       an argument to a procedure is actually integral and generating an error\n       if it is not):\n\t      incr x 0"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the incr command in Tcl?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the incr command to increment the value of a variable named 'count' by 5?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the incr command to increment a variable that was previously unset?
