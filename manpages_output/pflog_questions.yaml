Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `pflog`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPFLOG(4)\t\t     Device Drivers Manual\t\t      PFLOG(4)\n\nNAME\n     pflog â€“ packet filter logging interface\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     pseudo-device pflog\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The pflog interface is a pseudo-device which makes visible all packets\n     logged by the packet filter.  Logged packets can easily be monitored in\n     real time by invoking tcpdump(1) on the pflog interface.\n\n     Instances of the pflog interface can be created using ifconfig(8).\n\nEXAMPLES\n     Create a pflog interface and monitor all packets logged on it:\n\n\t   # ifconfig pflog1 create\n\t   # tcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog1\n\nSEE ALSO\n     inet(4), inet6(4), netintro(4), pf(4), ifconfig(8), tcpdump(1)\n\nHISTORY\n     The pflog device first appeared in OpenBSD 3.0.\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t\t May 31, 2007\t\t\t    macOS 15.3"
