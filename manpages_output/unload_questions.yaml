The packageName\n       argument is the name of the package (as determined by or passed to\n       load), and is used to compute the name of the unload procedure; if not\n       supplied, it is computed from fileName in the same manner as load.  The\n       interp argument is the path name of the interpreter from which to\n       unload the package (see the interp manual entry for details); if interp\n       is omitted, it defaults to the interpreter in which the unload command\n       was invoked."

The\n       first counter shows how many times the library has been loaded into\n       normal (trusted) interpreters while the second describes how many times\n       the library has been loaded into safe interpreters. As a file\n       containing a shared library can be loaded only once by Tcl (with the\n       first load call on the file), these counters track how many\n       interpreters use the library.  Each subsequent call to load after the\n       first simply increments the proper reference count."

    Manpage text:

    unload works in the opposite direction. As a first step, unload will
           check whether the library is unloadable: an unloadable library exports
           a special unload procedure. The name of the unload procedure is
           determined by packageName and whether or not the target interpreter is
           a safe one.  For normal interpreters the name of the initialization
           procedure will have the form pkg_Unload, where pkg is the same as
           packageName except that the first letter is converted to upper case and
           all other letters are converted to lower case.  For example, if
           packageName is foo or FOo, the initialization procedure's name will be
           Foo_Unload.  If the target interpreter is a safe interpreter, then the
           name of the initialization procedure will be pkg_SafeUnload instead of
           pkg_Unload.

           If unload determines that a library is not unloadable (or unload
           functionality has been disabled during compilation), an error will be
           returned.  If the library is unloadable, then unload will call the
           unload procedure. If the unload procedure returns TCL_OK, unload will
           proceed and decrease the proper reference count (depending on the
           target interpreter type). When both reference counts have reached 0,
           the library will be detached from the process.

The unload procedure must return TCL_OK or\n       TCL_ERROR to indicate whether or not it completed successfully;\tin the\n       event of an error it should set the interpreter's result to point to an\n       error message.  In this case, the result of the unload command will be\n       the result returned by the unload procedure.\n\n       The flags argument can be either TCL_UNLOAD_DETACH_FROM_INTERPRETER or\n       TCL_UNLOAD_DETACH_FROM_PROCESS. In case the library will remain\n       attached to the process after the unload procedure returns (i.e.\n       because the library is used by other interpreters),\n       TCL_UNLOAD_DETACH_FROM_INTERPRETER will be defined. However, if the\n       library is used only by the target interpreter and the library will be\n       detached from the application as soon as the unload procedure returns,\n       the flags argument will be set to TCL_UNLOAD_DETACH_FROM_PROCESS."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `unload`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nNOTES\n       The unload command cannot unload libraries that are statically linked\n       with the application.  If fileName is an empty string, then the\n       packageName argument must be specified.\n\n       If packageName is omitted or specified as an empty string, Tcl tries to\n       guess the name of the package.  This may be done differently on\n       different platforms.  The default guess, which is used on most UNIX\n       platforms, is to take the last element of fileName, strip off the first\n       three characters if they are lib, and use any following alphabetic and\n       underline characters as the module name.  For example, the command\n       unload libxyz4.2.so uses the module name xyz and the command unload\n       bin/last.so {} uses the module name last.\n\nPORTABILITY ISSUES\n       Unix\n\t      Not all unix operating systems support library unloading. Under\n\t      such an operating system unload returns an error (unless\n\t      -nocomplain has been specified).\n\nBUGS\n       If the same file is loaded by different fileNames, it will be loaded\n       into the process's address space multiple times.  The behavior of this\n       varies from system to system (some systems may detect the redundant\n       loads, others may not). In case a library has been silently detached by\n       the operating system (and as a result Tcl thinks the library is still\n       loaded), it may be dangerous to use unload on such a library (as the\n       library will be completely detached from the application while some\n       interpreters will continue to use it)."
