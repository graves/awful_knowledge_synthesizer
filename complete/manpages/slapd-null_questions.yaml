That is,\n       it must follow a \"database null\" line and come before any subsequent\n       \"database\" lines.  Other database options are described in the\n       slapd.conf(5) manual page.\n\n       bind <on/off>\n\t      Allow binds as any DN in this backend's suffix, with any\n\t      password.  The default is \"off\"."
