If multiple\n     intervals are given, they are added together.  If the final sum is zero\n     or negative, sleep exits immediately.\n\n     If the sleep command receives a signal, it takes the standard action.\n     When the SIGINFO signal is received, the estimate of the amount of\n     seconds left to sleep is printed on the standard output.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION NOTES\n     The SIGALRM signal is not handled specially by this implementation.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The sleep utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\n\nEXAMPLES\n     To run a command after half an hour:\n\n\t   (sleep 0.5h; sh command_file >out 2>err)&"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the sleep command?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the sleep command to pause execution for 30 seconds and then run a script?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the sleep command with multiple time intervals, such as 10 minutes and 5 seconds?

See the at(1) utility for another way to do this.\n\n     To reiteratively run a command:\n\n\t   while :; do\n\t\t   if !

The script checks every five minutes for the file\n     zzz.rawdata, when the file is found, then another portion processing is\n     done courteously by sleeping for 70 seconds in between each awk(1) job.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     nanosleep(2), sleep(3)\n\nSTANDARDS\n     The sleep command is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”)\n     compatible."
