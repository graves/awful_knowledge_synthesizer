Some issues relating to the older SunOS 4.x are\n       also discussed, though they may be out of date.\n\n       For the most part, everything should just work.\n\n       Starting with Solaris 8, perl5.00503 (or higher) is supplied with the\n       operating system, so you might not even need to build a newer version\n       of perl at all.\tThe Sun-supplied version is installed in /usr/perl5\n       with /usr/bin/perl pointing to /usr/perl5/bin/perl.  Do not disturb\n       that installation unless you really know what you are doing.  If you\n       remove the perl supplied with the OS, you will render some bits of your\n       system inoperable.  If you wish to install a newer version of perl,\n       install it under a different prefix from /usr/perl5.  Common prefixes\n       to use are /usr/local and /opt/perl."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlsolaris`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nYou may wish to put your version of perl in the PATH of all users by\n       changing the link /usr/bin/perl.  This is probably OK, as most perl\n       scripts shipped with Solaris use an explicit path.  (There are a few\n       exceptions, such as /usr/bin/rpm2cpio and /etc/rcm/scripts/README, but\n       these are also sufficiently generic that the actual version of perl\n       probably doesn't matter too much.)\n\n       Solaris ships with a range of Solaris-specific modules.\tIf you choose\n       to install your own version of perl you will find the source of many of\n       these modules is available on CPAN under the Sun::Solaris:: namespace.\n\n       Solaris may include two versions of perl, e.g. Solaris 9 includes both\n       5.005_03 and 5.6.1.  This is to provide stability across Solaris\n       releases, in cases where a later perl version has incompatibilities\n       with the version included in the preceding Solaris release.  The\n       default perl version will always be the most recent, and in general the\n       old version will only be retained for one Solaris release.  Note also\n       that the default perl will NOT be configured to search for modules in\n       the older version, again due to compatibility/stability concerns.  As a\n       consequence if you upgrade Solaris, you will have to rebuild/reinstall\n       any additional CPAN modules that you installed for the previous Solaris\n       version.  See the CPAN manpage under 'autobundle' for a quick way of\n       doing this."

    Avoid libucb.

           Solaris provides some BSD-compatibility functions in
           /usr/ucblib/libucb.a.  Perl will not build and run correctly if linked
           against -lucb since it contains routines that are incompatible with the
           standard Solaris libc.  Normally this is not a problem since the
           solaris hints file prevents Configure from even looking in /usr/ucblib
           for libraries, and also explicitly omits -lucb.

       Environment for Compiling perl on Solaris
           PATH

           Make sure your PATH includes the compiler (/opt/SUNWspro/bin/ if you're
           using Sun's compiler) as well as /usr/ccs/bin/ to pick up the other
           development tools (such as make, ar, as, and ld).  Make sure your path
           either doesn't include /usr/ucb or that it includes it after the
           compiler and compiler tools and other standard Solaris directories.
           You definitely don't want /usr/ucb/cc.

           LD_LIBRARY_PATH

           If you have the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable set, be sure that
           it does NOT include /lib or /usr/lib.  If you will be building
           extensions that call third-party shared libraries (e.g. Berkeley DB)

    RUNTIME ISSUES FOR PERL ON SOLARIS.
       Limits on Numbers of Open Files on Solaris.
           The stdio(3C) manpage notes that for LP32 applications, only 255 files
           may be opened using fopen(), and only file descriptors 0 through 255
           can be used in a stream.  Since perl calls open() and then fdopen(3C)
           with the resulting file descriptor, perl is limited to 255 simultaneous
           open files, even if sysopen() is used.  If this proves to be an
           insurmountable problem, you can compile perl as a LP64 application, see
           "Building an LP64 perl" for details.  Note also that the default
           resource limit for open file descriptors on Solaris is 255, so you will
           have to modify your ulimit or rctl (Solaris 9 onwards) appropriately.

    SOLARIS-SPECIFIC MODULES.
           See the modules under the Solaris:: and Sun::Solaris namespaces on
           CPAN, see <http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Solaris/> and
           <http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Sun/>.

    SOLARIS-SPECIFIC PROBLEMS WITH MODULES.
       Proc::ProcessTable on Solaris
           Proc::ProcessTable does not compile on Solaris with perl5.6.0 and
           higher if you have LARGEFILES defined.  Since largefile support is the
           default in 5.6.0 and later, you have to take special steps to use this
           module.

- prompt: |-
    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlsolaris`.



    Manpage text:

    The problem is that various structures visible via procfs use off_t,
           and if you compile with largefile support these change from 32 bits to
           64 bits.  Thus what you get back from procfs doesn't match up with the
           structures in perl, resulting in garbage.  See proc(4) for further
           discussion.

           A fix for Proc::ProcessTable is to edit Makefile to explicitly remove
           the largefile flags from the ones MakeMaker picks up from Config.pm.
           This will result in Proc::ProcessTable being built under the correct
           environment.  Everything should then be OK as long as
           Proc::ProcessTable doesn't try to share off_t's with the rest of perl,
           or if it does they should be explicitly specified as off64_t.

       BSD::Resource on Solaris
           BSD::Resource versions earlier than 1.09 do not compile on Solaris with
           perl 5.6.0 and higher, for the same reasons as Proc::ProcessTable.
           BSD::Resource versions starting from 1.09 have a workaround for the
           problem.
