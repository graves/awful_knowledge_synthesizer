Why must I do this?\n       (contributed by brian d foy)\n\n       You might like to read Mark Jason Dominus's \"Suffering From Buffering\"\n       at <http://perl.plover.com/FAQs/Buffering.html> .\n\n       Perl normally buffers output so it doesn't make a system call for every\n       bit of output. By saving up output, it makes fewer expensive system\n       calls.  For instance, in this little bit of code, you want to print a\n       dot to the screen for every line you process to watch the progress of\n       your program.  Instead of seeing a dot for every line, Perl buffers the\n       output and you have a long wait before you see a row of 50 dots all at\n       once:\n\n\t   # long wait, then row of dots all at once\n\t   while( <> ) {\n\t       print \".\";\n\t       print \"\\n\" unless ++$count % 50;"

    If you know you are only going to use a system that does correctly
           implement appending (i.e. not Win32) then you can omit the "seek" from
           the code in the previous answer.

           If you know you are only writing code to run on an OS and filesystem
           that does implement append mode correctly (a local filesystem on a
           modern Unix for example), and you keep the file in block-buffered mode
           and you write less than one buffer-full of output between each manual
           flushing of the buffer then each bufferload is almost guaranteed to be
           written to the end of the file in one chunk without getting
           intermingled with anyone else's output. You can also use the "syswrite"
           function which is simply a wrapper around your system's write(2) system
           call.

           There is still a small theoretical chance that a signal will interrupt
           the system-level "write()" operation before completion. There is also a
           possibility that some STDIO implementations may call multiple system
           level "write()"s even if the buffer was empty to start. There may be
           some systems where this probability is reduced to zero, and this is not
           a concern when using ":perlio" instead of your system's STDIO.
