AES is a 128-bit block cipher with a variable key size\n       of 128, 192 or 256 bits. This implementation supports ECB and CBC\n       modes.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::aes::aes ?-mode [ecb|cbc]? ?-dir [encrypt|decrypt]? -key keydata ?-iv\n       vector? ?-hex? ?-out channel? ?-chunksize size? [ -in channel | data ]\n\t      Perform the aes algorithm on either the data provided by the\n\t      argument or on the data read from the -in channel. If an -out\n\t      channel is given then the result will be written to this\n\t      channel.\n\n\t      The -key option must be given. This parameter takes a binary\n\t      string of either 16, 24 or 32 bytes in length and is used to\n\t      generate the key schedule.\n\n\t      The -mode and -dir options are optional and default to cbc mode\n\t      and encrypt respectively. The initialization vector -iv takes a\n\t      16 byte binary argument which defaults to all zeros.  See MODES\n\t      OF OPERATION for more about available modes and their uses.\n\n\t      AES is a 128-bit block cipher. This means that the data must be\n\t      provided in units that are a multiple of 16 bytes.\n\nPROGRAMMING INTERFACE\n       Internal state is maintained in an opaque structure that is returned\n       from the Init function. In ECB mode the state is not affected by the\n       input but for CBC mode some input dependent state is maintained and may\n       be reset by calling the Reset function with a new initialization vector\n       value.\n\n       ::aes::Init mode keydata iv\n\t      Construct a new AES key schedule using the specified key data\n\t      and the given initialization vector. The initialization vector\n\t      is not used with ECB mode but is important for CBC mode.\tSee\n\t      MODES OF OPERATION for details about cipher modes.\n\n       ::aes::Encrypt Key data\n\t      Use a prepared key acquired by calling Init to encrypt the\n\t      provided data. The data argument should be a binary array that\n\t      is a multiple of the AES block size of 16 bytes. The result is a\n\t      binary array the same size as the input of encrypted data.\n\n       ::aes::Decrypt Key data\n\t      Decipher data using the key. Note that the same key may be used\n\t      to encrypt and decrypt data provided that the initialization\n\t      vector is reset appropriately for CBC mode.\n\n       ::aes::Reset Key iv\n\t      Reset the initialization vector. This permits the programmer to\n\t      re-use a key and avoid the cost of re-generating the key\n\t      schedule where the same key data is being used multiple times.\n\n       ::aes::Final Key\n\t      This should be called to clean up resources associated with Key.\n\t      Once this function has been called the key may not be used\n\t      again.\n\nMODES OF OPERATION\n       Electronic Code Book (ECB)\n\t      ECB is the basic mode of all block ciphers. Each block is\n\t      encrypted independently and so identical plain text will produce\n\t      identical output when encrypted with the same key. Any\n\t      encryption errors will only affect a single block however this\n\t      is vulnerable to known plaintext attacks.\n\n       Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)\n\t      CBC mode uses the output of the last block encryption to affect\n\t      the current block. An initialization vector of the same size as\n\t      the cipher block size is used to handle the first block. The\n\t      initialization vector should be chosen randomly and transmitted\n\t      as the first block of the output. Errors in encryption affect\n\t      the current block and the next block after which the cipher will\n\t      correct itself. CBC is the most commonly used mode in software\n\t      encryption. This is the default mode of operation for this\n\t      module.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n       % set nil_block [string repeat \\\\0 16]\n       % aes::aes -hex -mode cbc -dir encrypt -key $nil_block $nil_block\n       66e94bd4ef8a2c3b884cfa59ca342b2e"
