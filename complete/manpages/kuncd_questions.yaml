The\n     daemon also handles kernel reqeusts to execute user-space helper tools.\n\n     The daemon is launched by launchd(8) when a request has been received\n     from the kernel and will exit 15 seconds after the last request has been\n     processed.\n\n     The daemon cannot be used directly by the user.\n\nSIGNALS\n     SIGTERM  This signal will result in the daemon unregistering itself from\n\t      launchd and exiting.  Once it is unregistered, it will not run\n\t      again until it is reregistered.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     launchd(8)\n\nHISTORY\n     The kuncd daemon was introduced in Mac OS X 10.3.\n\nNOTES\n     This daemon and its current behavior may change without notice.  Do not\n     rely on its existence or its behavior.  Consider it an unsupported\n     command."
