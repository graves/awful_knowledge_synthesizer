Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlhurd`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPERLHURD(1)\t       Perl Programmers Reference Guide \t   PERLHURD(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       perlhurd - Perl version 5 on Hurd\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       If you want to use Perl on the Hurd, I recommend using the Debian\n       GNU/Hurd distribution ( see <https://www.debian.org/> ), even if an\n       official, stable release has not yet been made.\tThe old \"gnu-0.2\"\n       binary distribution will most certainly have additional problems.\n\n   Known Problems with Perl on Hurd\n       The Perl test suite may still report some errors on the Hurd.  The\n       \"lib/anydbm\" and \"pragma/warnings\" tests will almost certainly fail.\n       Both failures are not really specific to the Hurd, as indicated by the\n       test suite output.\n\n       The socket tests may fail if the network is not configured.  You have\n       to make \"/hurd/pfinet\" the translator for \"/servers/socket/2\", giving\n       it the right arguments.\tTry \"/hurd/pfinet --help\" for more\n       information.\n\n       Here are the statistics for Perl 5.005_62 on my system:\n\n\tFailed Test  Status Wstat Total Fail  Failed  List of failed\n\t-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\tlib/anydbm.t\t\t     12    1   8.33%  12\n\tpragma/warnings \t    333    1   0.30%  215\n\n\t8 tests and 24 subtests skipped.\n\tFailed 2/229 test scripts, 99.13% okay. 2/10850 subtests failed,\n\t    99.98% okay.\n\n       There are quite a few systems out there that do worse!\n\n       However, since I am running a very recent Hurd snapshot, in which a lot\n       of bugs that were exposed by the Perl test suite have been fixed, you\n       may encounter more failures.  Likely candidates are: \"op/stat\",\n       \"lib/io_pipe\", \"lib/io_sock\", \"lib/io_udp\" and \"lib/time\".\n\n       In any way, if you're seeing failures beyond those mentioned in this\n       document, please consider upgrading to the latest Hurd before reporting\n       the failure as a bug.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Mark Kettenis <kettenis@gnu.org>\n\n       Last Updated: Fri, 29 Oct 1999 22:50:30 +0200\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t\t   PERLHURD(1)"
