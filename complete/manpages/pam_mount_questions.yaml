In terms of the function-class\n     parameter, these are “auth” and “session” respectively.\n\n   The Home Folder Mounting Authentication Module\n     The Home Folder Mounting authentication module reads the mount\n     authenticator from the PAM authentication context and caches it in the\n     PAM environment.  The Home Folder Mounting Session Management Module must\n     be used in conjunction with this module to remove the authenticator from\n     the PAM environment.\n\n   The Home Folder Mounting Session Management Module\n     The Home Folder Mounting session management module copies the mount\n     authenticator from the PAM environment, removes it from the PAM\n     environment, and uses its copy to mount the user's home folder if the\n     user's OpenDirectory record indicates that an AFP, SMB, NFS or FileVault\n     home folder is to be used."
