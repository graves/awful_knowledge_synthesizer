It is used within mdoc(7) and man(7)\n     pages.  This manual describes the subset of the tbl language accepted by\n     the mandoc(1) utility.\n\n     Each table is started with a roff(7) TS macro, consist of at most one\n     line of Options, one or more Layout lines, one or more Data lines, and\n     ends with a TE macro.  All input must be 7-bit ASCII.\n\n   Options\n     If the first input line of a table ends with a semicolon, it contains\n     case-insensitive options separated by spaces, tabs, or commas.\n     Otherwise, it is interpreted as the first Layout line.\n\n     The following options are available.  Some of them require arguments\n     enclosed in parentheses:\n\n     allbox  Draw a single-line box around each table cell.\n\n     box     Draw a single-line box around the table.  For GNU compatibility,\n\t     this may also be invoked with frame."

    Data
         The data section follows the last Layout line.  Each data line consists
         of one or more data cells, delimited by tab characters.

         If a data cell contains only the two bytes ‘\^’, the cell above spans to
         this row, as if the layout specification of this cell were ^.

         If a data cell contains only the single character ‘_’ or ‘=’, a single or
         double horizontal line is drawn across the cell, joining its neighbours.
         If a data cell contains only the two character sequence ‘\_’ or ‘\=’, a
         single or double horizontal line is drawn inside the cell, not joining
         its neighbours.  If a data line contains nothing but the single character
         ‘_’ or ‘=’, a horizontal line across the whole table is inserted without
         consuming a layout row.

         In place of any data cell, a text block can be used.  It starts with T{
         at the end of a physical input line.  Input line breaks inside the text
         block neither end the text block nor its data cell.  It only ends if T}
         occurs at the beginning of a physical input line and is followed by an
         end-of-cell indicator.  If the T} is followed by the end of the physical
         input line, the text block, the data cell, and the data line ends at this
         point.  If the T} is followed by the tab character, only the text block
         and the data cell end, but the data line continues with the data cell
         following the tab character.  If T} is followed by any other character,
         it does not end the text block, which instead continues to the following
         physical input line.

    Manpage text:

    These examples were constructed to demonstrate many tbl features in a
         compact way.  In real manual pages, keep tables as simple as possible.
         They usually look better, are less fragile, and are more portable.

    COMPATIBILITY
         The mandoc(1) implementation of tbl doesn't support mdoc(7) and man(7)
         macros and eqn(7) equations inside tables.

         M. E. Lesk, Tbl — A Program to Format Tables, June 11, 1976.

    HISTORY
         The tbl utility, a preprocessor for troff, was originally written by M.
         E. Lesk at Bell Labs in 1975.  The GNU reimplementation of tbl, part of
         the groff package, was released in 1990 by James Clark.  A standalone tbl
         implementation was written by Kristaps Dzonsons in 2010.  This formed the
         basis of the implementation that first appeared in OpenBSD 4.9 as a part
         of the mandoc(1) utility.

    AUTHORS
         This tbl reference was written by Kristaps Dzonsons <kristaps@bsd.lv> and
         Ingo Schwarze <schwarze@openbsd.org>.
