This implementation\n     can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, rpm, 7-zip, and ISO\n     9660 cdrom images and can create tar, pax, cpio, ar, zip, 7-zip, and shar\n     archives.\n\n     The first synopsis form shows a “bundled” option word.  This usage is\n     provided for compatibility with historical implementations.  See\n     COMPATIBILITY below for details.\n\n     The other synopsis forms show the preferred usage.  The first option to\n     tar is a mode indicator from the following list:\n     -c      Create a new archive containing the specified items.  The long\n\t     option form is --create.\n     -r      Like -c, but new entries are appended to the archive.  Note that\n\t     this only works on uncompressed archives stored in regular files.\n\t     The -f option is required.  The long option form is --append.\n     -t      List archive contents to stdout.  The long option form is --list.\n     -u      Like -r, but new entries are added only if they have a\n\t     modification date newer than the corresponding entry in the\n\t     archive.  Note that this only works on uncompressed archives\n\t     stored in regular files.  The -f option is required.  The long\n\t     form is --update.\n     -x      Extract to disk from the archive.\tIf a file with the same name\n\t     appears more than once in the archive, each copy will be\n\t     extracted, with later copies overwriting (replacing) earlier\n\t     copies.  The long option form is --extract."

As a\n\t     simple example,\n\t\t   tar -c -f - newfile @original.tar\n\t     writes a new archive to standard output containing a file newfile\n\t     and all of the entries from original.tar.\tIn contrast,\n\t\t   tar -c -f - newfile original.tar\n\t     creates a new archive with only two entries.  Similarly,\n\t\t   tar -czf - --format pax @-\n\t     reads an archive from standard input (whose format will be\n\t     determined automatically) and converts it into a gzip-compressed\n\t     pax-format archive on stdout.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tar`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nSECURITY\n     Certain security issues are common to many archiving programs, including\n     tar.  In particular, carefully-crafted archives can request that tar\n     extract files to locations outside of the target directory.  This can\n     potentially be used to cause unwitting users to overwrite files they did\n     not intend to overwrite.  If the archive is being extracted by the\n     superuser, any file on the system can potentially be overwritten.\tThere\n     are three ways this can happen.  Although tar has mechanisms to protect\n     against each one, savvy users should be aware of the implications:\n\n     •\t     Archive entries can have absolute pathnames.  By default, tar\n\t     removes the leading / character from filenames before restoring\n\t     them to guard against this problem.\n\n     •\t     Archive entries can have pathnames that include .. components.\n\t     By default, tar will not extract files containing .. components\n\t     in their pathname.\n\n     •\t     Archive entries can exploit symbolic links to restore files to\n\t     other directories.  An archive can restore a symbolic link to\n\t     another directory, then use that link to restore a file into that\n\t     directory.  To guard against this, tar checks each extracted path\n\t     for symlinks.  If the final path element is a symlink, it will be\n\t     removed and replaced with the archive entry.  If -U is specified,\n\t     any intermediate symlink will also be unconditionally removed.\n\t     If neither -U nor -P is specified, tar will refuse to extract the\n\t     entry.\n     To protect yourself, you should be wary of any archives that come from\n     untrusted sources.  You should examine the contents of an archive with\n\t   tar -tf filename\n     before extraction.  You should use the -k option to ensure that tar will\n     not overwrite any existing files or the -U option to remove any pre-\n     existing files.  You should generally not extract archives while running\n     with super-user privileges.  Note that the -P option to tar disables the\n     security checks above and allows you to extract an archive while\n     preserving any absolute pathnames, .. components, or symlinks to other\n     directories."

    STANDARDS
         There is no current POSIX standard for the tar command; it appeared in
         ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (“POSIX.1”) but was dropped from IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
         (“POSIX.1”).  The options supported by this implementation were developed
         by surveying a number of existing tar implementations as well as the old
         POSIX specification for tar and the current POSIX specification for pax.

         The ustar and pax interchange file formats are defined by IEEE Std
         1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”) for the pax command.

    HISTORY
         A tar command appeared in Seventh Edition Unix, which was released in
         January, 1979.  There have been numerous other implementations, many of
         which extended the file format.  John Gilmore's pdtar public-domain
         implementation (circa November, 1987) was quite influential, and formed
         the basis of GNU tar.  GNU tar was included as the standard system tar in
         FreeBSD beginning with FreeBSD 1.0.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tar`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThis is a complete re-implementation based on the libarchive(3) library.\n     It was first released with FreeBSD 5.4 in May, 2005.\n\nBUGS\n     This program follows ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (“POSIX.1”) for the definition\n     of the -l option.\tNote that GNU tar prior to version 1.15 treated -l as\n     a synonym for the --one-file-system option.\n\n     The -C dir option may differ from historic implementations.\n\n     All archive output is written in correctly-sized blocks, even if the\n     output is being compressed.  Whether or not the last output block is\n     padded to a full block size varies depending on the format and the output\n     device.  For tar and cpio formats, the last block of output is padded to\n     a full block size if the output is being written to standard output or to\n     a character or block device such as a tape drive.\tIf the output is being\n     written to a regular file, the last block will not be padded.  Many\n     compressors, including gzip(1) and bzip2(1), complain about the null\n     padding when decompressing an archive created by tar, although they still\n     extract it correctly."

  manpageQuestion3: What is the difference between the -l and --one-file-system options in tar?

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tar`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe compression and decompression is implemented internally, so there may\n     be insignificant differences between the compressed output generated by\n\t   tar -czf - file\n     and that generated by\n\t   tar -cf - file | gzip\n\n     The default should be to read and write archives to the standard I/O\n     paths, but tradition (and POSIX) dictates otherwise.\n\n     The r and u modes require that the archive be uncompressed and located in\n     a regular file on disk.  Other archives can be modified using c mode with\n     the @archive-file extension.\n\n     To archive a file called @foo or -foo you must specify it as ./@foo or\n     ./-foo, respectively.\n\n     In create mode, a leading ./ is always removed.  A leading / is stripped\n     unless the -P option is specified.\n\n     There needs to be better support for file selection on both create and\n     extract.\n\n     There is not yet any support for multi-volume archives.\n\n     Converting between dissimilar archive formats (such as tar and cpio)\n     using the @- convention can cause hard link information to be lost.\n     (This is a consequence of the incompatible ways that different archive\n     formats store hardlink information.)"
