At its simplest, the AGENT specification will\n       consist of a hostname or an IPv4 address.  n this situation, the\n       command will attempt communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to\n       port 161 of the given target host.\n\n       See the snmpcmd(1) manual page for a full list of the possible formats\n       for AGENT.\n\n       The information returned is:\n\n\t      The IP address of the entity.\n\t      A textual description of the entity (sysDescr.0)\n\t      The uptime of the entity's SNMP agent (sysUpTime.0)\n\t      The sum of received packets on all interfaces (ifInUCastPkts.* +\n\t      ifInNUCastPkts.*)\n\t      The sum of transmitted packets on all interfaces\n\t      (ifOutUCastPkts.* + ifOutNUCastPkts.*)\n\t      The number of IP input packets (ipInReceives.0)\n\t      The number of IP output packets (ipOutRequests.0)"
