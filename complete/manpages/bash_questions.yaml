Bash also\n       incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).\n\n       Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and\n       Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard\n       1003.1).  Bash can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.\n\nOPTIONS\n       In addition to the single-character shell options documented in the\n       description of the set builtin command, bash interprets the following\n       options when it is invoked:\n\n       -c string If the -c option is present, then commands are read from\n\t\t string.  If there are arguments after the string, they are\n\t\t assigned to the positional parameters, starting with $0.\n       -i\t If the -i option is present, the shell is interactive.\n       -l\t Make bash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see\n\t\t INVOCATION below).\n       -r\t If the -r option is present, the shell becomes restricted\n\t\t (see RESTRICTED SHELL below).\n       -s\t If the -s option is present, or if no arguments remain after\n\t\t option processing, then commands are read from the standard\n\t\t input.  This option allows the positional parameters to be\n\t\t set when invoking an interactive shell.\n       -D\t A list of all double-quoted strings preceded by $ is printed\n\t\t on the standard output.  These are the strings that are\n\t\t subject to language translation when the current locale is\n\t\t not C or POSIX.  This implies the -n option; no commands will\n\t\t be executed.\n       [-+]O [shopt_option]\n\t\t shopt_option is one of the shell options accepted by the\n\t\t shopt builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  If\n\t\t shopt_option is present, -O sets the value of that option; +O\n\t\t unsets it.  If shopt_option is not supplied, the names and\n\t\t values of the shell options accepted by shopt are printed on\n\t\t the standard output.  If the invocation option is +O, the\n\t\t output is displayed in a format that may be reused as input.\n       --\t A -- signals the end of options and disables further option\n\t\t processing.  Any arguments after the -- are treated as\n\t\t filenames and arguments.  An argument of - is equivalent to\n\t\t --."

    The following paragraphs describe how bash executes its startup files.
           If any of the files exist but cannot be read, bash reports an error.
           Tildes are expanded in file names as described below under Tilde
           Expansion in the EXPANSION section.

           When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-
           interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes
           commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.  After
           reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and
           ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the
           first one that exists and is readable.  The --noprofile option may be
           used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

           When a login shell exits, bash reads and executes commands from the
           file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.

           When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash
           reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists.  This
           may be inhibited by using the --norc option.  The --rcfile file option
           will force bash to read and execute commands from file instead of
           ~/.bashrc.

Bash behaves as if the following\n       command were executed:\n\t      if [ -n \"$BASH_ENV\" ]; then . \"$BASH_ENV\"; fi\n       but the value of the PATH variable is not used to search for the file\n       name.\n\n       If bash is invoked with the name sh, it tries to mimic the startup\n       behavior of historical versions of sh as closely as possible, while\n       conforming to the POSIX standard as well.

    Manpage text:

    When bash is started in posix mode, as with the --posix command line
           option, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files.  In this mode,
           interactive shells expand the ENV variable and commands are read and
           executed from the file whose name is the expanded value.  No other
           startup files are read.

           Bash attempts to determine when it is being run by the remote shell
           daemon, usually rshd.  If bash determines it is being run by rshd, it
           reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists and is
           readable.  It will not do this if invoked as sh.  The --norc option may
           be used to inhibit this behavior, and the --rcfile option may be used
           to force another file to be read, but rshd does not generally invoke
           the shell with those options or allow them to be specified.

           If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to
           the real user (group) id, and the -p option is not supplied, no startup
           files are read, shell functions are not inherited from the environment,
           the SHELLOPTS variable, if it appears in the environment, is ignored,
           and the effective user id is set to the real user id.  If the -p option
           is supplied at invocation, the startup behavior is the same, but the
           effective user id is not reset.

    Manpage text:

    The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command,
           unless the pipefail option is enabled.  If pipefail is enabled, the
           pipeline's return status is the value of the last (rightmost) command
           to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit
           successfully.  If the reserved word !  precedes a pipeline, the exit
           status of that pipeline is the logical negation of the exit status as
           described above.  The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to
           terminate before returning a value.

           If the time reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed as well as
           user and system time consumed by its execution are reported when the

           <newline>.

           Of these list operators, && and ⎪⎪ have equal precedence, followed by ;

    COMMENTS
           In a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the
           interactive_comments option to the shopt builtin is enabled (see SHELL
           BUILTIN COMMANDS below), a word beginning with # causes that word and
           all remaining characters on that line to be ignored.  An interactive
           shell without the interactive_comments option enabled does not allow
           comments.  The interactive_comments option is on by default in
           interactive shells.

    QUOTING
           Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or
           words to the shell.  Quoting can be used to disable special treatment
           for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being recognized
           as such, and to prevent parameter expansion.

           Each of the metacharacters listed above under DEFINITIONS has special
           meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself.

           When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see
           HISTORY EXPANSION below), the history expansion character, usually !,
           must be quoted to prevent history expansion.

    Manpage text:

    There are three quoting mechanisms: the escape character, single
           quotes, and double quotes.

           A non-quoted backslash (\) is the escape character.  It preserves the
           literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of
           <newline>.  If a \<newline> pair appears, and the backslash is not
           itself quoted, the \<newline> is treated as a line continuation (that
           is, it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).

           Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of
           each character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur between
           single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.

           Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of
           all characters within the quotes, with the exception of $, `, \, and,
           when history expansion is enabled, !.  The characters $ and ` retain
           their special meaning within double quotes.  The backslash retains its
           special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters:
           $, `, ", \, or <newline>.  A double quote may be quoted within double
           quotes by preceding it with a backslash.  If enabled, history expansion
           will be performed unless an !  appearing in double quotes is escaped
           using a backslash.  The backslash preceding the !  is not removed.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `bash`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe following variables are used by the shell.  In some cases, bash\n       assigns a default value to a variable; these cases are noted below.\n\n       BASH_ENV\n\t      If this parameter is set when bash is executing a shell script,\n\t      its value is interpreted as a filename containing commands to\n\t      initialize the shell, as in ~/.bashrc.  The value of BASH_ENV is\n\t      subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and\n\t      arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a file name.\n\t      PATH is not used to search for the resultant file name.\n       CDPATH The search path for the cd command.  This is a colon-separated\n\t      list of directories in which the shell looks for destination\n\t      directories specified by the cd command.\tA sample value is\n\t      \".:~:/usr\".\n       COLUMNS\n\t      Used by the select builtin command to determine the terminal\n\t      width when printing selection lists.  Automatically set upon\n\t      receipt of a SIGWINCH.\n       COMPREPLY\n\t      An array variable from which bash reads the possible completions\n\t      generated by a shell function invoked by the programmable\n\t      completion facility (see Programmable Completion below).\n       EMACS  If bash finds this variable in the environment when the shell\n\t      starts with value \"t\", it assumes that the shell is running in\n\t      an emacs shell buffer and disables line editing.\n       FCEDIT The default editor for the fc builtin command.\n       FIGNORE\n\t      A colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when performing\n\t      filename completion (see READLINE below).  A filename whose\n\t      suffix matches one of the entries in FIGNORE is excluded from\n\t      the list of matched filenames.  A sample value is \".o:~\".\n       GLOBIGNORE\n\t      A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of filenames\n\t      to be ignored by pathname expansion.  If a filename matched by a\n\t      pathname expansion pattern also matches one of the patterns in\n\t      GLOBIGNORE, it is removed from the list of matches.\n       HISTCONTROL\n\t      A colon-separated list of values controlling how commands are\n\t      saved on the history list.  If the list of values includes\n\t      ignorespace, lines which begin with a space character are not\n\t      saved in the history list.  A value of ignoredups causes lines\n\t      matching the previous history entry to not be saved.  A value of\n\t      ignoreboth is shorthand for ignorespace and ignoredups.  A value\n\t      of erasedups causes all previous lines matching the current line\n\t      to be removed from the history list before that line is saved.\n\t      Any value not in the above list is ignored.  If HISTCONTROL is\n\t      unset, or does not include a valid value, all lines read by the\n\t      shell parser are saved on the history list, subject to the value\n\t      of HISTIGNORE.  The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line\n\t      compound command are not tested, and are added to the history\n\t      regardless of the value of HISTCONTROL.\n       HISTFILE\n\t      The name of the file in which command history is saved (see\n\t      HISTORY below).  The default value is ~/.bash_history.  If\n\t      unset, the command history is not saved when an interactive\n\t      shell exits.\n       HISTFILESIZE\n\t      The maximum number of lines contained in the history file.  When\n\t      this variable is assigned a value, the history file is\n\t      truncated, if necessary, by removing the oldest entries, to\n\t      contain no more than that number of lines.  The default value is\n\t      500.  The history file is also truncated to this size after\n\t      writing it when an interactive shell exits.\n       HISTIGNORE\n\t      A colon-separated list of patterns used to decide which command\n\t      lines should be saved on the history list.  Each pattern is\n\t      anchored at the beginning of the line and must match the\n\t      complete line (no implicit `*' is appended).  Each pattern is\n\t      tested against the line after the checks specified by\n\t      HISTCONTROL are applied.\tIn addition to the normal shell\n\t      pattern matching characters, `&' matches the previous history\n\t      line.  `&' may be escaped using a backslash; the backslash is\n\t      removed before attempting a match.  The second and subsequent\n\t      lines of a multi-line compound command are not tested, and are\n\t      added to the history regardless of the value of HISTIGNORE.\n       HISTSIZE\n\t      The number of commands to remember in the command history (see\n\t      HISTORY below).  The default value is 500.\n       HISTTIMEFORMAT\n\t      If this variable is set and not null, its value is used as a\n\t      format string for strftime(3) to print the time stamp associated\n\t      with each history entry displayed by the history builtin.  If\n\t      this variable is set, time stamps are written to the history\n\t      file so they may be preserved across shell sessions.\n       HOME   The home directory of the current user; the default argument for\n\t      the cd builtin command.  The value of this variable is also used\n\t      when performing tilde expansion.\n       HOSTFILE\n\t      Contains the name of a file in the same format as /etc/hosts\n\t      that should be read when the shell needs to complete a hostname.\n\t      The list of possible hostname completions may be changed while\n\t      the shell is running; the next time hostname completion is\n\t      attempted after the value is changed, bash adds the contents of\n\t      the new file to the existing list.  If HOSTFILE is set, but has\n\t      no value, bash attempts to read /etc/hosts to obtain the list of\n\t      possible hostname completions.  When HOSTFILE is unset, the\n\t      hostname list is cleared.\n       IFS    The Internal Field Separator that is used for word splitting\n\t      after expansion and to split lines into words with the read\n\t      builtin command.\tThe default value is\n\t      ``<space><tab><newline>''.\n       IGNOREEOF\n\t      Controls the action of an interactive shell on receipt of an EOF\n\t      character as the sole input.  If set, the value is the number of\n\t      consecutive EOF characters which must be typed as the first\n\t      characters on an input line before bash exits.  If the variable\n\t      exists but does not have a numeric value, or has no value, the\n\t      default value is 10.  If it does not exist, EOF signifies the\n\t      end of input to the shell.\n       INPUTRC\n\t      The filename for the readline startup file, overriding the\n\t      default of ~/.inputrc (see READLINE below).\n       LANG   Used to determine the locale category for any category not\n\t      specifically selected with a variable starting with LC_.\n       LC_ALL This variable overrides the value of LANG and any other LC_\n\t      variable specifying a locale category.\n       LC_COLLATE\n\t      This variable determines the collation order used when sorting\n\t      the results of pathname expansion, and determines the behavior\n\t      of range expressions, equivalence classes, and collating\n\t      sequences within pathname expansion and pattern matching.\n       LC_CTYPE\n\t      This variable determines the interpretation of characters and\n\t      the behavior of character classes within pathname expansion and\n\t      pattern matching.\n       LC_MESSAGES\n\t      This variable determines the locale used to translate double-\n\t      quoted strings preceded by a $.\n       LC_NUMERIC\n\t      This variable determines the locale category used for number\n\t      formatting.\n       LINES  Used by the select builtin command to determine the column\n\t      length for printing selection lists.  Automatically set upon\n\t      receipt of a SIGWINCH.\n       MAIL   If this parameter is set to a file name and the MAILPATH\n\t      variable is not set, bash informs the user of the arrival of\n\t      mail in the specified file.\n       MAILCHECK\n\t      Specifies how often (in seconds) bash checks for mail.  The\n\t      default is 60 seconds.  When it is time to check for mail, the\n\t      shell does so before displaying the primary prompt.  If this\n\t      variable is unset, or set to a value that is not a number\n\t      greater than or equal to zero, the shell disables mail checking.\n       MAILPATH\n\t      A colon-separated list of file names to be checked for mail.\n\t      The message to be printed when mail arrives in a particular file\n\t      may be specified by separating the file name from the message\n\t      with a `?'.  When used in the text of the message, $_ expands to\n\t      the name of the current mailfile.  Example:\n\t      MAILPATH='/var/mail/bfox?\"You have mail\":~/shell-mail?\"$_ has\n\t      mail!\"'\n\t      Bash supplies a default value for this variable, but the\n\t      location of the user mail files that it uses is system dependent\n\t      (e.g., /var/mail/$USER).\n       OPTERR If set to the value 1, bash displays error messages generated by\n\t      the getopts builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).\n\t      OPTERR is initialized to 1 each time the shell is invoked or a\n\t      shell script is executed.\n       PATH   The search path for commands.  It is a colon-separated list of\n\t      directories in which the shell looks for commands (see COMMAND\n\t      EXECUTION below).  A zero-length (null) directory name in the\n\t      value of PATH indicates the current directory.  A null directory\n\t      name may appear as two adjacent colons, or as an initial or\n\t      trailing colon.  The default path is system-dependent, and is\n\t      set by the administrator who installs bash.  A common value is\n\t      ``/usr/gnu/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin''.\n       POSIXLY_CORRECT\n\t      If this variable is in the environment when bash starts, the\n\t      shell enters posix mode before reading the startup files, as if\n\t      the --posix invocation option had been supplied.\tIf it is set\n\t      while the shell is running, bash enables posix mode, as if the\n\t      command set -o posix had been executed.\n       PROMPT_COMMAND\n\t      If set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each\n\t      primary prompt.\n       PS1    The value of this parameter is expanded (see PROMPTING below)\n\t      and used as the primary prompt string.  The default value is\n\t      ``\\s-\\v\\$ ''.\n       PS2    The value of this parameter is expanded as with PS1 and used as\n\t      the secondary prompt string.  The default is ``> ''.\n       PS3    The value of this parameter is used as the prompt for the select\n\t      command (see SHELL GRAMMAR above).\n       PS4    The value of this parameter is expanded as with PS1 and the\n\t      value is printed before each command bash displays during an\n\t      execution trace.\tThe first character of PS4 is replicated\n\t      multiple times, as necessary, to indicate multiple levels of\n\t      indirection.  The default is ``+ ''.\n       SHELL  The full pathname to the shell is kept in this environment\n\t      variable.  If it is not set when the shell starts, bash assigns\n\t      to it the full pathname of the current user's login shell.\n       TIMEFORMAT\n\t      The value of this parameter is used as a format string\n\t      specifying how the timing information for pipelines prefixed\n\t      with the time reserved word should be displayed.\tThe %\n\t      character introduces an escape sequence that is expanded to a\n\t      time value or other information.\tThe escape sequences and their\n\t      meanings are as follows; the braces denote optional portions.\n\t      %%\tA literal %.\n\t      %[p][l]R\tThe elapsed time in seconds.\n\t      %[p][l]U\tThe number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.\n\t      %[p][l]S\tThe number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.\n\t      %P\tThe CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S) / %R."

If\n\t      set to any other value, the supplied string must be a prefix of\n\t      a stopped job's name; this provides functionality analogous to\n\t      the %string job identifier.\n\n       histchars\n\t      The two or three characters which control history expansion and\n\t      tokenization (see HISTORY EXPANSION below).  The first character\n\t      is the history expansion character, the character which signals\n\t      the start of a history expansion, normally `!'.  The second\n\t      character is the quick substitution character, which is used as\n\t      shorthand for re-running the previous command entered,\n\t      substituting one string for another in the command.  The default\n\t      is `^'.  The optional third character is the character which\n\t      indicates that the remainder of the line is a comment when found\n\t      as the first character of a word, normally `#'.  The history\n\t      comment character causes history substitution to be skipped for\n\t      the remaining words on the line.\tIt does not necessarily cause\n\t      the shell parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.\n\n   Arrays\n       Bash provides one-dimensional array variables.  Any variable may be\n       used as an array; the declare builtin will explicitly declare an array.\n       There is no maximum limit on the size of an array, nor any requirement\n       that members be indexed or assigned contiguously.  Arrays are indexed\n       using integers and are zero-based.\n\n       An array is created automatically if any variable is assigned to using\n       the syntax name[subscript]=value.  The subscript is treated as an\n       arithmetic expression that must evaluate to a number greater than or\n       equal to zero.  To explicitly declare an array, use declare -a name\n       (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  declare -a name[subscript] is also\n       accepted; the subscript is ignored.  Attributes may be specified for an\n       array variable using the declare and readonly builtins.\tEach attribute\n       applies to all members of an array.\n\n       Arrays are assigned to using compound assignments of the form\n       name=(value1 ... valuen), where each value is of the form\n       [subscript]=string.  Only string is required.  If the optional brackets\n       and subscript are supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the\n       index of the element assigned is the last index assigned to by the\n       statement plus one.  Indexing starts at zero.  This syntax is also\n       accepted by the declare builtin.  Individual array elements may be\n       assigned to using the name[subscript]=value syntax introduced above.\n\n       Any element of an array may be referenced using ${name[subscript]}.\n       The braces are required to avoid conflicts with pathname expansion.  If\n       subscript is @ or *, the word expands to all members of name.  These\n       subscripts differ only when the word appears within double quotes.  If\n       the word is double-quoted, ${name[*]} expands to a single word with the\n       value of each array member separated by the first character of the IFS\n       special variable, and ${name[@]} expands each element of name to a\n       separate word.  When there are no array members, ${name[@]} expands to\n       nothing.  If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the\n       expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of\n       the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined\n       with the last part of the original word.  This is analogous to the\n       expansion of the special parameters * and @ (see Special Parameters\n       above).\t${#name[subscript]} expands to the length of\n       ${name[subscript]}.  If subscript is * or @, the expansion is the\n       number of elements in the array.  Referencing an array variable without\n       a subscript is equivalent to referencing element zero.\n\n       The unset builtin is used to destroy arrays.  unset name[subscript]\n       destroys the array element at index subscript.  Care must be taken to\n       avoid unwanted side effects caused by filename generation.  unset name,\n       where name is an array, or unset name[subscript], where subscript is *\n       or @, removes the entire array.\n\n       The declare, local, and readonly builtins each accept a -a option to\n       specify an array.  The read builtin accepts a -a option to assign a\n       list of words read from the standard input to an array.\tThe set and\n       declare builtins display array values in a way that allows them to be\n       reused as assignments.\n\nEXPANSION\n       Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into\n       words.  There are seven kinds of expansion performed: brace expansion,\n       tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command\n       substitution, arithmetic expansion, word splitting, and pathname\n       expansion.\n\n       The order of expansions is: brace expansion, tilde expansion,\n       parameter, variable and arithmetic expansion and command substitution\n       (done in a left-to-right fashion), word splitting, and pathname\n       expansion.\n\n       On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion\n       available: process substitution.\n\n       Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can change\n       the number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand a single\n       word to a single word.  The only exceptions to this are the expansions\n       of \"$@\" and \"${name[@]}\" as explained above (see PARAMETERS).\n\n   Brace Expansion\n       Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be\n       generated.  This mechanism is similar to pathname expansion, but the\n       filenames generated need not exist.  Patterns to be brace expanded take\n       the form of an optional preamble, followed by either a series of comma-\n       separated strings or a sequence expression between a pair of braces,\n       followed by an optional postscript.  The preamble is prefixed to each\n       string contained within the braces, and the postscript is then appended\n       to each resulting string, expanding left to right.\n\n       Brace expansions may be nested.\tThe results of each expanded string\n       are not sorted; left to right order is preserved.  For example,\n       a{d,c,b}e expands into `ade ace abe'.\n\n       A sequence expression takes the form {x..y}, where x and y are either\n       integers or single characters.  When integers are supplied, the\n       expression expands to each number between x and y, inclusive.  When\n       characters are supplied, the expression expands to each character\n       lexicographically between x and y, inclusive.  Note that both x and y\n       must be of the same type.\n\n       Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any\n       characters special to other expansions are preserved in the result.  It\n       is strictly textual.  Bash does not apply any syntactic interpretation\n       to the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.\n\n       A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and\n       closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence\n       expression.  Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged.\n       A { or , may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being considered\n       part of a brace expression.  To avoid conflicts with parameter\n       expansion, the string ${ is not considered eligible for brace\n       expansion.\n\n       This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of\n       the strings to be generated is longer than in the above example:\n\n\t      mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}\n       or\n\t      chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}\n\n       Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with historical\n       versions of sh.\tsh does not treat opening or closing braces specially\n       when they appear as part of a word, and preserves them in the output.\n       Bash removes braces from words as a consequence of brace expansion.\n       For example, a word entered to sh as file{1,2} appears identically in\n       the output.  The same word is output as file1 file2 after expansion by\n       bash.  If strict compatibility with sh is desired, start bash with the\n       +B option or disable brace expansion with the +B option to the set\n       command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).\n\n   Tilde Expansion\n       If a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`~'), all of the\n       characters preceding the first unquoted slash (or all characters, if\n       there is no unquoted slash) are considered a tilde-prefix.  If none of\n       the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the\n       tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible login name.\n       If this login name is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the\n       value of the shell parameter HOME.  If HOME is unset, the home\n       directory of the user executing the shell is substituted instead.\n       Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the home directory\n       associated with the specified login name.\n\n       If the tilde-prefix is a `~+', the value of the shell variable PWD\n       replaces the tilde-prefix.  If the tilde-prefix is a `~-', the value of\n       the shell variable OLDPWD, if it is set, is substituted.  If the\n       characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number\n       N, optionally prefixed by a `+' or a `-', the tilde-prefix is replaced\n       with the corresponding element from the directory stack, as it would be\n       displayed by the dirs builtin invoked with the tilde-prefix as an\n       argument.  If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix\n       consist of a number without a leading `+' or `-', `+' is assumed.\n\n       If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is\n       unchanged.\n\n       Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes\n       immediately following a : or the first =.  In these cases, tilde\n       expansion is also performed.  Consequently, one may use file names with\n       tildes in assignments to PATH, MAILPATH, and CDPATH, and the shell\n       assigns the expanded value.\n\n   Parameter Expansion\n       The `$' character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution,\n       or arithmetic expansion.  The parameter name or symbol to be expanded\n       may be enclosed in braces, which are optional but serve to protect the\n       variable to be expanded from characters immediately following it which\n       could be interpreted as part of the name.\n\n       When braces are used, the matching ending brace is the first `}' not\n       escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not within an\n       embedded arithmetic expansion, command substitution, or parameter\n       expansion.\n\n       ${parameter}\n\t      The value of parameter is substituted.  The braces are required\n\t      when parameter is a positional parameter with more than one\n\t      digit, or when parameter is followed by a character which is not\n\t      to be interpreted as part of its name.\n\n       If the first character of parameter is an exclamation point, a level of\n       variable indirection is introduced.  Bash uses the value of the\n       variable formed from the rest of parameter as the name of the variable;\n       this variable is then expanded and that value is used in the rest of\n       the substitution, rather than the value of parameter itself.  This is\n       known as indirect expansion.  The exceptions to this are the expansions\n       of ${!prefix*} and ${!name[@]} described below.\tThe exclamation point\n       must immediately follow the left brace in order to introduce\n       indirection.\n\n       In each of the cases below, word is subject to tilde expansion,\n       parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.\n       When not performing substring expansion, bash tests for a parameter\n       that is unset or null; omitting the colon results in a test only for a\n       parameter that is unset.\n\n       ${parameter:-word}\n\t      Use Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null, the\n\t      expansion of word is substituted.  Otherwise, the value of\n\t      parameter is substituted.\n       ${parameter:=word}\n\t      Assign Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null, the\n\t      expansion of word is assigned to parameter.  The value of\n\t      parameter is then substituted.  Positional parameters and\n\t      special parameters may not be assigned to in this way.\n       ${parameter:?word}\n\t      Display Error if Null or Unset.  If parameter is null or unset,\n\t      the expansion of word (or a message to that effect if word is\n\t      not present) is written to the standard error and the shell, if\n\t      it is not interactive, exits.  Otherwise, the value of parameter\n\t      is substituted.\n       ${parameter:+word}\n\t      Use Alternate Value.  If parameter is null or unset, nothing is\n\t      substituted, otherwise the expansion of word is substituted.\n       ${parameter:offset}\n       ${parameter:offset:length}\n\t      Substring Expansion. Expands to up to length characters of\n\t      parameter starting at the character specified by offset.\tIf\n\t      length is omitted, expands to the substring of parameter\n\t      starting at the character specified by offset.  length and\n\t      offset are arithmetic expressions (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION\n\t      below).  length must evaluate to a number greater than or equal\n\t      to zero.\tIf offset evaluates to a number less than zero, the\n\t      value is used as an offset from the end of the value of\n\t      parameter.  If parameter is @, the result is length positional\n\t      parameters beginning at offset.  If parameter is an array name\n\t      indexed by @ or *, the result is the length members of the array\n\t      beginning with ${parameter[offset]}.  A negative offset is taken\n\t      relative to one greater than the maximum index of the specified\n\t      array.  Note that a negative offset must be separated from the\n\t      colon by at least one space to avoid being confused with the :-\n\t      expansion.  Substring indexing is zero-based unless the\n\t      positional parameters are used, in which case the indexing\n\t      starts at 1.\n\n       ${!prefix*}\n       ${!prefix@}\n\t      Expands to the names of variables whose names begin with prefix,\n\t      separated by the first character of the IFS special variable.\n\n       ${!name[@]}\n       ${!name[*]}\n\t      If name is an array variable, expands to the list of array\n\t      indices (keys) assigned in name.\tIf name is not an array,\n\t      expands to 0 if name is set and null otherwise.  When @ is used\n\t      and the expansion appears within double quotes, each key expands\n\t      to a separate word.\n\n       ${#parameter}\n\t      The length in characters of the value of parameter is\n\t      substituted.  If parameter is * or @, the value substituted is\n\t      the number of positional parameters.  If parameter is an array\n\t      name subscripted by * or @, the value substituted is the number\n\t      of elements in the array.\n\n       ${parameter#word}\n       ${parameter##word}\n\t      The word is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname\n\t      expansion.  If the pattern matches the beginning of the value of\n\t      parameter, then the result of the expansion is the expanded\n\t      value of parameter with the shortest matching pattern (the ``#''\n\t      case) or the longest matching pattern (the ``##'' case) deleted.\n\t      If parameter is @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied\n\t      to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the\n\t      resultant list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted\n\t      with @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to each\n\t      member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant\n\t      list.\n\n       ${parameter%word}\n       ${parameter%%word}\n\t      The word is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname\n\t      expansion.  If the pattern matches a trailing portion of the\n\t      expanded value of parameter, then the result of the expansion is\n\t      the expanded value of parameter with the shortest matching\n\t      pattern (the ``%'' case) or the longest matching pattern (the\n\t      ``%%'' case) deleted.  If parameter is @ or *, the pattern\n\t      removal operation is applied to each positional parameter in\n\t      turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If parameter is\n\t      an array variable subscripted with @ or *, the pattern removal\n\t      operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and\n\t      the expansion is the resultant list.\n\n       ${parameter/pattern/string}\n\t      The pattern is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname\n\t      expansion.  Parameter is expanded and the longest match of\n\t      pattern against its value is replaced with string.  If Ipattern\n\t      begins with /, all matches of pattern are replaced with string.\n\t      Normally only the first match is replaced.  If pattern begins\n\t      with #, it must match at the beginning of the expanded value of\n\t      parameter.  If pattern begins with %, it must match at the end\n\t      of the expanded value of parameter.  If string is null, matches\n\t      of pattern are deleted and the / following pattern may be\n\t      omitted.\tIf parameter is @ or *, the substitution operation is\n\t      applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion\n\t      is the resultant list.  If parameter is an array variable\n\t      subscripted with @ or *, the substitution operation is applied\n\t      to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the\n\t      resultant list.\n\n   Command Substitution\n       Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the\n       command name.

    Manpage text:

    Explicit null arguments ("" or '') are retained.  Unquoted implicit
           null arguments, resulting from the expansion of parameters that have no
           values, are removed.  If a parameter with no value is expanded within
           double quotes, a null argument results and is retained.

           Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.

       Pathname Expansion
           After word splitting, unless the -f option has been set, bash scans
           each word for the characters *, ?, and [.  If one of these characters
           appears, then the word is regarded as a pattern, and replaced with an
           alphabetically sorted list of file names matching the pattern.  If no
           matching file names are found, and the shell option nullglob is
           disabled, the word is left unchanged.  If the nullglob option is set,
           and no matches are found, the word is removed.  If the failglob shell
           option is set, and no matches are found, an error message is printed
           and the command is not executed.  If the shell option nocaseglob is
           enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of
           alphabetic characters.  When a pattern is used for pathname expansion,
           the character ``.'' at the start of a name or immediately following a
           slash must be matched explicitly, unless the shell option dotglob is
           set.  When matching a pathname, the slash character must always be
           matched explicitly.  In other cases, the ``.'' character is not treated
           specially.  See the description of shopt below under SHELL BUILTIN
           COMMANDS for a description of the nocaseglob, nullglob, failglob, and

    Manpage text:

    The GLOBIGNORE shell variable may be used to restrict the set of file
           names matching a pattern.  If GLOBIGNORE is set, each matching file
           name that also matches one of the patterns in GLOBIGNORE is removed
           from the list of matches.  The file names ``.'' and ``..'' are always
           ignored when GLOBIGNORE is set and not null.  However, setting
           GLOBIGNORE to a non-null value has the effect of enabling the dotglob
           shell option, so all other file names beginning with a ``.'' will
           match.  To get the old behavior of ignoring file names beginning with a
           ``.'', make ``.*'' one of the patterns in GLOBIGNORE.  The dotglob
           option is disabled when GLOBIGNORE is unset.

           Pattern Matching

           Any character that appears in a pattern, other than the special pattern
           characters described below, matches itself.  The NUL character may not
           occur in a pattern.  A backslash escapes the following character; the
           escaping backslash is discarded when matching.  The special pattern
           characters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally.

    Quote Removal
           After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the
           characters \, ', and " that did not result from one of the above
           expansions are removed.

    REDIRECTION
           Before a command is executed, its input and output may be redirected
           using a special notation interpreted by the shell.  Redirection may
           also be used to open and close files for the current shell execution
           environment.  The following redirection operators may precede or appear
           anywhere within a simple command or may follow a command.  Redirections
           are processed in the order they appear, from left to right.

           In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is
           omitted, and the first character of the redirection operator is <, the
           redirection refers to the standard input (file descriptor 0).  If the
           first character of the redirection operator is >, the redirection
           refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1).

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `bash`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe format of here-documents is:\n\n\t      <<[-]word\n\t\t      here-document\n\t      delimiter\n\n       No parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, or\n       pathname expansion is performed on word.  If any characters in word are\n       quoted, the delimiter is the result of quote removal on word, and the\n       lines in the here-document are not expanded.  If word is unquoted, all\n       lines of the here-document are subjected to parameter expansion,\n       command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.\tIn the latter case,\n       the character sequence \\<newline> is ignored, and \\ must be used to\n       quote the characters \\, $, and `.\n\n       If the redirection operator is <<-, then all leading tab characters are\n       stripped from input lines and the line containing delimiter.  This\n       allows here-documents within shell scripts to be indented in a natural\n       fashion.\n\n   Here Strings\n       A variant of here documents, the format is:\n\n\t      <<<word\n\n       The word is expanded and supplied to the command on its standard input.\n\n   Duplicating File Descriptors\n       The redirection operator\n\n\t      [n]<&word\n\n       is used to duplicate input file descriptors.  If word expands to one or\n       more digits, the file descriptor denoted by n is made to be a copy of\n       that file descriptor.  If the digits in word do not specify a file\n       descriptor open for input, a redirection error occurs.  If word\n       evaluates to -, file descriptor n is closed.  If n is not specified,\n       the standard input (file descriptor 0) is used.\n\n       The operator\n\n\t      [n]>&word\n\n       is used similarly to duplicate output file descriptors.\tIf n is not\n       specified, the standard output (file descriptor 1) is used.  If the\n       digits in word do not specify a file descriptor open for output, a\n       redirection error occurs.  As a special case, if n is omitted, and word\n       does not expand to one or more digits, the standard output and standard\n       error are redirected as described previously.\n\n   Moving File Descriptors\n       The redirection operator\n\n\t      [n]<&digit-\n\n       moves the file descriptor digit to file descriptor n, or the standard\n       input (file descriptor 0) if n is not specified.  digit is closed after\n       being duplicated to n.\n\n       Similarly, the redirection operator\n\n\t      [n]>&digit-\n\n       moves the file descriptor digit to file descriptor n, or the standard\n       output (file descriptor 1) if n is not specified.\n\n   Opening File Descriptors for Reading and Writing\n       The redirection operator\n\n\t      [n]<>word\n\n       causes the file whose name is the expansion of word to be opened for\n       both reading and writing on file descriptor n, or on file descriptor 0\n       if n is not specified.  If the file does not exist, it is created.\n\nALIASES\n       Aliases allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as\n       the first word of a simple command.  The shell maintains a list of\n       aliases that may be set and unset with the alias and unalias builtin\n       commands (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  The first word of each\n       simple command, if unquoted, is checked to see if it has an alias.  If\n       so, that word is replaced by the text of the alias.  The characters /,\n       $, `, and = and any of the shell metacharacters or quoting characters\n       listed above may not appear in an alias name.  The replacement text may\n       contain any valid shell input, including shell metacharacters.  The\n       first word of the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word\n       that is identical to an alias being expanded is not expanded a second\n       time.  This means that one may alias ls to ls -F, for instance, and\n       bash does not try to recursively expand the replacement text.  If the\n       last character of the alias value is a blank, then the next command\n       word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.\n\n       Aliases are created and listed with the alias command, and removed with\n       the unalias command.\n\n       There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text.  If\n       arguments are needed, a shell function should be used (see FUNCTIONS\n       below).\n\n       Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the\n       expand_aliases shell option is set using shopt (see the description of\n       shopt under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).\n\n       The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat\n       confusing.  Bash always reads at least one complete line of input\n       before executing any of the commands on that line.  Aliases are\n       expanded when a command is read, not when it is executed.  Therefore,\n       an alias definition appearing on the same line as another command does\n       not take effect until the next line of input is read.  The commands\n       following the alias definition on that line are not affected by the new\n       alias.  This behavior is also an issue when functions are executed.\n       Aliases are expanded when a function definition is read, not when the\n       function is executed, because a function definition is itself a\n       compound command.  As a consequence, aliases defined in a function are\n       not available until after that function is executed.  To be safe,\n       always put alias definitions on a separate line, and do not use alias\n       in compound commands.\n\n       For almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions.\n\nFUNCTIONS\n       A shell function, defined as described above under SHELL GRAMMAR,\n       stores a series of commands for later execution.  When the name of a\n       shell function is used as a simple command name, the list of commands\n       associated with that function name is executed.\tFunctions are executed\n       in the context of the current shell; no new process is created to\n       interpret them (contrast this with the execution of a shell script).\n       When a function is executed, the arguments to the function become the\n       positional parameters during its execution.  The special parameter # is\n       updated to reflect the change.  Special parameter 0 is unchanged.  The\n       first element of the FUNCNAME variable is set to the name of the\n       function while the function is executing.  All other aspects of the\n       shell execution environment are identical between a function and its\n       caller with the exception that the DEBUG and RETURN traps (see the\n       description of the trap builtin under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) are\n       not inherited unless the function has been given the trace attribute\n       (see the description of the declare builtin below) or the -o functrace\n       shell option has been enabled with the set builtin (in which case all\n       functions inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps).\n\n       Variables local to the function may be declared with the local builtin\n       command.  Ordinarily, variables and their values are shared between the\n       function and its caller.\n\n       If the builtin command return is executed in a function, the function\n       completes and execution resumes with the next command after the\n       function call.  Any command associated with the RETURN trap is executed\n       before execution resumes.  When a function completes, the values of the\n       positional parameters and the special parameter # are restored to the\n       values they had prior to the function's execution.\n\n       Function names and definitions may be listed with the -f option to the\n       declare or typeset builtin commands.  The -F option to declare or\n       typeset will list the function names only (and optionally the source\n       file and line number, if the extdebug shell option is enabled).\n       Functions may be exported so that subshells automatically have them\n       defined with the -f option to the export builtin.  A function\n       definition may be deleted using the -f option to the unset builtin.\n       Note that shell functions and variables with the same name may result\n       in multiple identically-named entries in the environment passed to the\n       shell's children.  Care should be taken in cases where this may cause a\n       problem.\n\n       Functions may be recursive.  No limit is imposed on the number of\n       recursive calls.\n\nARITHMETIC EVALUATION\n       The shell allows arithmetic expressions to be evaluated, under certain\n       circumstances (see the let and declare builtin commands and Arithmetic\n       Expansion).  Evaluation is done in fixed-width integers with no check\n       for overflow, though division by 0 is trapped and flagged as an error.\n       The operators and their precedence, associativity, and values are the\n       same as in the C language.  The following list of operators is grouped\n       into levels of equal-precedence operators.  The levels are listed in\n       order of decreasing precedence.\n\n       id++ id--\n\t      variable post-increment and post-decrement\n       ++id --id\n\t      variable pre-increment and pre-decrement\n       - +    unary minus and plus\n       ! ~    logical and bitwise negation\n       **     exponentiation\n       * / %  multiplication, division, remainder\n       + -    addition, subtraction\n       << >>  left and right bitwise shifts\n       <= >= < >\n\t      comparison\n       == !=  equality and inequality\n       &      bitwise AND\n       ^      bitwise exclusive OR\n       |      bitwise OR\n       &&     logical AND\n       ||     logical OR\n       expr?expr:expr\n\t      conditional operator\n       = *= /= %= += -= <<= >>= &= ^= |=\n\t      assignment\n       expr1 , expr2\n\t      comma\n\n       Shell variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is\n       performed before the expression is evaluated.  Within an expression,\n       shell variables may also be referenced by name without using the\n       parameter expansion syntax.  A shell variable that is null or unset\n       evaluates to 0 when referenced by name without using the parameter\n       expansion syntax.  The value of a variable is evaluated as an\n       arithmetic expression when it is referenced, or when a variable which\n       has been given the integer attribute using declare -i is assigned a\n       value.  A null value evaluates to 0.  A shell variable need not have\n       its integer attribute turned on to be used in an expression.\n\n       Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as octal numbers.  A leading\n       0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal.  Otherwise, numbers take the form\n       [base#]n, where base is a decimal number between 2 and 64 representing\n       the arithmetic base, and n is a number in that base.  If base# is\n       omitted, then base 10 is used.  The digits greater than 9 are\n       represented by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _,\n       in that order.

Arg1 and arg2 may be positive\n\t      or negative integers.\n\nSIMPLE COMMAND EXPANSION\n       When a simple command is executed, the shell performs the following\n       expansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to right.\n\n       1.     The words that the parser has marked as variable assignments\n\t      (those preceding the command name) and redirections are saved\n\t      for later processing.\n\n       2.     The words that are not variable assignments or redirections are\n\t      expanded.  If any words remain after expansion, the first word\n\t      is taken to be the name of the command and the remaining words\n\t      are the arguments.\n\n       3.     Redirections are performed as described above under REDIRECTION.\n\n       4.     The text after the = in each variable assignment undergoes tilde\n\t      expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic\n\t      expansion, and quote removal before being assigned to the\n\t      variable.\n\n       If no command name results, the variable assignments affect the current\n       shell environment.  Otherwise, the variables are added to the\n       environment of the executed command and do not affect the current shell\n       environment.  If any of the assignments attempts to assign a value to a\n       readonly variable, an error occurs, and the command exits with a non-\n       zero status.\n\n       If no command name results, redirections are performed, but do not\n       affect the current shell environment.  A redirection error causes the\n       command to exit with a non-zero status.\n\n       If there is a command name left after expansion, execution proceeds as\n       described below.  Otherwise, the command exits.\tIf one of the\n       expansions contained a command substitution, the exit status of the\n       command is the exit status of the last command substitution performed.\n       If there were no command substitutions, the command exits with a status\n       of zero.\n\nCOMMAND EXECUTION\n       After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple\n       command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are\n       taken.\n\n       If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate\n       it.  If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is\n       invoked as described above in FUNCTIONS.  If the name does not match a\n       function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.  If\n       a match is found, that builtin is invoked.\n\n       If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no\n       slashes, bash searches each element of the PATH for a directory\n       containing an executable file by that name.  Bash uses a hash table to\n       remember the full pathnames of executable files (see hash under SHELL\n       BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  A full search of the directories in PATH is\n       performed only if the command is not found in the hash table.  If the\n       search is unsuccessful, the shell prints an error message and returns\n       an exit status of 127.\n\n       If the search is successful, or if the command name contains one or\n       more slashes, the shell executes the named program in a separate\n       execution environment.  Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the\n       remaining arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if\n       any.\n\n       If this execution fails because the file is not in executable format,\n       and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a shell script, a\n       file containing shell commands.\tA subshell is spawned to execute it.\n       This subshell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a new\n       shell had been invoked to handle the script, with the exception that\n       the locations of commands remembered by the parent (see hash below\n       under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS) are retained by the child.\n\n       If the program is a file beginning with #!, the remainder of the first\n       line specifies an interpreter for the program.  The shell executes the\n       specified interpreter on operating systems that do not handle this\n       executable format themselves.  The arguments to the interpreter consist\n       of a single optional argument following the interpreter name on the\n       first line of the program, followed by the name of the program,\n       followed by the command arguments, if any.\n\nCOMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT\n       The shell has an execution environment, which consists of the\n       following:"

    If a command is followed by a & and job control is not active, the
           default standard input for the command is the empty file /dev/null.
           Otherwise, the invoked command inherits the file descriptors of the
           calling shell as modified by redirections.

    ENVIRONMENT
           When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the
           environment.  This is a list of name-value pairs, of the form
           name=value.

           The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment.  On
           invocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter
           for each name found, automatically marking it for export to child
           processes.  Executed commands inherit the environment.  The export and
           declare -x commands allow parameters and functions to be added to and
           deleted from the environment.  If the value of a parameter in the
           environment is modified, the new value becomes part of the environment,
           replacing the old.  The environment inherited by any executed command
           consists of the shell's initial environment, whose values may be
           modified in the shell, less any pairs removed by the unset command,
           plus any additions via the export and declare -x commands.

    The environment for any simple command or function may be augmented
           temporarily by prefixing it with parameter assignments, as described
           above in PARAMETERS.  These assignment statements affect only the
           environment seen by that command.

           If the -k option is set (see the set builtin command below), then all
           parameter assignments are placed in the environment for a command, not
           just those that precede the command name.

           When bash invokes an external command, the variable _ is set to the
           full file name of the command and passed to that command in its
           environment.

    EXIT STATUS
           For the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status
           has succeeded.  An exit status of zero indicates success.  A non-zero
           exit status indicates failure.  When a command terminates on a fatal
           signal N, bash uses the value of 128+N as the exit status.

           If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it
           returns a status of 127.  If a command is found but is not executable,
           the return status is 126.

    Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the

           readline displays the next entry from the history matching the string
           typed so far.  An incremental search requires only as many characters
           as needed to find the desired history entry.  The characters present in
           the value of the isearch-terminators variable are used to terminate an
           incremental search.  If that variable has not been assigned a value the
           Escape and Control-J characters will terminate an incremental search.
           Control-G will abort an incremental search and restore the original
           line.  When the search is terminated, the history entry containing the
           search string becomes the current line.

           To find other matching entries in the history list, type Control-S or
           Control-R as appropriate.  This will search backward or forward in the

Only matches\n       which are prefixed by the word being completed are returned.

    When a compspec indicates that directory name completion is desired,
           the programmable completion functions force readline to append a slash
           to completed names which are symbolic links to directories, subject to
           the value of the mark-directories readline variable, regardless of the
           setting of the mark-symlinked-directories readline variable.

    HISTORY
           When the -o history option to the set builtin is enabled, the shell
           provides access to the command history, the list of commands previously
           typed.  The value of the HISTSIZE variable is used as the number of
           commands to save in a history list.  The text of the last HISTSIZE
           commands (default 500) is saved.  The shell stores each command in the
           history list prior to parameter and variable expansion (see EXPANSION
           above) but after history expansion is performed, subject to the values
           of the shell variables HISTIGNORE and HISTCONTROL.

           On startup, the history is initialized from the file named by the
           variable HISTFILE (default ~/.bash_history).  The file named by the
           value of HISTFILE is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than
           the number of lines specified by the value of HISTFILESIZE.  When an
           interactive shell exits, the last $HISTSIZE lines are copied from the
           history list to $HISTFILE.  If the histappend shell option is enabled
           (see the description of shopt under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below), the
           lines are appended to the history file, otherwise the history file is
           overwritten.  If HISTFILE is unset, or if the history file is
           unwritable, the history is not saved.  After saving the history, the
           history file is truncated to contain no more than HISTFILESIZE lines.
           If HISTFILESIZE is not set, no truncation is performed.

    The builtin command fc (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) may be used

    HISTORY EXPANSION
           The shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar to the
           history expansion in csh.  This section describes what syntax features
           are available.  This feature is enabled by default for interactive
           shells, and can be disabled using the +H option to the set builtin
           command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  Non-interactive shells do
           not perform history expansion by default.

           History expansions introduce words from the history list into the input
           stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to a
           previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous
           commands quickly.

           History expansion is performed immediately after a complete line is
           read, before the shell breaks it into words.  It takes place in two
           parts.  The first is to determine which line from the history list to
           use during substitution.  The second is to select portions of that line
           for inclusion into the current one.  The line selected from the history
           is the event, and the portions of that line that are acted upon are
           words.  Various modifiers are available to manipulate the selected
           words.  The line is broken into words in the same fashion as when
           reading input, so that several metacharacter-separated words surrounded
           by quotes are considered one word.  History expansions are introduced
           by the appearance of the history expansion character, which is ! by
           default.  Only backslash (\) and single quotes can quote the history
           expansion character.

If -a is\n\t      supplied, the list printed includes all builtins, with an\n\t      indication of whether or not each is enabled.  If -s is\n\t      supplied, the output is restricted to the POSIX special\n\t      builtins.  The return value is 0 unless a name is not a shell\n\t      builtin or there is an error loading a new builtin from a shared\n\t      object."

    BUGS
           It's too big and too slow.

           There are some subtle differences between bash and traditional versions
           of sh, mostly because of the POSIX specification.

           Aliases are confusing in some uses.

           Shell builtin commands and functions are not stoppable/restartable.

           Compound commands and command sequences of the form `a ; b ; c' are not
           handled gracefully when process suspension is attempted.  When a
           process is stopped, the shell immediately executes the next command in
           the sequence.  It suffices to place the sequence of commands between
           parentheses to force it into a subshell, which may be stopped as a
           unit.
