Add --dynamic after --libs to print only shared\n\t       library linking information.\n\n       --cflags\n\t       Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a GNOME-\n\t       XML program.\n\n       --prefix=PREFIX\n\t       If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix\n\t       that GNOME-XML was built with when computing the output for the\n\t       --cflags and --libs options. This option must be specified\n\t       before any --libs or --cflags options."
