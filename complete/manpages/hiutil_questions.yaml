It\n     is also capable of examining Spotlight help indices using the modes\n     listed below. To examine LSM indices, use a version of hiutil earlier\n     than 2.0.\n\n     Spotlight help indices are required in macOS Mojave or later. Spotlight\n     indices are not compatible with versions earlier than macOS Mojave.\n\n     The macOS help system automatically generates indices for local help\n     books (see ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.helpd/). If your help content will\n     be hosted remotely, you may want to manually generate an index to include\n     with your remote help book."
