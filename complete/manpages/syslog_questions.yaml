A single\n     argument causes a match to occur if a message has the specified key,\n     regardless of value.  If two arguments are specified, a match occurs when\n     a message has exactly the specified value for a given key.  For example,\n     to find all messages sent by the portmap process:\n\n\t   syslog -k Sender portmap\n\n     Note that the -C option is treated as an alias for the expression:\n\n\t   -k Facility com.apple.console\n\n     This provides a quick way to search for console messages.\n\n     If three arguments are given, they are of the form -k key operation\n     value.  syslog supports the following matching operators:\n\n     eq   equal\n     ne   not equal\n     gt   greater than\n     ge   greater than or equal to\n     lt   less than\n     le   less than or equal to\n\n     Additionally, the operator may be preceded by one or more of the\n     following modifiers:\n\n     C\t  case-fold\n     R\t  regular expression (see regex(3))\n     S\t  substring\n     A\t  prefix\n     Z\t  suffix\n     N\t  numeric comparison"

A complex expression that has more than one “-k key\n     [[op] val]” term matches a message if all of the key-value operations\n     match.  Logically, the result is an AND of all of key-value operations.\n     For example:\n\n\t   syslog -k Sender portmap -k Time ge -2h\n\n     finds all messages sent by portmap in the last 2 hours (-2h means \"two\n     hours ago\").\n\n     The -o option may be used to build even more complex searches by\n     providing an OR operation.  If two or more sub-expressions are given,\n     separated by -o options, then a match occurs is a message matches any of\n     the sub-expressions.  For example, to find all messages which have either\n     a “Sender” value of “portmap” or that have a numeric priority level of 4\n     or less:\n\n\t   syslog -k Sender portmap -o -k Level Nle 4\n\n     Log priority levels are internally handled as an integer value between 0\n     and 7.
