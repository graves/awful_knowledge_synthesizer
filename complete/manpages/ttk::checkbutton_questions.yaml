The widget sets the\n       alternate state whenever the linked -variable is unset.\t(The alternate\n       state may be used to indicate a “tri-state” or “indeterminate”\n       selection.)\n\nSTANDARD STYLES\n       Ttk::checkbutton widgets support the Toolbutton style in all standard\n       themes, which is useful for creating widgets for toolbars."
