    DESCRIPTION
         This interface is obsoleted by os_log(3).

         These routines provide an interface to the Apple System Log facility and
         to various data bearing memory objects, files, and storage directories.

         The API allows client applications to create and manipulate flexible,
         structured messages, send them to the syslogd server, where they may
         undergo additional processing.  Messages received by the server are saved
         in a data store (subject to input filtering constraints).

         Log messages may also be written directly to the filesystem from the ASL
         library.  This output may go to plain text files, to ASL-format data
         files, or to ASL databases.

         This API permits clients to create queries and search the system ASL
         database, ASL-format files, or other ASL databases for matching messages.

         Clients that simply need to send messages to the ASL server may do so
         using asl_log_message().  Other routines allow for more complex logging
         tasks.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `asl`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nAn introduction to the concepts underlying this interface follows the\n     interface summary below.\n\n   INTERFACE SUMMARY\n     asl_log_message(level, format, ...) sends a message to the ASL server\n     syslogd.  level is an integer between 7 (ASL_LEVEL_DEBUG) and 0\n     (ASL_LEVEL_EMERG), indicating the priority of the message.  Note that\n     message priority levels are used as the basis of filtering messages in\n     several places in the ASL system.\tIn general, messages with level\n     ASL_LEVEL_DEBUG and ASL_LEVEL_INFO are often excluded from long-term\n     storage, or have shorter time-to-live durations.\n\n     format is a printf-like format string.  In addition to the conversion\n     specifications supported by printf, asl_log_message() supports the “%m”\n     conversion, which is converted to the current error string returned by\n     the strerror function for the current value of errno.\n\n     asl_log_message() is a simplified version of the asl_log() interface.  It\n     uses the default (NULL) ASL client handle.  This interface is thread-\n     safe, although callers will contend for a mutex lock when using this\n     routine.  Applications that log from multiple threads or dispatch queues\n     may experience undesired performance characteristics when using this\n     routine.  The use of asl_open() and asl_log(), asl_vlog(), or asl_send()\n     is advised for applications that log from multiple threads."

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use asl_log_message to log a debug-level message with a custom format string and error information?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using asl_log_message to send an informational message with a specific priority level and format?

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `asl`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nasl_log(obj, msg, level, format, ...) prepares a message, normally to be\n     sent to the ASL server syslogd.  The first parameter, obj, may be an\n     asl_object_t of any type.\tIt is typically of type ASL_TYPE_CLIENT.  In\n     this case the settings and options associated with the ASL client handle\n     obj are used when preparing the message.  The client may direct the ASL\n     library to print copies of the message to various output files as well as\n     sending it to the ASL server.  Filter settings in the client may further\n     direct the library in selecting where the message will be sent, and may\n     in fact prevent the message from being sent to the ASL server at all.\n     ASL client handles are created using asl_open() and are described\n     extensively below.\n\n     ASL message are dictionaries.  The asl_log() routine combines information\n     carried in the ASL client handle client and the ASL message dictionary\n     msg, together with the format string and the associated arguments to\n     construct a final message to be sent to the ASL server and/or to be\n     written to output files.  In general, the ASL client handle will provide\n     the values for the ASL_KEY_SENDER and ASL_KEY_FACILITY keys.  If msg is\n     non-NULL, it may override the values for ASL_KEY_SENDER and\n     ASL_KEY_FACILITY, and it may supply additional key/value pairs.  The\n     format string and its associated arguments are used to construct a string\n     value for the ASL_KEY_MSG key in the final log message dictionary."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `asl`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIf the obj parameter is of a type other than ASL_TYPE_CLIENT, then\n     asl_log() creates a message as if it were to be sent to syslogd, but\n     rather than sending the message, it stores the message in the obj\n     provided.\tIf obj is of type ASL_TYPE_FILE or ASL_TYPE_STORE that has\n     been opened for writing, then the message is saved to the file or ASL\n     data store.  If obj is of type ASL_TYPE_LIST, then the message is\n     appended to the list.  If obj is of type ASL_TYPE_MSG, then the message\n     key/value pairs constructed by asl_log() are merged with obj.  In a merge\n     operation, existing keys and values in obj are preserved.\tNew values in\n     the asl_log() message are attached.  Although this routine works for type\n     ASL_TYPE_QUERY, new key/value pairs are attached with an operation value\n     of zero.\n\n     The ASL_PREFILTER_LOG(obj, msg, level, format, ...) macro may be used in\n     place of asl_log() when obj is of type ASL_TYPE_CLIENT.  The macro avoids\n     processing the variable argument list in those cases where the message\n     would be filtered out due to filter settings, would not be written to a\n     log file associated with the asl_object_t, or would not be written to\n     stderr.  The macro may provide a performance benefit for some\n     applications.  Details on filter setting, additional log files, and\n     asl_object_t options are described below in this manual."

    Manpage text:

    asl_close(asl) closes the client handle asl and releases its associated
         resources.  asl_release() may also be used to close a client handle.

         asl_set_filter(asl, f) sets a filter for messages being sent to the
         server.  The filter is a bitmask representing priority levels.  Only
         messages having a priority level with a corresponding bit set in the
         filter mask are sent to the syslogd server.  The filter does not control
         writes to additional files associated with the client handle using
         asl_add_output_file().  asl_set_filter() returns the previous filter
         value.

         asl_add_output_file(asl, descriptor, msg_fmt, time_fmt, filter,
         text_encoding) adds the file descriptor descriptor to the a set of file
         descriptors associated with the client handle asl.  Each log message sent
         by that client handle is also written to these file descriptors
         (depending on the setting of the filter argument).  The message format is
         specified by the msg_fmt argument.  The format for timestamps is
         specified by the time_fmt argument, although custom format strings may

         in the list.  For ASL_TYPE_FILE, returns the number of messages contained
         in the file.  Returns zero for ASL_TYPE_STORE and ASL_TYPE_CLIENT.

         asl_append(obj, msg) appends the msg object, which is typically of type
         ASL_TYPE_MSG or ASL_TYPE_QUERY, to the target obj.  The target obj is
         typically a type that contains a collection of messages, i.e.

    asl_prev(obj) is similar to asl_next(), except that it returns objects in

         item and move the index forward or backward.  The index position can be
         set using asl_reset_iteration().

         asl_reset_iteration(obj, position) sets the current position index used
         be asl_next() and asl_prev().  The value of position may be zero to set
         the position index for obj at the beginning of its contents, or it may be
         SIZE_MAX to set the position index for obj at the end of its contents.
         For objects of type ASL_TYPE_LIST, the position index is an actual index

         asl_log_descriptor(asl, msg, level, descriptor, fd_type) provides
         functionality to use file descriptors to send logging data to ASL.  asl
         is retained by ASL and must still be closed by the caller by calling
         asl_close() if the caller loses reference to it.  msg is copied by ASL

    If fd_type is ASL_LOG_DESCRIPTOR_WRITE, the descriptor is closed and a
         new writable descriptor is created with the same fileno.  Any data
         written to this new descriptor are line buffered and passed to asl_log().
         When EOF is sent, no further data are read.  The caller is responsible
         for closing the new descriptor.  One common use for this API is to
         redirect writes to stdout or stderr to ASL by passing STDOUT_FILENO or
         STDERR_FILENO as descriptor.

         asl_search(obj, query) searches messages in the obj object for messages
         that match the keys and values in query, subject to matching operations
         associated with those keys and values.  The return returns an object of
         type ASL_TYPE_LIST containing matching messages, or NULL if no matches
         are found.  The query argument should be constructed using
         asl_set_query().  See the SEARCHING section for details on constructing
         queries.

         The obj parameter may be any ASL object.  For type ASL_TYPE_CLIENT, the
         main ASL system database is searched.  If the object type is
         ASL_TYPE_STORE or ASL_TYPE_FILE, then the corresponding data store or
         data file is searched.  For ASL_TYPE_LIST, matches are found in a message
         list.  If obj is of type ASL_TYPE_MSG and query is of type
         ASL_TYPE_QUERY, obj is matched against the query, and a list containing
         obj is returned if the match succeeds.  If both obj and query are objects
         of type ASL_TYPE_MSG or both are of type ASL_TYPE_QUERY, they are tested
         for exact match.  A list containing obj is returned if the match is

         ASL_TYPE_MSG, the routine returns NULL.

    Although the ASL system does not require a "Facility" key in a message,
         many processes specify a "Facility" value similar to the common usage of
         the BSD syslog API, although developers are encouraged to adopt facility
         names that make sense for their application.  A “Reverse ICANN” naming
         convention (e.g. "com.apple.system.syslog") should be adopted to avoid
         conflicting names.  The ASL system generally allows any string to be used
         as a facility value, with one exception.  The value "com.apple.system",
         or any string that has "com.apple.system" as a prefix, may only be used
         by processes running with the UID 0.  This allows system processes to log
         messages that can not be "spoofed" by user processes.  Non-UID 0 client
         processes that specify "com.apple.system" as a facility, will be assigned
         the value "user" by the syslogd server.

       CLIENT HANDLES
         A client handle contains various parameters and control settings that are
         used when a message is logged.  This includes an identification string, a
         facility name, filtering controls, additional file descriptors, and other
         data.  Client handles are not thread-safe.  Applications that log from
         multiple threads should create a client handle for each thread.

    Applications that use libdispatch must also avoid using a single client
         handle from multiple dispatch queues if those queues may run
         concurrently.  A good approach is to create one or more serial dispatch
         queues specifically for logging.  Each such queue should use its own ASL
         client handle.

         If a single handle must be accessed by multiple dispatch queues, then the
         application must use locks, semaphores, or some other mechanism to
         prevent concurrent access to a client handle.

         A NULL value may be used in any of the routines that require an
         asl_object_t argument.  In this case, the library will use an internal
         client handle.  This internal handle contains its own lock, allowing
         multiple threads to safely use the NULL client handle.  Note, however,
         that contention for the lock may cause undesirable synchronization
         behavior or reduced performance.

         The asl_open() routine may be given an ident argument, which becomes the
         default value for the ASL_KEY_SENDER key, and a facility argument, which
         becomes the value associated with the ASL_KEY_FACILITY key.  If NULL is
         passed as the value for ident, the name of the currently running program
         will be used.  If NULL is passed as the value for facility, the value
         “user” will be used for non UID 0 processes, and “” daemon will be used
         for UID 0 processes.

This\n     means that by default, and in the absence of remote-control changes\n     (described below), ASL_LEVEL_DEBUG and ASL_LEVEL_INFO priority level\n     messages are not sent to the syslogd server."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `asl`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThree different filters exist for each application.  The first is the\n     filter mask set using asl_set_filter() as described above.  The Apple\n     System Log facility also manages a “master” filter mask.  The master\n     filter mask usually has a value that indicates to the library that it is\n     “off”, and thus it has no effect.\tHowever, the mask filter mask may be\n     enabled by giving it a value using the syslog command, using the -c 0\n     option.  When the master filter mask has been set, it takes precedence\n     over the client's filter mask.  The client's mask is unmodified, and will\n     become active again if remote-control filtering is disabled.\n\n     In addition to the master filter mask, The Apple System Log facility also\n     manages a per-client remote-control filter mask.  Like the master filter\n     mask, the per-client mask is usually “off”, having no effect on a client.\n     If a per-client filter mask is set using the syslog command, using the -c\n     process option, then it takes precedence over both the client's filter\n     mask and the master filter mask.  As is the case with the master filter\n     mask, a per-client mask ceases having any effect when if is disabled."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `asl`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe ASL_OPT_NO_REMOTE option to asl_open() causes both the master and\n     per-client remote-control masks to be ignored in the library.  In that\n     case, only the client's own filter mask is used to determine which\n     messages are sent to the server.  This may be useful for Applications\n     that produce log messages that should never be filtered, due to security\n     considerations.  Note that root (administrator) access is required to set\n     or change the master filter mask, and that only root may change a per-\n     client remote-control filter mask for a root (UID 0) process.\n\n     The per-process remote control filter value is kept as a state value\n     associated with a key managed by notifyd.\tThe key is protected by an\n     access control mechanism that only permits the filter value to be\n     accessed and modified by the same effective UID as the ASL client at the\n     time that the first ASL connection was created.  Remote filter control\n     using syslog -c will fail for processes that change effective UID after\n     starting an ASL connection.  Those processes should close all ASL client\n     handles and then re-open ASL connections if remote filter control support\n     is desired."
