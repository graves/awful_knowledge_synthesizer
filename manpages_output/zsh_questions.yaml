    Manpage text:

    Zsh has command line editing, builtin spelling correction, programmable
           command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history
           mechanism, and a host of other features.

    AUTHOR
           Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad.  Zsh is now maintained by
           the members of the zsh-workers mailing list <zsh-workers@zsh.org>.  The
           development is currently coordinated by Peter Stephenson <pws@zsh.org>.
           The coordinator can be contacted at <coordinator@zsh.org>, but matters
           relating to the code should generally go to the mailing list.

    AVAILABILITY
           Zsh is available from the following HTTP and anonymous FTP site.

           ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/
           https://www.zsh.org/pub/

           The up-to-date source code is available via Git from Sourceforge.  See

    After the first one or two arguments have been appropriated as
           described above, the remaining arguments are assigned to the positional
           parameters.

           For further options, which are common to invocation and the set
           builtin, see zshoptions(1).

           The long option `--emulate' followed (in a separate word) by an
           emulation mode may be passed to the shell.  The emulation modes are
           those described for the emulate builtin, see zshbuiltins(1).  The
           `--emulate' option must precede any other options (which might
           otherwise be overridden), but following options are honoured, so may be
           used to modify the requested emulation mode.  Note that certain extra
           steps are taken to ensure a smooth emulation when this option is used
           compared with the emulate command within the shell: for example,
           variables that conflict with POSIX usage such as path are not defined
           within the shell.

           Options may be specified by name using the -o option.  -o acts like a
           single-letter option, but takes a following string as the option name.

    zsh -x -o shwordsplit scr

           runs the script scr, setting the XTRACE option by the corresponding
           letter `-x' and the SH_WORD_SPLIT option by name.  Options may be
           turned off by name by using +o instead of -o.  -o can be stacked up
           with preceding single-letter options, so for example `-xo shwordsplit'
           or `-xoshwordsplit' is equivalent to `-x -o shwordsplit'.

           Options may also be specified by name in GNU long option style,
           `--option-name'.  When this is done, `-' characters in the option name
           are permitted: they are translated into `_', and thus ignored.  So, for
           example, `zsh --sh-word-split' invokes zsh with the SH_WORD_SPLIT
           option turned on.  Like other option syntaxes, options can be turned
           off by replacing the initial `-' with a `+'; thus `+-sh-word-split' is
           equivalent to `--no-sh-word-split'.  Unlike other option syntaxes,
           GNU-style long options cannot be stacked with any other options, so for
           example `-x-shwordsplit' is an error, rather than being treated like
           `-x --shwordsplit'.

    The special GNU-style option `--version' is handled; it sends to
           standard output the shell's version information, then exits
           successfully.  `--help' is also handled; it sends to standard output a
           list of options that can be used when invoking the shell, then exits
           successfully.

           Option processing may be finished, allowing following arguments that
           start with `-' or `+' to be treated as normal arguments, in two ways.
           Firstly, a lone `-' (or `+') as an argument by itself ends option
           processing.  Secondly, a special option `--' (or `+-'), which may be
           specified on its own (which is the standard POSIX usage) or may be
           stacked with preceding options (so `-x-' is equivalent to `-x --').
           Options are not permitted to be stacked after `--' (so `-x-f' is an
           error), but note the GNU-style option form discussed above, where
           `--shwordsplit' is permitted and does not end option processing.

           Except when the sh/ksh emulation single-letter options are in effect,
           the option `-b' (or `+b') ends option processing.  `-b' is like `--',
           except that further single-letter options can be stacked after the `-b'
           and will take effect as normal.

    Restricted mode can also be activated any time by setting the
           RESTRICTED option.  This immediately enables all the restrictions
           described above even if the shell still has not processed all startup
           files.

           A shell Restricted Mode is an outdated way to restrict what users may
           do:  modern systems have better, safer and more reliable ways to
           confine user actions, such as chroot jails, containers and zones.

           A restricted shell is very difficult to implement safely.  The feature
           may be removed in a future version of zsh.

           It is important to realise that the restrictions only apply to the
           shell, not to the commands it runs (except for some shell builtins).
           While a restricted shell can only run the restricted list of commands
           accessible via the predefined `PATH' variable, it does not prevent
           those commands from running any other command.

           As an example, if `env' is among the list of allowed commands, then it
           allows the user to run any command as `env' is not a shell builtin
           command and can run arbitrary executables.

    Manpage text:

    So when implementing a restricted shell framework it is important to be
           fully aware of what actions each of the allowed commands or features
           (which may be regarded as modules) can perform.

           Many commands can have their behaviour affected by environment
           variables.  Except for the few listed above, zsh does not restrict the
           setting of environment variables.

           If a `perl', `python', `bash', or other general purpose interpreted
           script it treated as a restricted command, the user can work around the
           restriction by setting specially crafted `PERL5LIB', `PYTHONPATH',
           `BASHENV' (etc.) environment variables. On GNU systems, any command can
           be made to run arbitrary code when performing character set conversion
           (including zsh itself) by setting a `GCONV_PATH' environment variable.
           Those are only a few examples.

           Bear in mind that, contrary to some other shells, `readonly' is not a
           security feature in zsh as it can be undone and so cannot be used to
           mitigate the above.

    Manpage text:

    A restricted shell only works if the allowed commands are few and
           carefully written so as not to grant more access to users than
           intended.  It is also important to restrict what zsh module the user
           may load as some of them, such as `zsh/system', `zsh/mapfile' and
           `zsh/files', allow bypassing most of the restrictions.

    STARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES
           Commands are first read from /etc/zshenv; this cannot be overridden.
           Subsequent behaviour is modified by the RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options; the
           former affects all startup files, while the second only affects global
           startup files (those shown here with an path starting with a /).  If
           one of the options is unset at any point, any subsequent startup
           file(s) of the corresponding type will not be read.  It is also
           possible for a file in $ZDOTDIR to re-enable GLOBAL_RCS. Both RCS and
           GLOBAL_RCS are set by default.

           Commands are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv.  If the shell is a login
           shell, commands are read from /etc/zprofile and then
           $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile.  Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are
           read from /etc/zshrc and then $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc.  Finally, if the shell
           is a login shell, /etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zsh`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nWhen a login shell exits, the files $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout and then\n       /etc/zlogout are read.  This happens with either an explicit exit via\n       the exit or logout commands, or an implicit exit by reading end-of-file\n       from the terminal.  However, if the shell terminates due to exec'ing\n       another process, the logout files are not read.\tThese are also\n       affected by the RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options.  Note also that the RCS\n       option affects the saving of history files, i.e. if RCS is unset when\n       the shell exits, no history file will be saved.\n\n       If ZDOTDIR is unset, HOME is used instead.  Files listed above as being\n       in /etc may be in another directory, depending on the installation.\n\n       As /etc/zshenv is run for all instances of zsh, it is important that it\n       be kept as small as possible.  In particular, it is a good idea to put\n       code that does not need to be run for every single shell behind a test\n       of the form `if [[ -o rcs ]]; then ...' so that it will not be executed\n       when zsh is invoked with the `-f' option."

    Manpage text:

    Any of these files may be pre-compiled with the zcompile builtin
           command (see zshbuiltins(1)).  If a compiled file exists (named for the
           original file plus the .zwc extension) and it is newer than the
           original file, the compiled file will be used instead.

    FILES
           $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv
           $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile
           $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc
           $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin
           $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
           ${TMPPREFIX}*   (default is /tmp/zsh*)
           /etc/zshenv
           /etc/zprofile
           /etc/zshrc
           /etc/zlogin
           /etc/zlogout    (installation-specific - /etc is the default)
