When both file1 or file2 are\n     specified, either file may be compressed.\n\n     Extensions handled by gzip(1):\n     •\t z, Z,\n     •\t gz,\n     •\t taz,\n     •\t tgz.\n\n     Extensions handled by bzip2(1):\n     •\t bz,\n     •\t bz2,\n     •\t tbz,\n     •\t tbz2.\n\n     Extensions handled by xz(1):\n     •\t lzma,\n     •\t xz,\n     •\t tlz,\n     •\t txz.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n     TMPDIR  Directory in which to place temporary files.  If unset, /tmp is\n\t     used.\n\nFILES\n     /tmp/zcmp.XXXXXXXXXX   Temporary file for zcmp.\n     /tmp/zdiff.XXXXXXXXXX  Temporary file for zdiff."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the zcmp and zdiff commands?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use zdiff to compare two compressed files, one of which is gzip-compressed and the other is bzip2-compressed?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using zcmp to compare a compressed file with its uncompressed counterpart?
