The initial terminal login process\n     getty(8) accesses the gettytab file each time it starts, allowing simpler\n     reconfiguration of terminal characteristics.  Each entry in the data base\n     is used to describe one class of terminals.\n\n     There is a default terminal class, default, that is used to set global\n     defaults for all other classes.  (That is, the default entry is read,\n     then the entry for the class required is used to override particular\n     settings.)\n\nCAPABILITIES\n     Refer to termcap(5) for a description of the file layout.\tThe default\n     column below lists defaults obtained if there is no entry in the table\n     obtained, nor one in the special default table.\n\n     Name    Type    Default\t       Description\n     ac      str     unused\t       expect-send chat script for modem\n\t\t\t\t       answer\n     al      str     unused\t       user to auto-login instead of prompting\n     ap      bool    false\t       terminal uses any parity\n     bk      str     0377\t       alternate end of line character (input\n\t\t\t\t       break)\n     c0      num     unused\t       tty control flags to write messages\n     c1      num     unused\t       tty control flags to read login name\n     c2      num     unused\t       tty control flags to leave terminal as\n     ce      bool    false\t       use crt erase algorithm\n     ck      bool    false\t       use crt kill algorithm\n     cl      str     NULL\t       screen clear sequence\n     co      bool    false\t       console -
