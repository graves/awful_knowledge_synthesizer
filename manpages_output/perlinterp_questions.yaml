    NAME
           perlinterp - An overview of the Perl interpreter

    DESCRIPTION
           This document provides an overview of how the Perl interpreter works at
           the level of C code, along with pointers to the relevant C source code
           files.

    ELEMENTS OF THE INTERPRETER
           The work of the interpreter has two main stages: compiling the code
           into the internal representation, or bytecode, and then executing it.
           "Compiled code" in perlguts explains exactly how the compilation stage
           happens.

           Here is a short breakdown of perl's operation:

       Startup
           The action begins in perlmain.c. (or miniperlmain.c for miniperl) This
           is very high-level code, enough to fit on a single screen, and it
           resembles the code found in perlembed; most of the real action takes
           place in perl.c

           perlmain.c is generated by "ExtUtils::Miniperl" from miniperlmain.c at
           make time, so you should make perl to follow this along.

           First, perlmain.c allocates some memory and constructs a Perl
           interpreter, along these lines:

    Manpage text:

    The parser is nobly assisted by the lexer, which chunks up your input
           into tokens, and decides what type of thing each token is: a variable
           name, an operator, a bareword, a subroutine, a core function, and so
           on. The main point of entry to the lexer is "yylex", and that and its
           associated routines can be found in toke.c. Perl isn't much like other
           computer languages; it's highly context sensitive at times, it can be
           tricky to work out what sort of token something is, or where a token
           ends. As such, there's a lot of interplay between the tokeniser and the
           parser, which can get pretty frightening if you're not used to it.

           As the parser understands a Perl program, it builds up a tree of
           operations for the interpreter to perform during execution. The
           routines which construct and link together the various operations are
           to be found in op.c, and will be examined later.

       Optimization
           Now the parsing stage is complete, and the finished tree represents the
           operations that the Perl interpreter needs to perform to execute our
           program. Next, Perl does a dry run over the tree looking for
           optimisations: constant expressions such as "3 + 4" will be computed
           now, and the optimizer will also see if any multiple operations can be
           replaced with a single one. For instance, to fetch the variable $foo,
           instead of grabbing the glob *foo and looking at the scalar component,
           the optimizer fiddles the op tree to use a function which directly
           looks up the scalar in question. The main optimizer is "peep" in op.c,
           and many ops have their own optimizing functions.

    Manpage text:

    Note that each "pp_" function is expected to return a pointer to the
           next op. Calls to perl subs (and eval blocks) are handled within the
           same runops loop, and do not consume extra space on the C stack. For
           example, "pp_entersub" and "pp_entertry" just push a "CxSUB" or
           "CxEVAL" block struct onto the context stack which contain the address
           of the op following the sub call or eval. They then return the first op
           of that sub or eval block, and so execution continues of that sub or
           block. Later, a "pp_leavesub" or "pp_leavetry" op pops the "CxSUB" or
           "CxEVAL", retrieves the return op from it, and returns it.

       Exception handing
           Perl's exception handing (i.e. "die" etc.) is built on top of the low-
           level "setjmp()"/"longjmp()" C-library functions. These basically
           provide a way to capture the current PC and SP registers and later
           restore them; i.e. a "longjmp()" continues at the point in code where a
           previous "setjmp()" was done, with anything further up on the C stack
           being lost. This is why code should always save values using "SAVE_FOO"
           rather than in auto variables.

The basic rule of perl exceptions is that \"exit\", and\n       \"die\" (in the absence of \"eval\") perform a JMPENV_JUMP(2), while \"die\"\n       within \"eval\" does a JMPENV_JUMP(3).\n\n       At entry points to perl, such as \"perl_parse()\", \"perl_run()\" and\n       \"call_sv(cv, G_EVAL)\" each does a \"JMPENV_PUSH\", then enter a runops\n       loop or whatever, and handle possible exception returns. For a 2\n       return, final cleanup is performed, such as popping stacks and calling\n       \"CHECK\" or \"END\" blocks. Amongst other things, this is how scope\n       cleanup still occurs during an \"exit\".\n\n       If a \"die\" can find a \"CxEVAL\" block on the context stack, then the\n       stack is popped to that level and the return op in that block is\n       assigned to \"PL_restartop\"; then a JMPENV_JUMP(3) is performed.\tThis\n       normally passes control back to the guard. In the case of \"perl_run\"\n       and \"call_sv\", a non-null \"PL_restartop\" triggers re-entry to the\n       runops loop.

In this case, something like\n\n\t   sub FETCH { eval { die } }\n\n       would cause a longjmp right back to the guard in \"perl_run\", popping\n       both runops loops, which is clearly incorrect. One way to avoid this is\n       for the tie code to do a \"JMPENV_PUSH\" before executing \"FETCH\" in the\n       inner runops loop, but for efficiency reasons, perl in fact just sets a\n       flag, using \"CATCH_SET(TRUE)\". The \"pp_require\", \"pp_entereval\" and\n       \"pp_entertry\" ops check this flag, and if true, they call \"docatch\",\n       which does a \"JMPENV_PUSH\" and starts a new runops level to execute the\n       code, rather than doing it on the current loop.\n\n       As a further optimisation, on exit from the eval block in the \"FETCH\",\n       execution of the code following the block is still carried on in the\n       inner loop.

    This is a function which adds a string, "ptr", of length "len" onto the
           end of the PV stored in "sv". The first thing we do in line 6 is make
           sure that the SV has a valid PV, by calling the "SvPV_force" macro to
           force a PV. As a side effect, "tlen" gets set to the current value of
           the PV, and the PV itself is returned to "junk".

           In line 7, we make sure that the SV will have enough room to
           accommodate the old string, the new string and the null terminator. If
           "LEN" isn't big enough, "SvGROW" will reallocate space for us.

           Now, if "junk" is the same as the string we're trying to add, we can
           grab the string directly from the SV; "SvPVX" is the address of the PV
           in the SV.

           Line 10 does the actual catenation: the "Move" macro moves a chunk of
           memory around: we move the string "ptr" to the end of the PV - that's
           the start of the PV plus its current length. We're moving "len" bytes
           of type "char". After doing so, we need to tell Perl we've extended the
           string, by altering "CUR" to reflect the new length. "SvEND" is a macro
           which gives us the end of the string, so that needs to be a "\0".

    Line 13 manipulates the flags; since we've changed the PV, any IV or NV
           values will no longer be valid: if we have "$a=10; $a.="6";" we don't
           want to use the old IV of 10. "SvPOK_only_utf8" is a special
           UTF-8-aware version of "SvPOK_only", a macro which turns off the IOK
           and NOK flags and turns on POK. The final "SvTAINT" is a macro which
           launders tainted data if taint mode is turned on.

           AVs and HVs are more complicated, but SVs are by far the most common
           variable type being thrown around. Having seen something of how we
           manipulate these, let's go on and look at how the op tree is
           constructed.

    OP TREES
           First, what is the op tree, anyway? The op tree is the parsed
           representation of your program, as we saw in our section on parsing,
           and it's the sequence of operations that Perl goes through to execute
           your program, as we saw in "Running".

           An op is a fundamental operation that Perl can perform: all the built-
           in functions and operators are ops, and there are a series of ops which
           deal with concepts the interpreter needs internally - entering and
           leaving a block, ending a statement, fetching a variable, and so on.

    Let's start in the middle, at line 4. This is a BINOP, a binary
           operator, which is at location 0x8179828. The specific operator in
           question is "sassign" - scalar assignment - and you can find the code
           which implements it in the function "pp_sassign" in pp_hot.c. As a
           binary operator, it has two children: the add operator, providing the
           result of "$b+$c", is uppermost on line 5, and the left hand side is on
           line 10.

           Line 10 is the null op: this does exactly nothing. What is that doing
           there? If you see the null op, it's a sign that something has been
           optimized away after parsing. As we mentioned in "Optimization", the
           optimization stage sometimes converts two operations into one, for
           example when fetching a scalar variable. When this happens, instead of
           rewriting the op tree and cleaning up the dangling pointers, it's
           easier just to replace the redundant operation with the null op.
           Originally, the tree would have looked like this:

    Manpage text:

    The grammar, lines one and three of the snippet above, tells you how to
           build up more complex forms. These complex forms, "non-terminal
           symbols" are generally placed in lower case. "term" here is a non-
           terminal symbol, representing a single expression.

           The grammar gives you the following rule: you can make the thing on the
           left of the colon if you see all the things on the right in sequence.
           This is called a "reduction", and the aim of parsing is to completely
           reduce the input. There are several different ways you can perform a
           reduction, separated by vertical bars: so, "term" followed by "="
           followed by "term" makes a "term", and "term" followed by "+" followed
           by "term" can also make a "term".

           So, if you see two terms with an "=" or "+", between them, you can turn
           them into a single expression. When you do this, you execute the code
           in the block on the next line: if you see "=", you'll do the code in
           line 2. If you see "+", you'll do the code in line 4. It's this code

           Just set the integer value of the top stack entry to its negation.

           Argument stack manipulation in the core is exactly the same as it is in
           XSUBs - see perlxstut, perlxs and perlguts for a longer description of
           the macros used in stack manipulation.

       Mark stack
           I say "your portion of the stack" above because PP code doesn't
           necessarily get the whole stack to itself: if your function calls
           another function, you'll only want to expose the arguments aimed for
           the called function, and not (necessarily) let it get at your own data.
           The way we do this is to have a "virtual" bottom-of-stack, exposed to
           each function. The mark stack keeps bookmarks to locations in the
           argument stack usable by each function. For instance, when dealing with
           a tied variable, (internally, something with "P" magic) Perl has to
           call methods for accesses to the tied variables. However, we need to
           separate the arguments exposed to the method to the argument exposed to
           the original function - the store or fetch or whatever it may be.
           Here's roughly how the tied "push" is implemented; see "av_push" in
           av.c:

Think of them as the \"{\" and \"}\" of\n       a Perl block.\n\n       To actually do the magic method call, we have to call a subroutine in\n       Perl space: \"call_method\" takes care of that, and it's described in\n       perlcall. We call the \"PUSH\" method in scalar context, and we're going\n       to discard its return value.

Some have called the pervasive use of macros the hardest thing\n       to understand, others find it adds to clarity. Let's take an example, a\n       stripped-down version the code which implements the addition operator:\n\n\t  1  PP(pp_add)\n\t  2  {\n\t  3\t dSP; dATARGET;\n\t  4\t tryAMAGICbin_MG(add_amg, AMGf_assign|AMGf_numeric);\n\t  5\t {\n\t  6\t   dPOPTOPnnrl_ul;\n\t  7\t   SETn( left + right );\n\t  8\t   RETURN;\n\t  9\t }\n\t 10  }\n\n       Every line here (apart from the braces, of course) contains a macro.\n       The first line sets up the function declaration as Perl expects for PP\n       code; line 3 sets up variable declarations for the argument stack and\n       the target, the return value of the operation. Line 4 tries to see if\n       the addition operation is overloaded; if so, the appropriate subroutine\n       is called."

These are the two operands to the addition operator.  Next,\n       we call \"SETn\" to set the NV of the return value to the result of\n       adding the two values. This done, we return - the \"RETURN\" macro makes\n       sure that our return value is properly handled, and we pass the next\n       operator to run back to the main run loop.\n\n       Most of these macros are explained in perlapi, and some of the more\n       important ones are explained in perlxs as well.
