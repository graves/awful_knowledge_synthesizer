Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `iwidgets_finddialog`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The iwidgets::finddialog command creates a find dialog that works in\n       conjunction with a text or scrolledtext widget to provide a means of\n       performing search operations.  The user is prompted for a text pattern\n       to be found in the text or scrolledtext widget.\tThe search can be for\n       all occurances, by regular expression, considerate of the case, or\n       backwards.\n\n\nMETHODS\n       The iwidgets::finddialog command creates a new Tcl command whose name\n       is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various operations on\n       the widget.  It has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The\n       following commands are possible for finddialog widgets:\n\nINHERITED METHODS\n       add\t       buttonconfigure\t\t      defaulthide\n       invoke\t       show\n\n       See the \"buttonbox\" widget manual entry for details on the above\n       inherited methods.\n\n       activate        center\t      deactivate\n\n       See the \"shell\" widget manual entry for details on the above inherited\n       methods.\n\nWIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS\n       pathName cget option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::finddialog command.\n\n       pathName clear\n\t      Clears the pattern in the entry field and the pattern matchin\n\t      indicators in the text or scrolledtext widget.\n\n       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.\tIf no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list).\tIf option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t      given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty\n\t      string.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::finddialog command.\n\n       pathName find\n\t      Search for a specific text string in the text widget given by\n\t      the -textwidget option.  This method is the standard callback\n\t      for the Find button.  It is made available such that it can be\n\t      bound to a find again action."
