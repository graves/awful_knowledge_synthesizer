The main point of\n       this package is that the commands here provide a nicer callback API\n       than the builtin command fcopy, making the use of these facilities\n       simpler than the builtin.\n\nAPI\n       transfer::copy::do chan|string data outchannel ?options...?\n\t      This command transfers the information in data to the\n\t      outchannel, according to the options. The type of the\n\t      information in data is determined by the first argument.\n\n\t      The options available to this command are the same as are\n\t      available to the command transfer::copy::options, and explained\n\t      there.\n\n\t      chan   The argument data contains the handle of a channel and\n\t\t     the actual infomration to transfer is read from that\n\t\t     channel.\n\n\t      string The argument data contains a string and this is the\n\t\t     information to be transfered.\n\n       transfer::copy::chan channel outchannel ?options...?\n\t      This command is a shorter and more direct form for the command\n\t      transfer::copy::do chan.\n\n       transfer::copy::string string outchannel ?options...?\n\t      This command is a shorter and more direct form for the command\n\t      transfer::copy::do string.\n\n       transfer::copy::doChan channel outchannel optvar\n\t      This command is an alternate form of transfer::copy::chan which\n\t      reads its options out of the array variable named by optvar\n\t      instead of from a variable length argument list.\n\n       transfer::copy::doString string outchannel optvar\n\t      This command is an alternate form of transfer::copy::string\n\t      which reads its options out of the array variable named by\n\t      optvar instead of from a variable length argument list.\n\n       transfer::copy::options outchannel optionlist optvar\n\t      This command is the option processor used by all the commands\n\t      above which read their options from a variable length argument\n\t      list. It first reads default settings from the channel handle\n\t      outchannel, then processes the list of options in optionlist, at\n\t      last stores the results in the array variable named by optvar.\n\t      The contents of that variable are in a format which is directly\n\t      understood by all the commands above which read their options\n\t      out of an array variable.\n\n\t      The recognized options are:\n\n\t      -blocksize int\n\t\t     This option specifies the size of the chunks to transfer\n\t\t     in one operation. It is optional and defaults to the\n\t\t     value of -buffersize as configured for the output\n\t\t     channel.\n\n\t\t     If specified its value has to be an integer number\n\t\t     greater than zero.\n\n\t      -command commandprefix\n\t\t     This option specifies the completion callback of the\n\t\t     operation. This option has to be specified. An error will\n\t\t     be thrown if it is not, or if the empty list was\n\t\t     specified as argument to it.\n\n\t\t     Its value has to be a command prefix, i.e. a list whose\n\t\t     first word is the command to execute, followed by words\n\t\t     containing fixed arguments. When the callback is invoked\n\t\t     one or two additional arguments are appended to the\n\t\t     prefix. The first argument is the number of bytes which\n\t\t     were transfered. The optional second argument is an error\n\t\t     message and added if and only if an error occured during\n\t\t     the the transfer.\n\n\t      -progress commandprefix\n\t\t     This option specifies the progress callback of the\n\t\t     operation. It is optional and defaults to the empty list.\n\t\t     This last possibility signals that no feedback was asked\n\t\t     for and disabled it.\n\n\t\t     Its value has to be a command prefix, see above, -command\n\t\t     for a more detailed explanation. When the callback is\n\t\t     invoked a single additional arguments is appended to the\n\t\t     prefix. This argument is the number of bytes which were\n\t\t     transfered so far.\n\n\t      -size int\n\t\t     This option specifies the number of bytes to read from\n\t\t     the input data and transfer. It is optional and defaults\n\t\t     to \"Transfer everything\".\tIts value has to be an integer\n\t\t     number and any value less than zero has the same meaning,\n\t\t     i.e. to transfer all available data. Any other value is\n\t\t     the amount of bytes to transfer.\n\n\t\t     All transfer commands will throw error an when their user\n\t\t     tries to transfer more data than is available in the\n\t\t     input. This happens immediately, before the transfer is\n\t\t     actually started, should the input be a string. Otherwise\n\t\t     the, i.e. for a channel as input, the error is thrown the\n\t\t     moment the underflow condition is actually detected.\n\n\t      -encoding encodingname\n\n\t      -eofchar eofspec\n\n\t      -translation transspec\n\t\t     These options are the same as are recognized by the\n\t\t     builtin command fconfigure and provide the settings for\n\t\t     the output channel which are to be active during the\n\t\t     transfer, and only then. I.e. the settings of the output\n\t\t     channel before the transfer are saved, and restored at\n\t\t     the end of a transfer, regardless of its success or\n\t\t     failure. None of these options are required, and they\n\t\t     default to the settings of the output channel if not\n\t\t     specified.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
