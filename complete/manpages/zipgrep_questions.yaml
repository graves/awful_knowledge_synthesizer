Its output is identical to that of\n       egrep(1).\n\nARGUMENTS\n       pattern\n\t      The pattern to be located within a ZIP archive.  Any string or\n\t      regular expression accepted by egrep(1) may be used.  file[.zip]\n\t      Path of the ZIP archive.\t(Wildcard expressions for the ZIP\n\t      archive name are not supported.)\tIf the literal filename is not\n\t      found, the suffix .zip is appended.  Note that self-extracting\n\t      ZIP files are supported, as with any other ZIP archive; just\n\t      specify the .exe suffix (if any) explicitly.\n\n       [file(s)]\n\t      An optional list of archive members to be processed, separated\n\t      by spaces.  If no member files are specified, all members of the\n\t      ZIP archive are searched.  Regular expressions (wildcards) may\n\t      be used to match multiple members:"

  manpageQuestion2: How can you use zipgrep to search for lines containing the word 'error' in all files within a ZIP archive named 'data.zip'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using zipgrep with a regular expression to find all files in 'data.zip' that contain the pattern 'log4j'?

If an exclamation point or a\n\t\t     caret (`!' or `^') follows the left bracket, then the\n\t\t     range of characters within the brackets is complemented\n\t\t     (that is, anything except the characters inside the\n\t\t     brackets is considered a match).\n\n\t      (Be sure to quote any character that might otherwise be\n\t      interpreted or modified by the operating system.)\n\n       [-x xfile(s)]\n\t      An optional list of archive members to be excluded from\n\t      processing.  Since wildcard characters match directory\n\t      separators (`/'), this option may be used to exclude any files\n\t      that are in subdirectories.  For example, ``zipgrep grumpy foo\n\t      *.[ch] -x */*'' would search for the string ``grumpy'' in all C\n\t      source files in the main directory of the ``foo'' archive, but\n\t      none in any subdirectories.  Without the -x option, all C source\n\t      files in all directories within the zipfile would be searched."
