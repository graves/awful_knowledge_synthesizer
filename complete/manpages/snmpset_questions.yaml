One or more object identifiers (OIDs)\n       must be given as arguments on the command line.\tA type and a value to\n       be set must accompany each object identifier.  Each variable name is\n       given in the format specified in variables(5).\n\n       The TYPE is a single character, one of:\n\t      i  INTEGER\n\t      u  UNSIGNED\n\t      s  STRING\n\t      x  HEX STRING\n\t      d  DECIMAL STRING\n\t      n  NULLOBJ\n\t      o  OBJID\n\t      t  TIMETICKS\n\t      a  IPADDRESS\n\t      b  BITS\n       Most of these will use the obvious corresponding ASN.1 type.  's', 'x',\n       'd' and 'b' are all different ways of specifying an OCTET STRING value,\n       and the 'u' unsigned type is also used for handling Gauge32 values."

    Manpage text:

    If you have the proper MIB file loaded, you can, in most cases, replace
           the type with an '=' sign. For an object of type OCTET STRING this will
           assume a string like the 's' type notation. For other types it will do
           "The Right Thing".

           For example:

           snmpset -c private -v 1 test-hub system.sysContact.0 s
           dpz@noc.rutgers.edu ip.ipforwarding.0 = 2

           will set the variables sysContact.0 and ipForwarding.0:

           system.sysContact.0 = STRING: "dpz@noc.rutgers.edu"
           ip.ipForwarding.0 = INTEGER: not-forwarding(2)

           If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an
           error packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to
           pinpoint in what way the request was malformed.

    OPTIONS
           snmpset takes the common options described in the snmpcmd(1) manual
           page.  Note that snmpset REQUIRES  an argument specifying the agent to
           query and at least one set of OID/type/value arguments, as described in
           there.
