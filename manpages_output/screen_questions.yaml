There is a scrollback history buffer for\n       each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving\n       text regions between windows.\n\n       When screen is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it\n       (or the specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you\n       can use the program as you normally would.  Then, at any time, you can\n       create new (full-screen) windows with other programs in them (including\n       more shells), kill existing windows, view a list of windows, turn\n       output logging on and off, copy-and-paste text between windows, view\n       the scrollback history, switch between windows in whatever manner you\n       wish, etc. All windows run their programs completely independent of\n       each other. Programs continue to run when their window is currently not\n       visible and even when the whole screen session is detached from the\n       user's terminal.  When a program terminates, screen (per default) kills\n       the window that contained it.  If this window was in the foreground,\n       the display switches to the previous window; if none are left, screen\n       exits.\n\n       Everything you type is sent to the program running in the current\n       window.\tThe only exception to this is the one keystroke that is used\n       to initiate a command to the window manager.  By default, each command\n       begins with a control-a (abbreviated C-a from now on), and is followed\n       by one other keystroke.\tThe command character and all the key bindings\n       can be fully customized to be anything you like, though they are always\n       two characters in length.\n\n       Screen does not understand the prefix \"C-\" to mean control.  Please use\n       the caret notation (\"^A\" instead of \"C-a\") as arguments to e.g. the\n       escape command or the -e option.  Screen will also print out control\n       characters in caret notation.\n\n       The standard way to create a new window is to type \"C-a c\".  This\n       creates a new window running a shell and switches to that window\n       immediately, regardless of the state of the process running in the\n       current window.\tSimilarly, you can create a new window with a custom\n       command in it by first binding the command to a keystroke (in your\n       .screenrc file or at the \"C-a :\" command line) and then using it just\n       like the \"C-a c\" command.  In addition, new windows can be created by\n       running a command like:\n\n\t      screen emacs prog.c\n\n       from a shell prompt within a previously created window.\tThis will not\n       run another copy of screen, but will instead supply the command name\n       and its arguments to the window manager (specified in the $STY\n       environment variable) who will use it to create the new window.\tThe\n       above example would start the emacs editor (editing prog.c) and switch\n       to its window.\n\n       If \"/etc/utmp\" is writable by screen, an appropriate record will be\n       written to this file for each window, and removed when the window is\n       terminated.  This is useful for working with \"talk\", \"script\",\n       \"shutdown\", \"rsend\", \"sccs\" and other similar programs that use the\n       utmp file to determine who you are. As long as screen is active on your\n       terminal, the terminal's own record is removed from the utmp file. See\n       also \"C-a L\"."

    GETTING STARTED
           Before you begin to use screen you'll need to make sure you have
           correctly selected your terminal type, just as you would for any other
           termcap/terminfo program.  (You can do this by using tset for example.)

           If you're impatient and want to get started without doing a lot more
           reading, you should remember this one command:  "C-a ?".  Typing these
           two characters will display a list of the available screen commands and
           their bindings. Each keystroke is discussed in the section "DEFAULT KEY
           BINDINGS". The manual section "CUSTOMIZATION" deals with the contents
           of your .screenrc.

           If your terminal is a "true" auto-margin terminal (it doesn't allow the
           last position on the screen to be updated without scrolling the screen)
           consider using a version of your terminal's termcap that has automatic
           margins turned off. This will ensure an accurate and optimal update of
           the screen in all circumstances. Most terminals nowadays have "magic"
           margins (automatic margins plus usable last column). This is the VT100
           style type and perfectly suited for screen.  If all you've got is a
           "true" auto-margin terminal screen will be content to use it, but
           updating a character put into the last position on the screen may not
           be possible until the screen scrolls or the character is moved into a
           safe position in some other way. This delay can be shortened by using a
           terminal with insert-character capability.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `screen`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nCOMMAND-LINE OPTIONS\n       Screen has the following command-line options:\n\n       -a   include all capabilities (with some minor exceptions) in each\n\t    window's termcap, even if screen must redraw parts of the display\n\t    in order to implement a function.\n\n       -A   Adapt the sizes of all windows to the size of the current\n\t    terminal.  By default, screen tries to restore its old window\n\t    sizes when attaching to resizable terminals (those with \"WS\" in\n\t    its description, e.g. suncmd or some xterm).\n\n       -c file\n\t    override the default configuration file from \"$HOME/.screenrc\" to\n\t    file.\n\n       -d|-D [pid.tty.host]\n\t    does not start screen, but detaches the elsewhere running screen\n\t    session. It has the same effect as typing \"C-a d\" from screen's\n\t    controlling terminal. -D is the equivalent to the power detach\n\t    key.  If no session can be detached, this option is ignored. In\n\t    combination with the -r/-R option more powerful effects can be\n\t    achieved:\n\n       -d -r   Reattach a session and if necessary detach it first.\n\n       -d -R   Reattach a session and if necessary detach or even create it\n\t       first.\n\n       -d -RR  Reattach a session and if necessary detach or create it. Use\n\t       the first session if more than one session is available.\n\n       -D -r   Reattach a session. If necessary detach and logout remotely\n\t       first.\n\n       -D -R   Attach here and now. In detail this means: If a session is\n\t       running, then reattach. If necessary detach and logout remotely\n\t       first.  If it was not running create it and notify the user.\n\t       This is the author's favorite.\n\n       -D -RR  Attach here and now. Whatever that means, just do it.\n\n\n\t    Note: It is always a good idea to check the status of your\n\t    sessions by means of \"screen -list\".\n\n       -e xy\n\t    specifies the command character to be x and the character\n\t    generating a literal command character to y (when typed after the\n\t    command character).  The default is \"C-a\" and `a', which can be\n\t    specified as \"-e^Aa\".  When creating a screen session, this option\n\t    sets the default command character. In a multiuser session all\n\t    users added will start off with this command character. But when\n\t    attaching to an already running session, this option changes only\n\t    the command character of the attaching user.  This option is\n\t    equivalent to either the commands \"defescape\" or \"escape\"\n\t    respectively.\n\n       -f, -fn, and -fa\n\t    turns flow-control on, off, or \"automatic switching mode\".\tThis\n\t    can also be defined through the \"defflow\" .screenrc command.\n\n       -h num\n\t    Specifies the history scrollback buffer to be num lines high.\n\n       -i   will cause the interrupt key (usually C-c) to interrupt the\n\t    display immediately when flow-control is on.  See the \"defflow\"\n\t    .screenrc command for details.  The use of this option is\n\t    discouraged.\n\n       -l and -ln\n\t    turns login mode on or off (for /etc/utmp updating).  This can\n\t    also be defined through the \"deflogin\" .screenrc command.\n\n       -ls and -list\n\t    does not start screen, but prints a list of pid.tty.host strings\n\t    identifying your screen sessions.  Sessions marked `detached' can\n\t    be resumed with \"screen -r\". Those marked `attached' are running\n\t    and have a controlling terminal. If the session runs in multiuser\n\t    mode, it is marked `multi'. Sessions marked as `unreachable'\n\t    either live on a different host or are `dead'.  An unreachable\n\t    session is considered dead, when its name matches either the name\n\t    of the local host, or the specified parameter, if any.  See the -r\n\t    flag for a description how to construct matches.  Sessions marked\n\t    as `dead' should be thoroughly checked and removed.  Ask your\n\t    system administrator if you are not sure. Remove sessions with the\n\t    -wipe option.\n\n       -L   tells screen to turn on automatic output logging for the windows.\n\n       -m   causes screen to ignore the $STY environment variable. With\n\t    \"screen -m\" creation of a new session is enforced, regardless\n\t    whether screen is called from within another screen session or\n\t    not. This flag has a special meaning in connection with the `-d'\n\t    option:\n\n       -d -m   Start screen in \"detached\" mode. This creates a new session but\n\t       doesn't attach to it. This is useful for system startup\n\t       scripts.\n\n       -D -m   This also starts screen in \"detached\" mode, but doesn't fork a\n\t       new process. The command exits if the session terminates.\n\n       -O   selects a more optimal output mode for your terminal rather than\n\t    true VT100 emulation (only affects auto-margin terminals without\n\t    `LP').  This can also be set in your .screenrc by specifying `OP'\n\t    in a \"termcap\" command.\n\n       -p number_or_name\n\t    Preselect a window. This is usefull when you want to reattach to a\n\t    specific windor or you want to send a command via the \"-X\" option\n\t    to a specific window. As with screen's select commant, \"-\" selects\n\t    the blank window. As a special case for reattach, \"=\" brings up\n\t    the windowlist on the blank window.\n\n       -q   Suppress printing of error messages. In combination with \"-ls\" the\n\t    exit value is as follows: 9 indicates a directory without\n\t    sessions. 10 indicates a directory with running but not attachable\n\t    sessions. 11 (or more) indicates 1 (or more) usable sessions.  In\n\t    combination with \"-r\" the exit value is as follows: 10 indicates\n\t    that there is no session to resume. 12 (or more) indicates that\n\t    there are 2 (or more) sessions to resume and you should specify\n\t    which one to choose.  In all other cases \"-q\" has no effect.\n\n       -r [pid.tty.host]\n       -r sessionowner/[pid.tty.host]\n\t    resumes a detached screen session.\tNo other options (except\n\t    combinations with -d/-D) may be specified, though an optional\n\t    prefix of [pid.]tty.host may be needed to distinguish between\n\t    multiple detached screen sessions.\tThe second form is used to\n\t    connect to another user's screen session which runs in multiuser\n\t    mode. This indicates that screen should look for sessions in\n\t    another user's directory. This requires setuid-root.\n\n       -R   attempts to resume the first detached screen session it finds.  If\n\t    successful, all other command-line options are ignored.  If no\n\t    detached session exists, starts a new session using the specified\n\t    options, just as if -R had not been specified. The option is set\n\t    by default if screen is run as a login-shell (actually screen uses\n\t    \"-xRR\" in that case).  For combinations with the -d/-D option see\n\t    there.\n\n       -s   sets the default shell to the program specified, instead of the\n\t    value in the environment variable $SHELL (or \"/bin/sh\" if not\n\t    defined).  This can also be defined through the \"shell\" .screenrc\n\t    command.\n\n       -S sessionname\n\t    When creating a new session, this option can be used to specify a\n\t    meaningful name for the session. This name identifies the session\n\t    for \"screen -list\" and \"screen -r\" actions. It substitutes the\n\t    default [tty.host] suffix.\n\n       -t name\n\t    sets the title (a.k.a.) for the default shell or specified\n\t    program.  See also the \"shelltitle\" .screenrc command.\n\n       -U   Run screen in UTF-8 mode. This option tells screen that your\n\t    terminal sends and understands UTF-8 encoded characters. It also\n\t    sets the default encoding for new windows to `utf8'.\n\n       -v   Print version number.\n\n       -wipe [match]\n\t    does the same as \"screen -ls\", but removes destroyed sessions\n\t    instead of marking them as `dead'.\tAn unreachable session is\n\t    considered dead, when its name matches either the name of the\n\t    local host, or the explicitly given parameter, if any.  See the -r\n\t    flag for a description how to construct matches.\n\n       -x   Attach to a not detached screen session. (Multi display mode).\n\n       -X   Send the specified command to a running screen session. You can\n\t    use the -d or -r option to tell screen to look only for attached\n\t    or detached screen sessions. Note that this command doesn't work\n\t    if the session is password protected."

    CUSTOMIZATION
           The "socket directory" defaults either to $HOME/.screen or simply to
           /tmp/screens or preferably to /usr/local/screens chosen at compile-
           time. If screen is installed setuid-root, then the administrator should
           compile screen with an adequate (not NFS mounted) socket directory. If
           screen is not running setuid-root, the user can specify any mode 700
           directory in the environment variable $SCREENDIR.

           When screen is invoked, it executes initialization commands from the
           files "/usr/local/etc/screenrc" and ".screenrc" in the user's home

    acldel username

           Remove a user from screen's access control list. If currently attached,
           all the user's displays are detached from the session. He cannot attach
           again.  Multi user mode only.

           aclgrp username [groupname]

           Creates groups of users that share common access rights. The name of
           the group is the username of the group leader. Each member of the group
           inherits the permissions that are granted to the group leader. That
           means, if a user fails an access check, another check is made for the
           group leader.  A user is removed from all groups the special value
           "none" is used for groupname.  If the second parameter is omitted all

           aclumask [[users]+bits |[users]-bits .... ]
           umask [[users]+bits |[users]-bits .... ]

           This specifies the access other users have to windows that will be

           separated list of known usernames. If no users are specified, a list of

           will be granted to any window initially.  The special username "??"

    altscreen on|off

           If set to on, "alternate screen" support is enabled in virtual
           terminals, just like in xterm.  Initial setting is `off'.

           at [identifier][#|*|%]  command [args ... ]

           Execute a command at other displays or windows as if it had been
           entered there.  "At" changes the context (the `current window' or
           `current display' setting) of the command. If the first parameter
           describes a non-unique context, the command will be executed multiple
           times. If the first parameter is of the form `identifier*' then
           identifier is matched against user names.  The command is executed once
           for each display of the selected user(s). If the first parameter is of
           the form `identifier%' identifier is matched against displays. Displays
           are named after the ttys they attach. The prefix `/dev/' or `/dev/tty'
           may be omitted from the identifier.  If identifier has a `#' or nothing
           appended it is matched against window numbers and titles. Omitting an
           identifier in front of the `#', `*' or `%'-character selects all users,
           displays or windows because a prefix-match is performed. Note that on
           the affected display(s) a short message will describe what happened.
           Permission is checked for initiator of the "at" command, not for the
           owners of the affected display(s).  Note that the '#' character works
           as a comment introducer when it is preceded by whitespace. This can be
           escaped by prefixing a '\'.  Permission is checked for the initiator of
           the "at" command, not for the owners of the affected display(s).
           Caveat: When matching against windows, the command is executed at least
           once per window. Commands that change the internal arrangement of
           windows (like "other") may be called again. In shared windows the
           command will be repeated for each attached display. Beware, when
           issuing toggle commands like "login"!  Some commands (e.g. "process")
           require that a display is associated with the target windows.  These
           commands may not work correctly under "at" looping over windows.

           is killed with the first keypress, the read key is discarded.
           This command is normally used together with the "idle" command.

           Defines a blanker program. Disables the blanker program if no arguments
           are given.

    You can mix both forms by providing a string as an additional argument.

           charset set

           Change the current character set slot designation and charset mapping.
           The first four character of set are treated as charset designators
           while the fifth and sixth character must be in range '0' to '3' and set
           the GL/GR charset mapping. On every position a '.' may be used to
           indicate that the corresponding charset/mapping should not be changed
           (set is padded to six characters internally by appending '.' chars).
           New windows have "BBBB02" as default charset, unless a "encoding"
           command is active.
           The current setting can be viewed with the "info" command.

           chdir [directory]

           Change the current directory of screen to the specified directory or,
           if called without an argument, to your home directory (the value of the
           environment variable $HOME).  All windows that are created by means of
           the "screen" command from within ".screenrc" or by means of "C-a :
           screen ..." or "C-a c" use this as their default directory.  Without a
           chdir command, this would be the directory from which screen was
           invoked.  Hardcopy and log files are always written to the window's
           default directory, not the current directory of the process running in
           the window.  You can use this command multiple times in your .screenrc
           to start various windows in different default directories, but the last
           chdir value will affect all the windows you create interactively.

    clear

           Clears the current window and saves its image to the scrollback buffer.

           colon [prefix]

           Allows you to enter ".screenrc" command lines. Useful for on-the-fly
           modification of key bindings, specific window creation and changing
           settings. Note that the "set" keyword no longer exists! Usually
           commands affect the current window rather than default settings for
           future windows. Change defaults with commands starting with 'def...'.

           If you consider this as the `Ex command mode' of screen, you may regard
           "C-a esc" (copy mode) as its `Vi command mode'.

           command [-c class]

           This command has the same effect as typing the screen escape character
           (^A). It is probably only useful for key bindings.  If the "-c" option
           is given, select the specified command class.  See also "bind" and
           "bindkey".

    copy_reg [key]

           No longer exists, use "readreg" instead.

           crlf [on|off]

           This affects the copying of text regions with the `C-a [' command. If
           it is set to `on', lines will be separated by the two character
           sequence `CR' - `LF'.  Otherwise (default) only `LF' is used.  When no
           parameter is given, the state is toggled.

           Turns runtime debugging on or off. If screen has been compiled with
           option -DDEBUG debugging available and is turned on per default. Note
           that this command only affects debugging output from the main "SCREEN"

           The third, TCSBRK, blocks the complete screen session for the duration

           Tcsendbreak and TIOCSBRK may or may not produce long breaks with spikes
           (e.g. 4 per second). This is not only system dependant, this also

           digraph [preset]

           This command prompts the user for a digraph sequence. The next two

The default is \"^Aa\".\n\n       eval command1 [command2 ...]\n\n       Parses and executes each argument as separate command.\n\n       exec [[fdpat] newcommand [args ...]]\n\n       Run a unix subprocess (specified by an executable path newcommand and\n       its optional arguments) in the current window. The flow of data between\n       newcommands stdin/stdout/stderr, the process originally started in the\n       window (let us call it \"application-process\") and screen itself\n       (window) is controlled by the filedescriptor pattern fdpat.  This\n       pattern is basically a three character sequence representing stdin,\n       stdout and stderr of newcommand. A dot (.) connects the file descriptor\n       to screen.  An exclamation mark (!) causes the file descriptor to be\n       connected to the application-process. A colon (:) combines both.  User\n       input will go to newcommand unless newcommand receives the application-\n       process' output (fdpats first character is `!' or `:') or a pipe symbol\n       (|) is added (as a fourth character) to the end of fdpat.\n       Invoking `exec' without arguments shows name and arguments of the\n       currently running subprocess in this window. Only one subprocess a time\n       can be running in each window.\n       When a subprocess is running the `kill' command will affect it instead\n       of the windows process.\n       Refer to the postscript file `doc/fdpat.ps' for a confusing\n       illustration of all 21 possible combinations. Each drawing shows the\n       digits 2,1,0 representing the three file descriptors of newcommand. The\n       box marked `W' is the usual pty that has the application-process on its\n       replica side.  The box marked `P' is the secondary pty that now has\n       screen at its primary side."

    gr [on|off]

           Turn GR charset switching on/off. Whenever screen sees an input
           character with the 8th bit set, it will use the charset stored in the
           GR slot and print the character with the 8th bit stripped. The default
           (see also "defgr") is not to process GR switching because otherwise the
           ISO88591 charset would not work.

           hardcopy [-h] [file]

           Writes out the currently displayed image to the file file, or, if no
           filename is specified, to hardcopy.n in the default directory, where n
           is the number of the current window.  This either appends or overwrites
           the file if it exists. See below.  If the option -h is specified, dump
           also the contents of the scrollback buffer.

           hardcopy_append on|off

           If set to "on", screen will append to the "hardcopy.n" files created by
           the command "C-a h", otherwise these files are overwritten each time.
           Default is `off'.

           hardcopydir directory

           Defines a directory where hardcopy files will be placed. If unset,

    history

           Usually users work with a shell that allows easy access to previous
           commands.  For example csh has the command "!!" to repeat the last
           command executed.  Screen allows you to have a primitive way of re-
           calling "the command that started ...": You just type the first letter
           of that command, then hit `C-a {' and screen tries to find a previous
           line that matches with the `prompt character' to the left of the
           cursor. This line is pasted into this window's input queue.  Thus you
           have a crude command history (made up by the visible window and its
           scrollback buffer).

           hstatus status

           Change the window's hardstatus line to the string status.

           idle [timeout [cmd args]]

           Sets a command that is run after the specified number of seconds
           inactivity is reached. This command will normally be the "blanker"
           command to create a screen blanker, but it can be any screen command.
           If no command is specified, only the timeout is set. A timeout of zero

           This command controls logfile time-stamp mechanism of screen.  If time-
           stamps are turned "on", screen adds a string containing the current
           time to the logfile after two minutes of inactivity.  When output
           continues and more than another two minutes have passed, a second time-
           stamp is added to document the restart of the output. You can change
           this timeout with the second form of the command. The third form is
           used for customizing the time-stamp string (`-- %n:%t -- time-stamp --
           %M/%d/%y %c:%s --\n' by default).

    nethack on|off

           Changes the kind of error messages used by screen.  When you are
           familiar with the game "nethack", you may enjoy the nethack-style
           messages which will often blur the facts a little, but are much funnier
           to read. Anyway, standard messages often tend to be unclear as well.
           This option is only available if screen was compiled with the NETHACK
           flag defined. The default setting is then determined by the presence of
           the environment variable $NETHACKOPTIONS.

           next

           Switch to the next window.  This command can be used repeatedly to
           cycle through the list of windows.

           nonblock [on|off|numsecs]

           Tell screen how to deal with user interfaces (displays) that cease to
           accept output. This can happen if a user presses ^S or a TCP/modem
           connection gets cut but no hangup is received. If nonblock is off (this
           is the default) screen waits until the display restarts to accept the
           output. If nonblock is on, screen waits until the timeout is reached
           (on is treated as 1s). If the display still doesn't receive characters,
           screen will consider it "blocked" and stop sending characters to it. If
           at some time it restarts to accept characters, screen will unblock the
           display and redisplay the updated window contents.

The register '.' is treated as the\n       paste buffer. If no parameter is given the user is prompted for a\n       single register to paste.  The paste buffer can be filled with the\n       copy, history and readbuf commands.  Other registers can be filled with\n       the register, readreg and paste commands.  If paste is called with a\n       second argument, the contents of the specified registers is pasted into\n       the named destination register rather than the window.

When the source\n       specification only contains registers (not the paste buffer) then there\n       need not be a current display (terminal attached), as the registers are\n       a global resource.

This can be a prefix of a\n       window title (alphanumeric window name) or a window number.  The\n       parameter is optional and if omitted, you get prompted for an\n       identifier.  When a new window is established, the first available\n       number is assigned to this window.  Thus, the first window can be\n       activated by \"select 0\".  The number of windows is limited at compile-\n       time by the MAXWIN configuration parameter.  There are two special\n       WindowIDs, \"-\" selects the internal blank window and \".\" selects the\n       current window. The latter is useful if used with screen's \"-X\" option.\n\n       sessionname [name]\n\n       Rename the current session. Note, that for \"screen -list\" the name\n       shows up with the process-id prepended. If the argument \"name\" is\n       omitted, the name of this session is displayed. Caution: The $STY\n       environment variables still reflects the old name. This may result in\n       confusion.  The default is constructed from the tty and host names.\n\n       setenv  [var [string]]\n\n       Set the environment variable var to value string.  If only var is\n       specified, the user will be prompted to enter a value.  If no\n       parameters are specified, the user will be prompted for both variable\n       and value. The environment is inherited by all subsequently forked\n       shells.\n\n       setsid [on|off]\n\n       Normally screen uses different sessions and process groups for the\n       windows. If setsid is turned off, this is not done anymore and all\n       windows will be in the same process group as the screen backend\n       process. This also breaks job-control, so be careful.  The default is\n       on, of course. This command is probably useful only in rare\n       circumstances.\n\n       shell command\n\n       Set the command to be used to create a new shell.  This overrides the\n       value of the environment variable $SHELL.  This is useful if you'd like\n       to run a tty-enhancer which is expecting to execute the program\n       specified in $SHELL. If the command begins with a '-' character, the\n       shell will be started as a login-shell.\n\n       shelltitle title\n\n       Set the title for all shells created during startup or by the C-A C-c\n       command.  For details about what a title is, see the discussion\n       entitled \"TITLES (naming windows)\".\n\n       silence [on|off|sec]\n\n       Toggles silence monitoring of windows.  When silence is turned on and\n       an affected window is switched into the background, you will receive\n       the silence notification message in the status line after a specified\n       period of inactivity (silence).

Silence is initially off for all windows.\n\n       silencewait sec\n\n       Define the time that all windows monitored for silence should wait\n       before displaying a message. Default 30 seconds.\n\n       sleep num\n\n       This command will pause the execution of a .screenrc file for num\n       seconds.  Keyboard activity will end the sleep.\tIt may be used to give\n       users a chance to read the messages output by \"echo\".\n\n       slowpaste msec\n\n       Define the speed at which text is inserted into the current window by\n       the paste (\"C-a ]\") command.  If the slowpaste value is nonzero text is\n       written character by character.\tscreen will make a pause of msec\n       milliseconds after each single character write to allow the application\n       to process its input. Only use slowpaste if your underlying system\n       exposes flow control problems while pasting large amounts of text.\n\n       source file\n\n       Read and execute commands from file file. Source commands may be nested\n       to a maximum recursion level of ten. If file is not an absolute path\n       and screen is already processing a source command, the parent directory\n       of the running source command file is used to search for the new\n       command file before screen's current directory.\n\n       Note that termcap/terminfo/termcapinfo commands only work at startup\n       and reattach time, so they must be reached via the default screenrc\n       files to have an effect.\n\n       sorendition [attr [color]]\n\n       Change the way screen does highlighting for text marking and printing\n       messages.  See the \"STRING ESCAPES\" chapter for the syntax of the\n       modifiers.  The default is currently \"=s dd\" (standout, default\n       colors).\n\n       split\n\n       Split the current region into two new ones. All regions on the display\n       are resized to make room for the new region. The blank window is\n       displayed on the new region. Use the \"remove\" or the \"only\" command to\n       delete regions.\n\n       startup_message on|off\n\n       Select whether you want to see the copyright notice during startup.\n       Default is `on', as you probably noticed.\n\n       stuff string\n\n       Stuff the string string in the input buffer of the current window.\n       This is like the \"paste\" command but with much less overhead.  You\n       cannot paste large buffers with the \"stuff\" command. It is most useful\n       for key bindings. See also \"bindkey\".\n\n       su [username [password [password2]]\n\n       Substitute the user of a display. The command prompts for all\n       parameters that are omitted. If passwords are specified as parameters,\n       they have to be specified un-crypted. The first password is matched\n       against the systems passwd database, the second password is matched\n       against the screen password as set with the commands \"acladd\" or\n       \"password\".  \"Su\" may be useful for the screen administrator to test\n       multiuser setups.  When the identification fails, the user has access\n       to the commands available for user nobody.  These are \"detach\",\n       \"license\", \"version\", \"help\" and \"displays\".\n\n       suspend\n\n       Suspend screen.\tThe windows are in the `detached' state, while screen\n       is suspended. This feature relies on the shell being able to do job\n       control.\n\n       term term\n\n       In each window's environment screen opens, the $TERM variable is set to\n       \"screen\" by default.  But when no description for \"screen\" is installed\n       in the local termcap or terminfo data base, you set $TERM to - say -\n       \"vt100\". This won't do much harm, as screen is VT100/ANSI compatible.\n       The use of the \"term\" command is discouraged for non-default purpose.\n       That is, one may want to specify special $TERM settings (e.g. vt100)\n       for the next \"screen rlogin othermachine\" command. Use the command\n       \"screen -T vt100 rlogin othermachine\" rather than setting and resetting\n       the default.\n\n       termcap term terminal-tweaks [window-tweaks]\n       terminfo term terminal-tweaks [window-tweaks]\n       termcapinfo term terminal-tweaks [window-tweaks]\n\n       Use this command to modify your terminal's termcap entry without going\n       through all the hassles involved in creating a custom termcap entry.\n       Plus, you can optionally customize the termcap generated for the\n       windows.  You have to place these commands in one of the screenrc\n       startup files, as they are meaningless once the terminal emulator is\n       booted.\n       If your system works uses the terminfo database rather than termcap,\n       screen will understand the `terminfo' command, which has the same\n       effects as the `termcap' command.  Two separate commands are provided,\n       as there are subtle syntactic differences, e.g. when parameter\n       interpolation (using `%') is required. Note that termcap names of the\n       capabilities have to be used with the `terminfo' command.\n       In many cases, where the arguments are valid in both terminfo and\n       termcap syntax, you can use the command `termcapinfo', which is just a\n       shorthand for a pair of `termcap' and `terminfo' commands with\n       identical arguments.\n\n       The first argument specifies which terminal(s) should be affected by\n       this definition.  You can specify multiple terminal names by separating\n       them with `|'s.\tUse `*' to match all terminals and `vt*' to match all\n       terminals that begin with \"vt\".\n\n       Each tweak argument contains one or more termcap defines (separated by\n       `:'s) to be inserted at the start of the appropriate termcap entry,\n       enhancing it or overriding existing values.  The first tweak modifies\n       your terminal's termcap, and contains definitions that your terminal\n       uses to perform certain functions.  Specify a null string to leave this\n       unchanged (e.g. '').  The second (optional) tweak modifies all the\n       window termcaps, and should contain definitions that screen understands\n       (see the \"VIRTUAL TERMINAL\" section).\n\n       Some examples:\n\n\t      termcap xterm*  LP:hs@\n\n       Informs screen that all terminals that begin with `xterm' have firm\n       auto-margins that allow the last position on the screen to be updated\n       (LP), but they don't really have a status line (no 'hs' - append `@' to\n       turn entries off).  Note that we assume `LP' for all terminal names\n       that start with \"vt\", but only if you don't specify a termcap command\n       for that terminal.\n\n\t      termcap vt*  LP\n\t      termcap vt102|vt220  Z0=\\E[?3h:Z1=\\E[?3l\n\n       Specifies the firm-margined `LP' capability for all terminals that\n       begin with `vt', and the second line will also add the escape-sequences\n       to switch into (Z0) and back out of (Z1) 132-character-per-line mode if\n       this is a VT102 or VT220.  (You must specify Z0 and Z1 in your termcap\n       to use the width-changing commands.)\n\n\t      termcap vt100  \"\"  l0=PF1:l1=PF2:l2=PF3:l3=PF4\n\n       This leaves your vt100 termcap alone and adds the function key labels\n       to each window's termcap entry.\n\n\t      termcap h19|z19  am@:im=\\E@:ei=\\EO  dc=\\E[P\n\n       Takes a h19 or z19 termcap and turns off auto-margins (am@) and enables\n       the insert mode (im) and end-insert (ei) capabilities (the `@' in the\n       `im' string is after the `=', so it is part of the string).  Having the\n       `im' and `ei' definitions put into your terminal's termcap will cause\n       screen to automatically advertise the character-insert capability in\n       each window's termcap.  Each window will also get the delete-character\n       capability (dc) added to its termcap, which screen will translate into\n       a line-update for the terminal (we're pretending it doesn't support\n       character deletion).\n\n       If you would like to fully specify each window's termcap entry, you\n       should instead set the $SCREENCAP variable prior to running screen.\n       See the discussion on the \"VIRTUAL TERMINAL\" in this manual, and the\n       termcap(5) man page for more information on termcap definitions.\n\n       time [string]\n\n       Uses the message line to display the time of day, the host name, and\n       the load averages over 1, 5, and 15 minutes (if this is available on\n       your system).  For window specific information use \"info\".\n\n       If a string is specified, it changes the format of the time report like\n       it is described in the \"STRING ESCAPES\" chapter. Screen uses a default\n       of \"%c:%s %M %d %H%? %l%?\".\n\n       title [windowtitle]\n\n       Set the name of the current window to windowtitle. If no name is\n       specified, screen prompts for one. This command was known as `aka' in\n       previous releases.\n\n       unsetenv var\n\n       Unset an environment variable.\n\n       utf8 [on|off [on|off]]\n\n       Change the encoding used in the current window. If utf8 is enabled, the\n       strings sent to the window will be UTF-8 encoded and vice versa.\n       Omitting the parameter toggles the setting. If a second parameter is\n       given, the display's encoding is also changed (this should rather be\n       done with screen's \"-U\" option).  See also \"defutf8\", which changes the\n       default setting of a new window.\n\n       vbell [on|off]\n\n       Sets the visual bell setting for this window. Omitting the parameter\n       toggles the setting. If vbell is switched on, but your terminal does\n       not support a visual bell, a `vbell-message' is displayed in the status\n       line when the bell character (^G) is received.  Visual bell support of\n       a terminal is defined by the termcap variable `vb' (terminfo: 'flash').\n       Per default, vbell is off, thus the audible bell is used.  See also\n       `bell_msg'.\n\n       vbell_msg [message]\n\n       Sets the visual bell message. message is printed to the status line if\n       the window receives a bell character (^G), vbell is set to \"on\", but\n       the terminal does not support a visual bell.  The default message is\n       \"Wuff, Wuff!!\".\tWithout parameter, the current message is shown.\n\n       vbellwait sec\n\n       Define a delay in seconds after each display of screen's visual bell\n       message. The default is 1 second.\n\n       verbose [on|off]\n\n       If verbose is switched on, the command name is echoed, whenever a\n       window is created (or resurrected from zombie state). Default is off.\n       Without parameter, the current setting is shown.\n\n       version\n\n       Print the current version and the compile date in the status line.\n\n       wall message\n\n       Write a message to all displays. The message will appear in the\n       terminal's status line.\n\n       width [-w|-d] [cols [lines]]\n\n       Toggle the window width between 80 and 132 columns or set it to cols\n       columns if an argument is specified.  This requires a capable terminal\n       and the termcap entries \"Z0\" and \"Z1\".  See the \"termcap\" command for\n       more information. You can also specify a new height if you want to\n       change both values.  The -w option tells screen to leave the display\n       size unchanged and just set the window size, -d vice versa.\n\n       windowlist [-b] [-m]\n       windowlist string [string]\n       windowlist title [title]\n\n       Display all windows in a table for visual window selection. The desired\n       window can be selected via the standard movement keys (see the \"copy\"\n       command) and activated via the return key.  If the -b option is given,\n       screen will switch to the blank window before presenting the list, so\n       that the current window is also selectable.  The -m option changes the\n       order of the windows, instead of sorting by window numbers screen uses\n       its internal most-recently-used list.\n\n       The table format can be changed with the string and title option, the\n       title is displayed as table heading, while the lines are made by using\n       the string setting. The default setting is \"Num Name%=Flags\" for the\n       title and \"%3n %t%=%f\" for the lines.  See the \"STRING ESCAPES\" chapter\n       for more codes (e.g. color settings).\n\n       windows\n\n       Uses the message line to display a list of all the windows.  Each\n       window is listed by number with the name of process that has been\n       started in the window (or its title); the current window is marked with\n       a `*'; the previous window is marked with a `-'; all the windows that\n       are \"logged in\" are marked with a `$'; a background window that has\n       received a bell is marked with a `!'; a background window that is being\n       monitored and has had activity occur is marked with an `@'; a window\n       which has output logging turned on is marked with `(L)'; windows\n       occupied by other users are marked with `&'; windows in the zombie\n       state are marked with `Z'.  If this list is too long to fit on the\n       terminal's status line only the portion around the current window is\n       displayed.\n\n       wrap [on|off]\n\n       Sets the line-wrap setting for the current window.  When line-wrap is\n       on, the second consecutive printable character output at the last\n       column of a line will wrap to the start of the following line.  As an\n       added feature, backspace (^H) will also wrap through the left margin to\n       the previous line.  Default is `on'.\n\n       writebuf [-e encoding] [filename]\n\n       Writes the contents of the paste buffer to the specified file, or the\n       public accessible screen-exchange file if no filename is given. This is\n       thought of as a primitive means of communication between screen users\n       on the same host. If an encoding is specified the paste buffer is\n       recoded on the fly to match the encoding.  The filename can be set with\n       the bufferfile command and defaults to \"/tmp/screen-exchange\".\n\n       writelock [on|off|auto]\n\n       In addition to access control lists, not all users may be able to write\n       to the same window at once. Per default, writelock is in `auto' mode\n       and grants exclusive input permission to the user who is the first to\n       switch to the particular window. When he leaves the window, other users\n       may obtain the writelock (automatically). The writelock of the current\n       window is disabled by the command \"writelock off\". If the user issues\n       the command \"writelock on\" he keeps the exclusive write permission\n       while switching to other windows.\n\n       xoff\n       xon\n\n       Insert a CTRL-s / CTRL-q character to the stdin queue of the current\n       window.\n\n       zmodem [off|auto|catch|pass]\n       zmodem sendcmd [string]\n       zmodem recvcmd [string]\n\n       Define zmodem support for screen. Screen understands two different\n       modes when it detects a zmodem request: \"pass\" and \"catch\".  If the\n       mode is set to \"pass\", screen will relay all data to the attacher until\n       the end of the transmission is reached.\tIn \"catch\" mode screen acts as\n       a zmodem endpoint and starts the corresponding rz/sz commands. If the\n       mode is set to \"auto\", screen will use \"catch\" if the window is a tty\n       (e.g. a serial line), otherwise it will use \"pass\".\n       You can define the templates screen uses in \"catch\" mode via the second\n       and the third form.\n       Note also that this is an experimental feature.\n\n       zombie [keys]\n       defzombie [keys]\n\n       Per default screen windows are removed from the window list as soon as\n       the windows process (e.g. shell) exits. When a string of two keys is\n       specified to the zombie command, `dead' windows will remain in the\n       list.  The kill command may be used to remove such a window. Pressing\n       the first key in the dead window has the same effect. When pressing the\n       second key, screen will attempt to resurrect the window. The process\n       that was initially running in the window will be launched again.\n       Calling zombie without parameters will clear the zombie setting, thus\n       making windows disappear when their process exits.\n\n       As the zombie-setting is manipulated globally for all windows, this\n       command should only be called defzombie. Until we need this as a per\n       window setting, the commands zombie and defzombie are synonymous."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `screen`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nTHE MESSAGE LINE\n       Screen displays informational messages and other diagnostics in a\n       message line.  While this line is distributed to appear at the bottom\n       of the screen, it can be defined to appear at the top of the screen\n       during compilation.  If your terminal has a status line defined in its\n       termcap, screen will use this for displaying its messages, otherwise a\n       line of the current screen will be temporarily overwritten and output\n       will be momentarily interrupted. The message line is automatically\n       removed after a few seconds delay, but it can also be removed early (on\n       terminals without a status line) by beginning to type.\n\n       The message line facility can be used by an application running in the\n       current window by means of the ANSI Privacy message control sequence.\n       For instance, from within the shell, try something like:\n\n\t      echo '<esc>^Hello world from window '$WINDOW'<esc>\\\\'\n\n       where '<esc>' is an escape, '^' is a literal up-arrow, and '\\\\' turns\n       into a single backslash.\n\n\nWINDOW TYPES\n       Screen provides three different window types. New windows are created\n       with screen's screen command (see also the entry in chapter\n       \"CUSTOMIZATION\"). The first parameter to the screen command defines\n       which type of window is created. The different window types are all\n       special cases of the normal type. They have been added in order to\n       allow screen to be used efficiently as a console multiplexer with 100\n       or more windows.\n\n\n       •  The normal window contains a shell (default, if no parameter is\n\t  given) or any other system command that could be executed from a\n\t  shell (e.g.  slogin, etc...)\n\n\n       •  If a tty (character special device) name (e.g. \"/dev/ttya\") is\n\t  specified as the first parameter, then the window is directly\n\t  connected to this device.  This window type is similar to \"screen cu\n\t  -l /dev/ttya\".  Read and write access is required on the device\n\t  node, an exclusive open is attempted on the node to mark the\n\t  connection line as busy.  An optional parameter is allowed\n\t  consisting of a comma separated list of flags in the notation used\n\t  by stty(1):\n\n\t  <baud_rate>\n\t\t Usually 300, 1200, 9600 or 19200. This affects transmission\n\t\t as well as receive speed.\n\n\t  cs8 or cs7\n\t\t Specify the transmission of eight (or seven) bits per byte.\n\n\t  ixon or -ixon\n\t\t Enables (or disables) software flow-control (CTRL-S/CTRL-Q)\n\t\t for sending data.\n\n\t  ixoff or -ixon\n\t\t Enables (or disables) software flow-control for receiving\n\t\t data.\n\n\t  istrip or -istrip\n\t\t Clear (or keep) the eight bit in each received byte.\n\n\t  You may want to specify as many of these options as applicable.\n\t  Unspecified options cause the terminal driver to make up the\n\t  parameter values of the connection.  These values are system\n\t  dependant and may be in defaults or values saved from a previous\n\t  connection.\n\n\t  For tty windows, the info command shows some of the modem control\n\t  lines in the status line. These may include `RTS', `CTS', 'DTR',\n\t  `DSR', `CD' and more.  This depends on the available ioctl()'s and\n\t  system header files as well as the on the physical capabilities of\n\t  the serial board.  Signals that are logical low (inactive) have\n\t  their name preceded by an exclamation mark (!), otherwise the signal\n\t  is logical high (active).  Signals not supported by the hardware but\n\t  available to the ioctl() interface are usually shown low.\n\t  When the CLOCAL status bit is true, the whole set of modem signals\n\t  is placed inside curly braces ({ and }).  When the CRTSCTS or\n\t  TIOCSOFTCAR bit is set, the signals `CTS' or `CD' are shown in\n\t  parenthesis, respectively.\n\n\n\t  For tty windows, the command break causes the Data transmission line\n\t  (TxD) to go low for a specified period of time. This is expected to\n\t  be interpreted as break signal on the other side.  No data is sent\n\t  and no modem control line is changed when a break is issued.\n\n       •  If the first parameter is \"//telnet\", the second parameter is\n\t  expected to be a host name, and an optional third parameter may\n\t  specify a TCP port number (default decimal 23).  Screen will connect\n\t  to a server listening on the remote host and use the telnet protocol\n\t  to communicate with that server.\n\t  For telnet windows, the command info shows details about the\n\t  connection in square brackets ([ and ]) at the end of the status\n\t  line.\n\n\t  b\t BINARY. The connection is in binary mode.\n\n\t  e\t ECHO. Local echo is disabled.\n\n\t  c\t SGA. The connection is in `character mode' (default: `line\n\t\t mode').\n\n\t  t\t TTYPE. The terminal type has been requested by the remote\n\t\t host.\tScreen sends the name \"screen\" unless instructed\n\t\t otherwise (see also the command `term').\n\n\t  w\t NAWS. The remote site is notified about window size changes.\n\n\t  f\t LFLOW. The remote host will send flow control information.\n\t\t (Ignored at the moment.)\n\n\t  Additional flags for debugging are x, t and n (XDISPLOC, TSPEED and\n\t  NEWENV).\n\n\t  For telnet windows, the command break sends the telnet code IAC\n\t  BREAK (decimal 243) to the remote host.\n\n\n\t  This window type is only available if screen was compiled with the\n\t  BUILTIN_TELNET option defined."

If a\n\t      number is specified, pad to the percentage of the window's\n\t      width.  A '0' qualifier tells screen to treat the number as\n\t      absolute position.  You can specify to pad relative to the last\n\t      absolute pad position by adding a '+' qualifier or to pad\n\t      relative to the right margin by using '-'. The padding truncates\n\t      the string if the specified position lies before the current\n\t      position.

(The area starts from the last absolute pad\n\t      position and ends with the position specified by the truncation\n\t      operator.)

The '0' qualifier also makes\n       the '=' escape use absolute positions. The 'n' and '=' escapes\n       understand a length qualifier (e.g. '%3n'), 'D' and 'M' can be prefixed\n       with 'L' to generate long names, 'w' and 'W' also show the window flags\n       if 'L' is given.\n\n       An attribute/color modifier is is used to change the attributes or the\n       color settings. Its format is \"[attribute modifier] [color\n       description]\". The attribute modifier must be prefixed by a change type\n       indicator if it can be confused with a color desciption. The following\n       change types are known:\n\n       +      add the specified set to the current attributes\n\n       -      remove the set from the current attributes\n\n       !      invert the set in the current attributes\n\n       =      change the current attributes to the specified set\n\n       The attribute set can either be specified as a hexadecimal number or a\n       combination of the following letters:\n\n       d      dim\n       u      underline\n       b      bold\n       r      reverse\n       s      standout\n       B      blinking\n\n       Colors are coded either as a hexadecimal number or two letters\n       specifying the desired background and foreground color (in that order).\n       The following colors are known:\n\n       k      black\n       r      red\n       g      green\n       y      yellow\n       b      blue\n       m      magenta\n       c      cyan\n       w      white\n       d      default color\n       .      leave color unchanged\n\n       The capitalized versions of the letter specify bright colors. You can\n       also use the pseudo-color 'i' to set just the brightness and leave the\n       color unchanged.\n       A one digit/letter color description is treated as foreground or\n       background color dependant on the current attributes: if reverse mode\n       is set, the background color is changed instead of the foreground\n       color.

Also use a red background if this is the active focus.\n\t      Useful for \"caption string\".\n\nFLOW-CONTROL\n       Each window has a flow-control setting that determines how screen deals\n       with the XON and XOFF characters (and perhaps the interrupt character).\n       When flow-control is turned off, screen ignores the XON and XOFF\n       characters, which allows the user to send them to the current program\n       by simply typing them (useful for the emacs editor, for instance).  The\n       trade-off is that it will take longer for output from a \"normal\"\n       program to pause in response to an XOFF.  With flow-control turned on,\n       XON and XOFF characters are used to immediately pause the output of the\n       current window.\tYou can still send these characters to the current\n       program, but you must use the appropriate two-character screen commands\n       (typically \"C-a q\" (xon) and \"C-a s\" (xoff)).  The xon/xoff commands\n       are also useful for typing C-s and C-q past a terminal that intercepts\n       these characters.\n\n       Each window has an initial flow-control value set with either the -f\n       option or the \"defflow\" .screenrc command. Per default the windows are\n       set to automatic flow-switching.  It can then be toggled between the\n       three states 'fixed on', 'fixed off' and 'automatic' interactively with\n       the \"flow\" command bound to \"C-a f\".\n\n       The automatic flow-switching mode deals with flow control using the\n       TIOCPKT mode (like \"rlogin\" does). If the tty driver does not support\n       TIOCPKT, screen tries to find out the right mode based on the current\n       setting of the application keypad - when it is enabled, flow-control is\n       turned off and visa versa.  Of course, you can still manipulate flow-\n       control manually when needed.\n\n       If you're running with flow-control enabled and find that pressing the\n       interrupt key (usually C-c) does not interrupt the display until\n       another 6-8 lines have scrolled by, try running screen with the\n       \"interrupt\" option (add the \"interrupt\" flag to the \"flow\" command in\n       your .screenrc, or use the -i command-line option).  This causes the\n       output that screen has accumulated from the interrupted program to be\n       flushed.  One disadvantage is that the virtual terminal's memory\n       contains the non-flushed version of the output, which in rare cases can\n       cause minor inaccuracies in the output.\tFor example, if you switch\n       screens and return, or update the screen with \"C-a l\" you would see the\n       version of the output you would have gotten without \"interrupt\" being\n       on.  Also, you might need to turn off flow-control (or use auto-flow\n       mode to turn it off automatically) when running a program that expects\n       you to type the interrupt character as input, as it is possible to\n       interrupt the output of the virtual terminal to your physical terminal\n       when flow-control is enabled.  If this happens, a simple refresh of the\n       screen with \"C-a l\" will restore it.  Give each mode a try, and use\n       whichever mode you find more comfortable."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `screen`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nTITLES (naming windows)\n       You can customize each window's name in the window display (viewed with\n       the \"windows\" command (C-a w)) by setting it with one of the title\n       commands.  Normally the name displayed is the actual command name of\n       the program created in the window.  However, it is sometimes useful to\n       distinguish various programs of the same name or to change the name on-\n       the-fly to reflect the current state of the window.\n\n       The default name for all shell windows can be set with the \"shelltitle\"\n       command in the .screenrc file, while all other windows are created with\n       a \"screen\" command and thus can have their name set with the -t option.\n       Interactively, there is the title-string escape-sequence\n       (<esc>kname<esc>\\) and the \"title\" command (C-a A).  The former can be\n       output from an application to control the window's name under software\n       control, and the latter will prompt for a name when typed.  You can\n       also bind pre-defined names to keys with the \"title\" command to set\n       things quickly without prompting.\n\n       Finally, screen has a shell-specific heuristic that is enabled by\n       setting the window's name to \"search|name\" and arranging to have a null\n       title escape-sequence output as a part of your prompt.  The search\n       portion specifies an end-of-prompt search string, while the name\n       portion specifies the default shell name for the window.  If the name\n       ends in a `:' screen will add what it believes to be the current\n       command running in the window to the end of the window's shell name\n       (e.g. \"name:cmd\").  Otherwise the current command name supersedes the\n       shell name while it is running.\n\n       Here's how it works:  you must modify your shell prompt to output a\n       null title-escape-sequence (<esc>k<esc>\\) as a part of your prompt.\n       The last part of your prompt must be the same as the string you\n       specified for the search portion of the title.  Once this is set up,\n       screen will use the title-escape-sequence to clear the previous command\n       name and get ready for the next command.  Then, when a newline is\n       received from the shell, a search is made for the end of the prompt.\n       If found, it will grab the first word after the matched string and use\n       it as the command name.\tIf the command name begins with either '!',\n       '%', or '^' screen will use the first word on the following line (if\n       found) in preference to the just-found name.  This helps csh users get\n       better command names when using job control or history recall commands.\n\n       Here's some .screenrc examples:\n\n\t      screen -t top 2 nice top\n\n       Adding this line to your .screenrc would start a nice-d version of the\n       \"top\" command in window 2 named \"top\" rather than \"nice\".\n\n\t\t   shelltitle '> |csh'\n\t\t   screen 1\n\n       These commands would start a shell with the given shelltitle.  The\n       title specified is an auto-title that would expect the prompt and the\n       typed command to look something like the following:\n\n\t      /usr/joe/src/dir> trn\n\n       (it looks after the '> ' for the command name).\tThe window status\n       would show the name \"trn\" while the command was running, and revert to\n       \"csh\" upon completion.\n\n\t      bind R screen -t '% |root:' su\n\n       Having this command in your .screenrc would bind the key sequence \"C-a\n       R\" to the \"su\" command and give it an auto-title name of \"root:\".  For\n       this auto-title to work, the screen could look something like this:\n\n\t\t   % !em\n\t\t   emacs file.c\n\n       Here the user typed the csh history command \"!em\" which ran the\n       previously entered \"emacs\" command.  The window status would show\n       \"root:emacs\" during the execution of the command, and revert to simply\n       \"root:\" at its completion.\n\n\t\t   bind o title\n\t\t   bind E title \"\"\n\t\t   bind u title (unknown)\n\n       The first binding doesn't have any arguments, so it would prompt you\n       for a title. when you type \"C-a o\".  The second binding would clear an\n       auto-title's current setting (C-a E).  The third binding would set the\n       current window's title to \"(unknown)\" (C-a u).\n\n       One thing to keep in mind when adding a null title-escape-sequence to\n       your prompt is that some shells (like the csh) count all the non-\n       control characters as part of the prompt's length.  If these invisible\n       characters aren't a multiple of 8 then backspacing over a tab will\n       result in an incorrect display.\tOne way to get around this is to use a\n       prompt like this:\n\n\t      set prompt='^[[0000m^[k^[\\% '\n\n       The escape-sequence \"<esc>[0000m\" not only normalizes the character\n       attributes, but all the zeros round the length of the invisible\n       characters up to 8.  Bash users will probably want to echo the escape\n       sequence in the PROMPT_COMMAND:\n\n\t      PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -n -e \"\\033k\\033\\134\"'\n\n       (I used \"134\" to output a `\\' because of a bug in bash v1.04)."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `screen`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nTHE VIRTUAL TERMINAL\n       Each window in a screen session emulates a VT100 terminal, with some\n       extra functions added. The VT100 emulator is hard-coded, no other\n       terminal types can be emulated.\n       Usually screen tries to emulate as much of the VT100/ANSI standard as\n       possible. But if your terminal lacks certain capabilities, the\n       emulation may not be complete. In these cases screen has to tell the\n       applications that some of the features are missing. This is no problem\n       on machines using termcap, because screen can use the $TERMCAP variable\n       to customize the standard screen termcap.\n\n       But if you do a rlogin on another machine or your machine supports only\n       terminfo this method fails. Because of this, screen offers a way to\n       deal with these cases.  Here is how it works:\n\n       When screen tries to figure out a terminal name for itself, it first\n       looks for an entry named \"screen.<term>\", where <term> is the contents\n       of your $TERM variable.\tIf no such entry exists, screen tries \"screen\"\n       (or \"screen-w\" if the terminal is wide (132 cols or more)).  If even\n       this entry cannot be found, \"vt100\" is used as a substitute.\n\n       The idea is that if you have a terminal which doesn't support an\n       important feature (e.g. delete char or clear to EOS) you can build a\n       new termcap/terminfo entry for screen (named \"screen.<dumbterm>\") in\n       which this capability has been disabled. If this entry is installed on\n       your machines you are able to do a rlogin and still keep the correct\n       termcap/terminfo entry.\tThe terminal name is put in the $TERM variable\n       of all new windows.  Screen also sets the $TERMCAP variable reflecting\n       the capabilities of the virtual terminal emulated. Notice that,\n       however, on machines using the terminfo database this variable has no\n       effect.\tFurthermore, the variable $WINDOW is set to the window number\n       of each window.\n\n       The actual set of capabilities supported by the virtual terminal\n       depends on the capabilities supported by the physical terminal.\tIf,\n       for instance, the physical terminal does not support underscore mode,\n       screen does not put the `us' and `ue' capabilities into the window's\n       $TERMCAP variable, accordingly.\tHowever, a minimum number of\n       capabilities must be supported by a terminal in order to run screen;\n       namely scrolling, clear screen, and direct cursor addressing (in\n       addition, screen does not run on hardcopy terminals or on terminals\n       that over-strike).\n\n       Also, you can customize the $TERMCAP value used by screen by using the\n       \"termcap\" .screenrc command, or by defining the variable $SCREENCAP\n       prior to startup.  When the is latter defined, its value will be copied\n       verbatim into each window's $TERMCAP variable.  This can either be the\n       full terminal definition, or a filename where the terminal \"screen\"\n       (and/or \"screen-w\") is defined.\n\n       Note that screen honors the \"terminfo\" .screenrc command if the system\n       uses the terminfo database rather than termcap.\n\n       When the boolean `G0' capability is present in the termcap entry for\n       the terminal on which screen has been called, the terminal emulation of\n       screen supports multiple character sets.  This allows an application to\n       make use of, for instance, the VT100 graphics character set or national\n       character sets.\tThe following control functions from ISO 2022 are\n       supported: lock shift G0 (SI), lock shift G1 (SO), lock shift G2, lock\n       shift G3, single shift G2, and single shift G3.\tWhen a virtual\n       terminal is created or reset, the ASCII character set is designated as\n       G0 through G3.  When the `G0' capability is present, screen evaluates\n       the capabilities `S0', `E0', and `C0' if present. `S0' is the sequence\n       the terminal uses to enable and start the graphics character set rather\n       than SI.  `E0' is the corresponding replacement for SO. `C0' gives a\n       character by character translation string that is used during semi-\n       graphics mode. This string is built like the `acsc' terminfo\n       capability.\n\n       When the `po' and `pf' capabilities are present in the terminal's\n       termcap entry, applications running in a screen window can send output\n       to the printer port of the terminal.  This allows a user to have an\n       application in one window sending output to a printer connected to the\n       terminal, while all other windows are still active (the printer port is\n       enabled and disabled again for each chunk of output).  As a side-\n       effect, programs running in different windows can send output to the\n       printer simultaneously.\tData sent to the printer is not displayed in\n       the window.  The info command displays a line starting `PRIN' while the\n       printer is active.\n\n       Screen maintains a hardstatus line for every window. If a window gets\n       selected, the display's hardstatus will be updated to match the\n       window's hardstatus line. If the display has no hardstatus the line\n       will be displayed as a standard screen message.\tThe hardstatus line\n       can be changed with the ANSI Application Program Command (APC):\n       \"ESC_<string>ESC\\\". As a convenience for xterm users the sequence\n       \"ESC]0..2;<string>^G\" is also accepted.\n\n       Some capabilities are only put into the $TERMCAP variable of the\n       virtual terminal if they can be efficiently implemented by the physical\n       terminal.  For instance, `dl' (delete line) is only put into the\n       $TERMCAP variable if the terminal supports either delete line itself or\n       scrolling regions. Note that this may provoke confusion, when the\n       session is reattached on a different terminal, as the value of $TERMCAP\n       cannot be modified by parent processes.\n\n       The \"alternate screen\" capability is not enabled by default.  Set the\n       altscreen .screenrc command to enable it.\n\n       The following is a list of control sequences recognized by screen.\n       \"(V)\" and \"(A)\" indicate VT100-specific and ANSI- or ISO-specific\n       functions, respectively.\n\n\n       ESC E\t\t\t  Next Line\n\n       ESC D\t\t\t  Index\n\n       ESC M\t\t\t  Reverse Index\n\n       ESC H\t\t\t  Horizontal Tab Set\n\n       ESC Z\t\t\t  Send VT100 Identification String\n\n       ESC 7\t\t     (V)  Save Cursor and Attributes\n\n       ESC 8\t\t     (V)  Restore Cursor and Attributes\n\n       ESC [s\t\t     (A)  Save Cursor and Attributes\n\n       ESC [u\t\t     (A)  Restore Cursor and Attributes\n\n       ESC c\t\t\t  Reset to Initial State\n\n       ESC g\t\t\t  Visual Bell\n\n       ESC Pn p \t\t  Cursor Visibility (97801)\n\n\t   Pn = 6\t\t  Invisible\n\n\t\t7\t\t  Visible\n\n       ESC =\t\t     (V)  Application Keypad Mode\n\n       ESC >\t\t     (V)  Numeric Keypad Mode\n\n       ESC # 8\t\t     (V)  Fill Screen with E's\n\n       ESC \\\t\t     (A)  String Terminator\n\n       ESC ^\t\t     (A)  Privacy Message String (Message Line)\n\n       ESC !\t\t\t  Global Message String (Message Line)\n\n       ESC k\t\t\t  A.k.a.

For\n       standard VT100 emulation the command will always insert a string in the\n       input buffer of the window (see also command stuff in the command\n       table).\tBecause the sequences generated by a keypress can change after\n       a reattach from a different terminal type, it is possible to bind\n       commands to the termcap name of the keys.  Screen will insert the\n       correct binding after each reattach. See the bindkey command for\n       further details on the syntax and examples.\n\n       Here is the table of the default key bindings.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `screen`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nCHARACTER TRANSLATION\n       Screen has a powerful mechanism to translate characters to arbitrary\n       strings depending on the current font and terminal type.  Use this\n       feature if you want to work with a common standard character set (say\n       ISO8851-latin1) even on terminals that scatter the more unusual\n       characters over several national language font pages.\n\n       Syntax:\n\t   XC=<charset-mapping>{,,<charset-mapping>}\n\t   <charset-mapping> := <designator><template>{,<mapping>}\n\t   <mapping> := <char-to-be-mapped><template-arg>\n\n       The things in braces may be repeated any number of times.\n\n       A <charset-mapping> tells screen how to map characters in font\n       <designator> ('B': Ascii, 'A': UK, 'K': german, etc.)  to strings.\n       Every <mapping> describes to what string a single character will be\n       translated. A template mechanism is used, as most of the time the codes\n       have a lot in common (for example strings to switch to and from another\n       charset). Each occurrence of '%' in <template> gets substituted with\n       the <template-arg> specified together with the character. If your\n       strings are not similar at all, then use '%' as a template and place\n       the full string in <template-arg>. A quoting mechanism was added to\n       make it possible to use a real '%'. The '\\' character quotes the\n       special characters '\\', '%', and ','.\n\n       Here is an example:\n\n\t   termcap hp700 'XC=B\\E(K%\\E(B,\\304[,\\326\\\\\\\\,\\334]'\n\n       This tells screen how to translate ISOlatin1 (charset 'B') upper case\n       umlaut characters on a hp700 terminal that has a german charset. '\\304'\n       gets translated to '\\E(K[\\E(B' and so on.  Note that this line gets\n       parsed *three* times before the internal lookup table is built,\n       therefore a lot of quoting is needed to create a single '\\'.\n\n       Another extension was added to allow more emulation: If a mapping\n       translates the unquoted '%' char, it will be sent to the terminal\n       whenever screen switches to the corresponding <designator>. In this\n       special case the template is assumed to be just '%' because the charset\n       switch sequence and the character mappings normally haven't much in\n       common.\n\n       This example shows one use of the extension:\n\n\t   termcap xterm 'XC=K%,%\\E(B,[\\304,\\\\\\\\\\326,]\\334'\n\n       Here, a part of the german ('K') charset is emulated on an xterm.  If\n       screen has to change to the 'K' charset, '\\E(B' will be sent to the\n       terminal, i.e. the ASCII charset is used instead. The template is just\n       '%', so the mapping is straightforward: '[' to '\\304', '\\' to '\\326',\n       and ']' to '\\334'."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `screen`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nVERSION\n       This is version 4.0.2. Its roots are a merge of a custom version 2.3PR7\n       by Wayne Davison and several enhancements to Oliver Laumann's version\n       2.0. Note that all versions numbered 2.x are copyright by Oliver\n       Laumann.\n\nAVAILABILITY\n       The latest official release of screen available via anonymous ftp from\n       gnudist.gnu.org, nic.funet.fi or any other GNU distribution site. The\n       home site of screen is ftp.uni-erlangen.de, in the directory\n       pub/utilities/screen. The subdirectory `private' contains the latest\n       beta testing release. If you want to help, send a note to screen@uni-\n       erlangen.de.\n\nBUGS\n       •  `dm' (delete mode) and `xs' are not handled correctly (they are\n\t  ignored). `xn' is treated as a magic-margin indicator.\n\n       •  Screen has no clue about double-high or double-wide characters.  But\n\t  this is the only area where vttest is allowed to fail.\n\n       •  It is not possible to change the environment variable $TERMCAP when\n\t  reattaching under a different terminal type.\n\n       •  The support of terminfo based systems is very limited. Adding extra\n\t  capabilities to $TERMCAP may not have any effects.\n\n       •  Screen does not make use of hardware tabs.\n\n       •  Screen must be installed as set-uid with owner root on most systems\n\t  in order to be able to correctly change the owner of the tty device\n\t  file for each window.  Special permission may also be required to\n\t  write the file \"/etc/utmp\".\n\n       •  Entries in \"/etc/utmp\" are not removed when screen is killed with\n\t  SIGKILL.  This will cause some programs (like \"w\" or \"rwho\") to\n\t  advertise that a user is logged on who really isn't.\n\n       •  Screen may give a strange warning when your tty has no utmp entry.\n\n       •  When the modem line was hung up, screen may not automatically detach\n\t  (or quit) unless the device driver is configured to send a HANGUP\n\t  signal.  To detach a screen session use the -D or -d command line\n\t  option.\n\n       •  If a password is set, the command line options -d and -D still\n\t  detach a session without asking.\n\n       •  Both \"breaktype\" and \"defbreaktype\" change the break generating\n\t  method used by all terminal devices. The first should change a\n\t  window specific setting, where the latter should change only the\n\t  default for new windows.\n\n       •  When attaching to a multiuser session, the user's .screenrc file is\n\t  not sourced. Each user's personal settings have to be included in\n\t  the .screenrc file from which the session is booted, or have to be\n\t  changed manually.\n\n       •  A weird imagination is most useful to gain full advantage of all the\n\t  features.\n\n       •  Send bug-reports, fixes, enhancements, t-shirts, money, beer & pizza\n\t  to screen@uni-erlangen.de."
