Updating to a newer version of macOS may allow the\n     device to mount.\n     Volume Hash Mismatch - The cryptographic integrity of the volume is not\n     valid. Reinstalling macOS on this volume will fix its integrity.\n\n     The APFSUserAgent uses the defaults bundle com.apple.APFSUserAgent in\n     order to control whether or not to pop notifications or automatically ask\n     the user to unlock an encrypted volume.\n     The settings are controlled globally - for all devices, or locally - for\n     a specific volume or container, identified by its UUID.  In the defaults\n     dictionary, the key is the action that the user would like to mute, and\n     the value is the date to mute up to.  APFSUserAgent Will use the system\n     timezone."
