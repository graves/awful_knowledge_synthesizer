A domain\n     manages the execution policy for a collection of services.  A service may\n     be thought of as a virtual process that is always available to be spawned\n     in response to demand. Each service has a collection of endpoints, and\n     sending a message to one of those endpoints will cause the service to\n     launch on demand. Domains advertise these endpoints in a shared namespace\n     and may be thought of as synonymous with Mach bootstrap subsets.\n\n     Many subcommands in launchctl take a specifier which indicates the target\n     domain or service for the subcommand. This specifier may take one of the\n     following forms:"
