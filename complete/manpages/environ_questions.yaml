By convention these strings have the form\n     “name=value”.  The following names are used by various commands:\n\n     BLOCKSIZE\t  The size of the block units used by several commands, most\n\t\t  notably df(1), du(1) and ls(1).  This variable is processed\n\t\t  by the getbsize(3) function.\n\n     COLUMNS\t  The user's preferred width in column positions for the\n\t\t  terminal.  Utilities such as ls(1) and who(1) use this to\n\t\t  format output into columns.  If unset or empty, utilities\n\t\t  will use an ioctl(2) call to ask the terminal driver for the\n\t\t  width.\n\n     EDITOR\t  Default editor name.\n\n     EXINIT\t  A startup list of commands read by ex(1) and vi(1).\n\n     HOME\t  A user's login directory, set by login(1) from the password\n\t\t  file passwd(5)."
