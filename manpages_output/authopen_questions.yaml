In its\n     simplest form, authopen verifies that it is allowed to open filename\n     (using an appropriate sys.openfile.* authorization right) and then writes\n     the file to stdout.  If -w is specified, authopen will read from stdin\n     and write to the file.\n\n     authopen is designed to be used both from the command line and\n     programmatically.\tThe -stdoutpipe flag allows a parent process to\n     receive an open file descriptor pointing to the file in question.\n\n     Before opening filename, authopen will make an authorization request for\n     a right of the form:"

The authorization should refer to the sys.apenfile\n\t     right corresponding to the requested operation.  The\n\t     authorization data will be read before any additional data\n\t     supplied on stdin, and will not be included in data written with\n\t     -w."
