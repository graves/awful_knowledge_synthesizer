Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.\n\n       -v     Run in verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to standard\n\t      output.\n\n       -d_debuglevel\n\t      Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapwhoami must be\n\t      compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this option to have any\n\t      effect."
