An icon consists of one or\n       more images usually with varying resolution and color depth. Each icon\n       and image has a resource identifier which may be a text string or a\n       positive integer value. Most commands use this identifier to specify\n       which icon or image to operate on.\n\nAPI\n       ::ico::icons file ?option value...?\n\t      Returns a list of icons found in file where each element is the\n\t      name or numeric ID. Recognizes the following options:\n\n\t      -type fileFormat"
