A\n     column is defined as a single character in a line.  Input is read from\n     the standard input.  Output is written to the standard output.\n\n     If only the start column is specified, columns numbered less than the\n     start column will be written.  If both start and stop columns are\n     specified, columns numbered less than the start column or greater than\n     the stop column will be written.  Column numbering starts with one, not\n     zero.\n\n     Tab characters increment the column count to the next multiple of eight.\n     Backspace characters decrement the column count by one.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n     The LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the execution\n     of colrm as described in environ(7).\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The colrm utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.\n\nEXAMPLES\n     Show columns below 3 (c) and above 5 (e):\n\n\t   $ echo -e \"abcdefgh\\n12345678\" | colrm 3 5\n\t   abfgh\n\t   12678\n\n     Specifying a start column bigger than the number of columns in the file\n     is allowed and shows all the columns:\n\n\t   $ echo \"abcdefgh\" | colrm 100\n\t   abcdefgh\n\n     Using 1 as start column will show nothing:\n\n\t   $ echo \"abcdefgh\" | colrm 1"
