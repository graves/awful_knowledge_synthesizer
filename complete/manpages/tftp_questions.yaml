The remote host may be specified on the command line, in\n     which case tftp uses host as the default host for future transfers (see\n     the connect command below).\n\n     The optional -e argument sets the blocksize to the largest supported\n     value and enables the TFTP timeout option as if the tout command had been\n     given.  In previous versions of tftp, it also enabled binary mode and the\n     TFTP blksize option; these are now on by default.\n\nCOMMANDS\n     Once tftp is running, it issues the prompt “tftp>” and recognizes the\n     following commands:\n\n     ? command-name ...\n\t      Print help information.\n\n     ascii    Shorthand for \"mode ascii\"\n\n     binary   Shorthand for \"mode binary\""

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tftp`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nblocksize [size]\n\t      Sets the TFTP blksize option in TFTP Read Request or Write\n\t      Request packets to [size] as specified in RFC 2348.  Valid\n\t      values are between 8 and 65464.  If no blocksize is specified,\n\t      then by default a blocksize of 512 bytes will be used.\n\n     blocksize2 [size]\n\t      Sets the TFTP blksize2 option in TFTP Read Request or Write\n\t      Request packets to [size].  Values are restricted to powers of 2\n\t      between 8 and 32768.  This is a non-standard TFTP option.\n\n     connect host [port]\n\t      Set the host (and optionally port) for transfers.  Note that the\n\t      TFTP protocol, unlike the FTP protocol, does not maintain\n\t      connections between transfers; thus, the connect command does\n\t      not actually create a connection, but merely remembers what host\n\t      is to be used for transfers.  You do not have to use the connect\n\t      command; the remote host can be specified as part of the get or\n\t      put commands.\n\n     debug level\n\t      Enable or disable debugging levels during verbose output.  The\n\t      value of level can be one of packet, simple, options, or access."
