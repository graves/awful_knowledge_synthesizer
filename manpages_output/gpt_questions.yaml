The general options are described in the\n     following paragraph.  The remaining paragraphs describe the individual\n     commands with their options.  Here we conclude by mentioning that a\n     device is either a special file corresponding to a disk-like device or a\n     regular file.  The command is applied to each device listed on the\n     command line.\n\n   General Options\n     The general options allow the user to change default settings or\n     otherwise change the behaviour that is applicable to all commands.  Not\n     all commands use all default settings, so some general options may not\n     have an effect on all commands."

This is used whenever a new GPT is created.  By\n     default, the gpt utility will create space for 128 partitions (or 32\n     sectors of 512 bytes).\n\n     The -r option causes the gpt utility to open the device for reading only.\n     Currently this option is primarily useful for the show command, but the\n     intent is to use it to implement dry-run behaviour.\n\n     The -v option controls the verbosity level.  The level increases with\n     every occurrence of this option.  There is no formalized definition of\n     the different levels yet.\n\n   Commands\n     gpt add [-b number] [-i index] [-s count] [-t type] device ...\n\t     The add command allows the user to add a new partition to an\n\t     existing table.
