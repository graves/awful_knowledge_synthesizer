Diffstat is a\n       program that is useful for reviewing large, complex patch files.  It\n       reads from one or more input files which contain output from diff,\n       producing a histogram of the total lines changed for each file\n       referenced.\n\n       If the input filename ends with “.bz2”, “.gz”, “.lzma”, “.xz”, “.z” or\n       “.Z”, diffstat will read the uncompressed data via a pipe from the\n       corresponding program.  It also can infer the compression type from\n       files piped via the standard input.\n\n       Diffstat recognizes the most popular types of output from diff:\n\n\t  unified\n\t\t preferred by the patch utility.\n\n\t  context\n\t\t best for readability, but not very compact."

These\n       are shown in the histogram as \"+\", \"-\" and \"!\" characters.\n\n       If no filename is given on the command line, diffstat reads the\n       differences from the standard input.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -b     ignore lines matching \"Binary files XXX and YYY differ\" in the\n\t      diff\n\n       -c     prefix each line of output with \"#\", making it a comment-line\n\t      for shell scripts.\n\n       -C     add SGR color escape sequences to highlight the histogram.\n\n       -D destination\n\t      specify a directory containing files which can be referred to as\n\t      the result of applying the differences.  diffstat will count the\n\t      lines in the corresponding files (after adjusting the names by\n\t      the -p option) to obtain the total number of lines in each file."
