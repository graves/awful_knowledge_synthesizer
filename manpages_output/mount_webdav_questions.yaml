Note: If this option is not set, sending authentication\n\t     credentials insecurely to the server will be allowed but will be\n\t     logged.\n\n     -S      Suppresses all user interface including the authentication\n\t     dialogs and the non-responsive (\"disconnect\") server dialogs. If\n\t     the server connection becomes non-responsive, the file system is\n\t     immediately unmounted when this option has been used."
