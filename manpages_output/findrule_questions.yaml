- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `findrule`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nFINDRULE(1)\t      User Contributed Perl Documentation\t   FINDRULE(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       findrule - command line wrapper to File::Find::Rule\n\nUSAGE\n\t findrule [path...] [expression]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       \"findrule\" mostly borrows the interface from GNU find(1) to provide a\n       command-line interface onto the File::Find::Rule heirarchy of modules.\n\n       The syntax for expressions is the rule name, preceded by a dash,\n       followed by an optional argument.  If the argument is an opening\n       parenthesis it is taken as a list of arguments, terminated by a closing\n       parenthesis.\n\n       Some examples:\n\n\tfind -file -name ( foo bar )\n\n       files named \"foo\" or \"bar\", below the current directory.\n\n\tfind -file -name foo -bar\n\n       files named \"foo\", that have pubs (for this is what our ficticious\n       \"bar\" clause specifies), below the current directory.\n\n\tfind -file -name ( -bar )\n\n       files named \"-bar\", below the current directory.  In this case if we'd\n       have omitted the parenthesis it would have parsed as a call to name\n       with no arguments, followed by a call to -bar.\n\n   Supported switches\n       I'm very slack.\tPlease consult the File::Find::Rule manpage for now,\n       and prepend - to the commands that you want.\n\n   Extra bonus switches\n       findrule automatically loads all of your installed File::Find::Rule::*\n       extension modules, so check the documentation to see what those would\n       be.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Richard Clamp <richardc@unixbeard.net> from a suggestion by Tatsuhiko\n       Miyagawa\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (C) 2002 Richard Clamp.
