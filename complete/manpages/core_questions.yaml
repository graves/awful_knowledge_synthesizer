(See\n     sigaction(2).) This memory image is written to a file named by default\n     core.pid, where pid is the process ID of the process, in the /cores\n     directory, provided the terminated process had write permission in the\n     directory, and the directory existed.\n\n     The maximum size of a core file is limited by setrlimit(2).  Files which\n     would be larger than the limit are not created.\n\n     The core file consists of the Mach-O(5) header as\tdescribed in the\n     ⟨mach-o/loader.h⟩ file.  The remainder of the core file consists of\n     various sections described in the Mach-O(5) header.\n\nNOTE\n     Core dumps are disabled by default under Darwin/macOS.  To re-enable core\n     dumps, do one of the following"
