Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `notifyd`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nnotifyd(8)\t\t    System Manager's Manual\t\t    notifyd(8)\n\nNAME\n     notifyd â€“ notification server\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     notifyd [-d] [-log_file path] [-shm_pages npages]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     notifyd is the server for the Mac OS X notification system described in\n     notify(3).  The server is started automatically by launchd during system\n     startup.\n\n     The -d option causes notifyd to log debugging messages to a log file.\n     Messages are not logged to ASL to avoid potential deadlocks, since the\n     ASL system makes use of the notify(3) system.\n\n     The default log file is /var/log/notifyd.log.  An alternate log file path\n     may be specified following the -log_file flag.\n\n     The -shm_pages npages option sets the number of shared memory pages used\n     for passive notification.\tThe default is one page.  If a value of zero\n     is specified, shared memory is disabled and passive notifications are\n     performed using IPC between the client and the server.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     notify(3).\n\nMac OS X\t\t\tMarch 24, 2003\t\t\t      Mac OS X"
