The following option-value pairs are possible as\n       command line arguments:\n\n       -initialdir dirname\n\t      Specifies that the directories in directory should be displayed\n\t      when the dialog pops up. If this parameter is not specified,\n\t      then the directories in the current working directory are\n\t      displayed. If the parameter specifies a relative path, the\n\t      return value will convert the relative path to an absolute path.\n\n       -mustexist boolean\n\t      Specifies whether the user may specify non-existent directories.\n\t      If this parameter is true, then the user may only select\n\t      directories that already exist.  The default value is false.\n\n       -parent window\n\t      Makes window the logical parent of the dialog. The dialog is\n\t      displayed on top of its parent window. On Mac OS X, this turns\n\t      the file dialog into a sheet attached to the parent window.\n\n       -title titleString\n\t      Specifies a string to display as the title of the dialog box. If\n\t      this option is not specified, then a default title will be\n\t      displayed.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\t      set dir [tk_chooseDirectory \\\n\t\t      -initialdir ~ -title \"Choose a directory\"]\n\t      if {$dir eq \"\"} {\n\t\t label .l -text \"No directory selected\"\n\t      } else {\n\t\t label .l -text \"Selected $dir\"\n\t      }"
