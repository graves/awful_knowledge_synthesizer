The number of valid elements contained in\n     the array (not the number of elements the array has space reserved for)\n     is given in the integer pointed to by nelp.  The compar argument points\n     to a function which compares its two arguments and returns zero if they\n     are matching, and non-zero otherwise."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the lsearch function?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use lsearch to find a specific element in an array of integers?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using lsearch to search for a string in an array of strings?

If no element was found, lsearch() returns a pointer to the newly\n     added element, whereas lfind() returns NULL.  Both functions return NULL\n     if an error occurs.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     bsearch(3), hsearch(3), tsearch(3)\n\nSTANDARDS\n     The lsearch() and lfind() functions conform to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001\n     (“POSIX.1”).\n\nHISTORY\n     The lsearch() and lfind() functions appeared in 4.2BSD.
