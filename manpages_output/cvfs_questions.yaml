Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `cvfs`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nCVFS(8) \t\t    System Manager's Manual\t\t       CVFS(8)\n\nNAME\n       /etc/init.d/cvfs - Initialization script for Xsan File System\n       components\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       service cvfs {start|stop|restart|fullstop}\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The Xsan File System can be controlled by the system init(8) mechanism.\n       For more information on the init.d services reference the init(8) and\n       chkconfig(8) man pages.\n\n       This initialization script responds to the normal start, stop and\n       restart commands.  This allows the Xsan File System to be started and\n       stopped at any time, and the fullstop option unloads CVFS kernel\n       modules.\n\n       Note: Take care not to trigger an HA reset action on a server when it\n       has been configured for High Availability (HA).\tFor more information\n       about HA reference the snhamgr(8) man page.\n\n       See the init(8) or chkconfig(8) man pages for additional startup and\n       shutdown options.\n\n       On Solaris clients, StorNext File System Services have been integrated\n       into the Solaris service management facility, smf.  The cvfs script is\n       located in /System/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents/bin.\n\nStarting Xsan Services\n       The service cvfs start command should be executed only after local file\n       systems are mounted and the network is initialized.  The following\n       steps are executed:\n\t  — CVFS kernel modules are loaded.\n\t  — Base Xsan services are started.  This includes the Xsan portmapper\n\t    service and any needed HBA drivers.\n\t  — Any Xsan metadata servers included in the fsmlist(4) file are\n\t    started automatically.\n\t  — Xsan volumes included in the systems fstab(5) or vfstab(4) file\n\t    are mounted.\n\t  — Xsan Storage Manager (SNSM) components are started if they are\n\t    installed.\n\nStopping Xsan Services\n       The service cvfs stop command should be executed before the network is\n       brought down and before the local filesystems are unmounted.  The\n       following steps are executed:\n\t  — SNSM components are stopped.\n\t  — All Xsan volumes are unmounted.\n\t  — All Xsan server components are shut down.\n\n       The kernel modules are not unloaded unless the fullstop option is used.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n       Only the Linux and Unix platforms are supported for utilizing\n       /etc/init.d/cvfs\n\nFILES\n       /etc/init.d/cvfs\n\nSEE ALSO\n       mount(8), snhamgr(8), fsmlist(4), vfstab(4), fstab(5), init.d(7),\n       chkconfig(8)\n\nXsan File System\t\t December 2021\t\t\t       CVFS(8)"
