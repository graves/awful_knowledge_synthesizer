It\n       must be configured on both servers.  The ha_peer file may also be used\n       to change the default IP port (5189) used by the snhamgr_daemon and\n       snhamgr processes.\n\n       The ha_peer IP address allows the fsmpm processes to negotiate the\n       restarting of HA Timers to avoid unnecessary HA Reset incidents when\n       metadata writes are delayed by heavy disk activity, and to detect\n       misconfigured /Library/Preferences/Xsan/ha_smith_interval HA Timer\n       override values.  For HA clusters with an HaShared file system, the\n       address also allows communication between the snhamgr_daemon processes\n       running on the metadata controllers to collect operational status for\n       the snhamgr command."

The address and port entries are specified as\n       follows:\n\n\t  <address>\n       or\n\n\t  <address>:<port>\n\n       For IPv6, enclose the address portion in square brackets if also\n       specifying a port.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       To set the peer address, the ha_peer file would contain the following\n       line:\n\n\t  192.168.10.1\n\n       To set the peer address and port, the ha_peer file would contain the\n       following line:\n\n\t  192.168.10.1:8888\n\n       To set an IPv6 address or address and port, the following lines could\n       be specified:\n\n\t  fe80::250:56ff:fe9b:74b8\n\n       or\n\n\t  [fe80::250:56ff:fe9b:74b8]:4600\n\nFILES\n       /Library/Preferences/Xsan/ha_peer\n\nSEE ALSO\n       snhamgr(8), fsmpm(8), Quantum StorNext User's Guide\n\nXsan File System\t\t December 2014\t\t\t    HA_PEER(4)"
