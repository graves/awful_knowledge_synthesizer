Supported values are \"warn\" and\n     \"critical\".\n\n     -p <percent_free> Allocate memory till the available memory in the system\n     is <percent_free> of total memory.  If the percentage of available memory\n     to total memory on the system drops, the tool will free memory till\n     either the desired percentage is achieved or it runs out of memory to\n     free.\n\n     -S Simulate memory pressure on the system by placing it artificially for\n     <sleep_seconds> duration at the \"warn\" or \"critical\" level.\n\n     -s <sleep_seconds> Duration to wait before allocating or freeing memory\n     if applying real pressure.  In case of simulating memory pressure, this\n     is the duration the system will be maintained at an artificial memory\n     level."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the memory_pressure tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use memory_pressure to simulate memory pressure at the 'critical' level for 10 seconds?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using memory_pressure to allocate memory until available memory is 20% of the total system memory?
