The\n       first form, binary format, creates a binary string from normal Tcl\n       values.\tFor example, given the values 16 and 22, on a 32-bit\n       architecture, it might produce an 8-byte binary string consisting of\n       two 4-byte integers, one for each of the numbers.  The second form of\n       the command, binary scan, does the opposite: it extracts data from a\n       binary string and returns it as ordinary Tcl string values.\n\nBINARY FORMAT\n       The binary format command generates a binary string whose layout is\n       specified by the formatString and whose contents come from the\n       additional arguments.  The resulting binary value is returned."

Each field specifier is a\n       single type character followed by an optional flag character followed\n       by an optional numeric count.  Most field specifiers consume one\n       argument to obtain the value to be formatted.  The type character\n       specifies how the value is to be formatted.

The resulting binary string contains the four numbers 1.0,\n       2.0, 3.0 and 0.1.\n\n       Each type-count pair moves an imaginary cursor through the binary data,\n       storing bytes at the current position and advancing the cursor to just\n       after the last byte stored.

    BINARY SCAN
           The binary scan command parses fields from a binary string, returning
           the number of conversions performed.  String gives the input bytes to
           be parsed (one byte per character, and characters not representable as
           a byte have their high bits chopped) and formatString indicates how to
           parse it.  Each varName gives the name of a variable; when a field is
           scanned from string the result is assigned to the corresponding
           variable.

           As with binary format, the formatString consists of a sequence of zero
           or more field specifiers separated by zero or more spaces.  Each field
           specifier is a single type character followed by an optional flag
           character followed by an optional numeric count.  Most field specifiers
           consume one argument to obtain the variable into which the scanned
           values should be placed.  The type character specifies how the binary
           data is to be interpreted.  The count typically indicates how many
           items of the specified type are taken from the data.  If present, the
           count is a non-negative decimal integer or *, which normally indicates
           that all of the remaining items in the data are to be used.  If there
           are not enough bytes left after the current cursor position to satisfy
           the current field specifier, then the corresponding variable is left
           untouched and binary scan returns immediately with the number of
           variables that were set.  If there are not enough arguments for all of
           the fields in the format string that consume arguments, then an error
           is generated. The flag character “u” may be given to cause some types
           to be read as unsigned values. The flag is accepted for all field types
           but is ignored for non-integer fields.
