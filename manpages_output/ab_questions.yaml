It is designed to give you an impression of how your\n       current Apache installation performs. This especially shows you how\n       many requests per second your Apache installation is capable of\n       serving."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `ab`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nOPTIONS\n       -A auth-username:password\n\t      Supply BASIC Authentication credentials to the server. The\n\t      username and password are separated by a single : and sent on\n\t      the wire base64 encoded. The string is sent regardless of\n\t      whether the server needs it (i.e., has sent an 401\n\t      authentication needed).\n\n       -b windowsize\n\t      Size of TCP send/receive buffer, in bytes.\n\n       -B local-address\n\t      Address to bind to when making outgoing connections.\n\n       -c concurrency\n\t      Number of multiple requests to perform at a time. Default is one\n\t      request at a time.\n\n       -C cookie-name=value\n\t      Add a Cookie: line to the request. The argument is typically in\n\t      the form of a name=value pair. This field is repeatable.\n\n       -d     Do not display the \"percentage served within XX [ms] table\".\n\t      (legacy support).\n\n       -e csv-file\n\t      Write a Comma separated value (CSV) file which contains for each\n\t      percentage (from 1% to 100%) the time (in milliseconds) it took\n\t      to serve that percentage of the requests. This is usually more\n\t      useful than the 'gnuplot' file; as the results are already\n\t      'binned'.\n\n       -E client-certificate-file\n\t      When connecting to an SSL website, use the provided client\n\t      certificate in PEM format to authenticate with the server. The\n\t      file is expected to contain the client certificate, followed by\n\t      intermediate certificates, followed by the private key.\n\t      Available in 2.4.36 and later.\n\n       -f protocol\n\t      Specify SSL/TLS protocol (SSL2, SSL3, TLS1, TLS1.1, TLS1.2, or\n\t      ALL). TLS1.1 and TLS1.2 support available in 2.4.4 and later.\n\n       -g gnuplot-file\n\t      Write all measured values out as a 'gnuplot' or TSV (Tab\n\t      separate values) file. This file can easily be imported into\n\t      packages like Gnuplot, IDL, Mathematica, Igor or even Excel. The\n\t      labels are on the first line of the file.\n\n       -h     Display usage information.\n\n       -H custom-header\n\t      Append extra headers to the request. The argument is typically\n\t      in the form of a valid header line, containing a colon-separated\n\t      field-value pair (i.e., \"Accept-Encoding: zip/zop;8bit\").\n\n       -i     Do HEAD requests instead of GET.\n\n       -k     Enable the HTTP KeepAlive feature, i.e., perform multiple\n\t      requests within one HTTP session. Default is no KeepAlive.\n\n       -l     Do not report errors if the length of the responses is not\n\t      constant. This can be useful for dynamic pages. Available in\n\t      2.4.7 and later.\n\n       -m HTTP-method\n\t      Custom HTTP method for the requests. Available in 2.4.10 and\n\t      later.\n\n       -n requests\n\t      Number of requests to perform for the benchmarking session. The\n\t      default is to just perform a single request which usually leads\n\t      to non-representative benchmarking results.\n\n       -p POST-file\n\t      File containing data to POST. Remember to also set -T.\n\n       -P proxy-auth-username:password\n\t      Supply BASIC Authentication credentials to a proxy en-route. The\n\t      username and password are separated by a single : and sent on\n\t      the wire base64 encoded. The string is sent regardless of\n\t      whether the proxy needs it (i.e., has sent an 407 proxy\n\t      authentication needed).\n\n       -q     When processing more than 150 requests, ab outputs a progress\n\t      count on stderr every 10% or 100 requests or so. The -q flag\n\t      will suppress these messages.\n\n       -r     Don't exit on socket receive errors.\n\n       -s timeout\n\t      Maximum number of seconds to wait before the socket times out.\n\t      Default is 30 seconds. Available in 2.4.4 and later.\n\n       -S     Do not display the median and standard deviation values, nor\n\t      display the warning/error messages when the average and median\n\t      are more than one or two times the standard deviation apart. And\n\t      default to the min/avg/max values. (legacy support).\n\n       -t timelimit\n\t      Maximum number of seconds to spend for benchmarking. This\n\t      implies a -n 50000 internally. Use this to benchmark the server\n\t      within a fixed total amount of time. Per default there is no\n\t      timelimit.\n\n       -T content-type\n\t      Content-type header to use for POST/PUT data, eg. application/x-\n\t      www-form-urlencoded. Default is text/plain.\n\n       -u PUT-file\n\t      File containing data to PUT. Remember to also set -T.\n\n       -v verbosity\n\t      Set verbosity level - 4 and above prints information on headers,\n\t      3 and above prints response codes (404, 200, etc.), 2 and above\n\t      prints warnings and info.\n\n       -V     Display version number and exit.\n\n       -w     Print out results in HTML tables. Default table is two columns\n\t      wide, with a white background.\n\n       -x <table>-attributes\n\t      String to use as attributes for <table>. Attributes are inserted\n\t      <table here >.\n\n       -X proxy[:port]\n\t      Use a proxy server for the requests.\n\n       -y <tr>-attributes\n\t      String to use as attributes for <tr>.\n\n       -z <td>-attributes\n\t      String to use as attributes for <td>.\n\n       -Z ciphersuite\n\t      Specify SSL/TLS cipher suite (See openssl ciphers)\n\n\nOUTPUT\n       The following list describes the values returned by ab:"
