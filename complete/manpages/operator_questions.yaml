  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the operator manual entry?
  manpageQuestion2: How does the precedence and associativity of operators affect the evaluation of expressions in C?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain the difference between the associativity of the assignment operators (e.g., =, +=) and the logical operators (e.g., &&, ||)?
