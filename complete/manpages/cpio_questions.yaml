This implementation\n     can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, and ISO 9660 cdrom images\n     and can create tar, pax, cpio, ar, and shar archives.\n\n     The first option to cpio is a mode indicator from the following list:\n     -i      Input.  Read an archive from standard input (unless overridden)\n\t     and extract the contents to disk or (if the -t option is\n\t     specified) list the contents to standard output.  If one or more\n\t     file patterns are specified, only files matching one of the\n\t     patterns will be extracted.\n     -o      Output.  Read a list of filenames from standard input and produce\n\t     a new archive on standard output (unless overridden) containing\n\t     the specified items.\n     -p      Pass-through.  Read a list of filenames from standard input and\n\t     copy the files to the specified directory."

They first appeared in 1977 in\n     PWB/UNIX 1.0, the “Programmer's Work Bench” system developed for use\n     within AT&T.  They were first released outside of AT&T as part of System\n     III Unix in 1981.\tAs a result, cpio actually predates tar, even though\n     it was not well-known outside of AT&T until some time later.\n\n     This is a complete re-implementation based on the libarchive(3) library.\n\nBUGS\n     The cpio archive format has several basic limitations: It does not store\n     user and group names, only numbers.  As a result, it cannot be reliably\n     used to transfer files between systems with dissimilar user and group\n     numbering.  Older cpio formats limit the user and group numbers to 16 or\n     18 bits, which is insufficient for modern systems.  The cpio archive\n     formats cannot support files over 4 gigabytes, except for the “odc”\n     variant, which can support files up to 8 gigabytes."
