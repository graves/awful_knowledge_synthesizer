    Manpage text:

    Like filters, backends must be capable of reading from a filename on
           the command-line or from the standard input, copying the standard input
           to a temporary file as required by the physical interface.

           The command name (argv[0]) is set to the device URI of the destination
           printer.  Authentication information in argv[0] is removed, so backend
           developers are urged to use the DEVICE_URI environment variable
           whenever authentication information is required. The
           cupsBackendDeviceURI() function may be used to retrieve the correct
           device URI.

           Back-channel data from the device should be relayed to the job filters
           using the cupsBackChannelWrite function.

           Backends are responsible for reading side-channel requests using the
           cupsSideChannelRead() function and responding with the
           cupsSideChannelWrite() function. The CUPS_SC_FD constant defines the
           file descriptor that should be monitored for incoming requests.
