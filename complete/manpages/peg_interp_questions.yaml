In other words, the grammar is not pre-compiled but used\n       as is.\n\n       The grammar to be interpreted is taken from a container object\n       following the interface specified by the package\n       grammar::peg::container. Only the relevant parts are copied into the\n       state of this package.\n\n       It should be noted that the package provides exactly one instance of\n       the interpreter, and interpreting a second grammar requires the user to\n       either abort or complete a running interpretation, or to put them into\n       different Tcl interpreters.\n\n       Also of note is that the implementation assumes a pull-type handling of\n       the input. In other words, the interpreter pulls characters from the\n       input stream as it needs them. For usage in a push environment, i.e.\n       where the environment pushes new characters as they come we have to put\n       the engine into its own thread.\n\nTHE INTERPRETER API\n       The package exports the following API\n\n       ::grammar::peg::interp::setup peg\n\t      This command (re)initializes the interpreter. It returns the\n\t      empty string. This command has to be invoked first, before any\n\t      matching run.\n\n\t      Its argument peg is the handle of an object containing the\n\t      parsing expression grammar to interpret. This grammar has to be\n\t      valid, or an error will be thrown.\n\n       ::grammar::peg::interp::parse nextcmd errorvar astvar\n\t      This command interprets the loaded grammar and tries to match it\n\t      against the stream of characters represented by the command\n\t      prefix nextcmd.\n\n\t      The command prefix nextcmd represents the input stream of\n\t      characters and is invoked by the interpreter whenever the a new\n\t      character from the stream is required.  The callback has to\n\t      return either the empty list, or a list of 4 elements containing\n\t      the token, its lexeme attribute, and its location as line number\n\t      and column index, in this order.\tThe empty list is the signal\n\t      that the end of the input stream has been reached. The lexeme\n\t      attribute is stored in the terminal cache, but otherwise not\n\t      used by the machine.\n\n\t      The result of the command is a boolean value indicating whether\n\t      the matching process was successful (true), or not (false). In\n\t      the case of a match failure error information will be stored\n\t      into the variable referenced by errorvar. The variable\n\t      referenced by astvar will always contain the generated abstract\n\t      syntax tree, however in the case of an error it will be only\n\t      partial and possibly malformed.\n\n\t      The abstract syntax tree is represented by a nested list, as\n\t      described in section AST VALUES of document grammar::me_ast.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category\n       grammar_peg of the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].
