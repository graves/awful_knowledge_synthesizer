If you've used\n       -OPT:fast_io=ON and this happens, try removing it.  If that fails, or\n       you didn't use that, then try adjusting other optimization options\n       (-LNO, -INLINE, -O3 to -O2, et cetera).\tThe compiler bug has been\n       reported to SGI.  (Allen Smith <easmith@beatrice.rutgers.edu>)\n\n   Linker Problems in Irix\n       If you get complaints about so_locations then search in the file\n       hints/irix_6.sh for \"lddflags\" and do the suggested adjustments.\n       (David Billinghurst <David.Billinghurst@riotinto.com.au>)\n\n   Malloc in Irix\n       Do not try to use Perl's malloc, this will lead into very mysterious\n       errors (especially with -Duse64bitall).\n\n   Building with threads in Irix\n       Run Configure with -Duseithreads which will configure Perl with the\n       Perl 5.8.0 \"interpreter threads\", see threads.\n\n       For Irix 6.2 with perl threads, you have to have the following patches\n       installed:\n\n\t       1404 Irix 6.2 Posix 1003.1b man pages\n\t       1645 Irix 6.2 & 6.3 POSIX header file updates\n\t       2000 Irix 6.2 Posix 1003.1b support modules\n\t       2254 Pthread library fixes\n\t       2401 6.2 all platform kernel rollup\n\n       IMPORTANT: Without patch 2401, a kernel bug in Irix 6.2 will cause your\n       machine to panic and crash when running threaded perl.  Irix 6.3 and\n       later are okay.\n\n\t   Thanks to Hannu Napari <Hannu.Napari@hut.fi> for the IRIX\n\t   pthreads patches information.\n\n   Irix 5.3\n       While running Configure and when building, you are likely to get quite\n       a few of these warnings:\n\n\t ld:\n\t The shared object /usr/lib/libm.so did not resolve any symbols.\n\t       You may want to remove it from your link line.\n\n       Ignore them: in IRIX 5.3 there is no way to quieten ld about this.\n\n       During compilation you will see this warning from toke.c:\n\n\t uopt: Warning: Perl_yylex: this procedure not optimized because it\n\t       exceeds size threshold; to optimize this procedure, use -Olimit\n\t       option with value >= 4252.\n\n       Ignore the warning.\n\n       In IRIX 5.3 and with Perl 5.8.1 (Perl 5.8.0 didn't compile in IRIX 5.3)\n       the following failures are known.\n\n\tFailed Test\t\t     Stat Wstat Total Fail  Failed  List of Failed\n\t-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t../ext/List/Util/t/shuffle.t\t0   139    ??\t??\t %  ??\n\t../lib/Math/Trig.t\t      255 65280    29\t12  41.38%  24-29\n\t../lib/sort.t\t\t\t0   138   119\t72  60.50%  48-119\n\t56 tests and 474 subtests skipped.\n\tFailed 3/811 test scripts, 99.63% okay. 78/75813 subtests failed,\n\t   99.90% okay.\n\n       They are suspected to be compiler errors (at least the shuffle.t\n       failure is known from some IRIX 6 setups) and math library errors (the\n       Trig.t failure), but since IRIX 5 is long since end-of-lifed, further\n       fixes for the IRIX are unlikely.  If you can get gcc for 5.3, you could\n       try that, too, since gcc in IRIX 6 is a known workaround for at least\n       the shuffle.t and sort.t failures.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Jarkko Hietaniemi <jhi@iki.fi>\n\n       Please report any errors, updates, or suggestions to\n       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t\t   PERLIRIX(1)"
