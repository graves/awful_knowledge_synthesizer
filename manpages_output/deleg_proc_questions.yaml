All invokations of this\n\t      procedure will delegate the actual work to the remote location\n\t      identified by the comm channel comm and the endpoint id.\n\n\t      The name of the remote procedure invoked by the delegator is\n\t      [namespace tail name]. I.e., namespace information is stripped\n\t      from the call.\n\n\t      Normally the generated procedure marshalls the arguments, and\n\t      returns the result from the remote procedure as its own result.\n\t      If however the option -async was specified then the generated\n\t      procedure will not wait for a result and return immediately.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category interp of\n       the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       comm, delegation, interpreter, procedure\n\nCATEGORY\n       Programming tools\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2006 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the deleg_proc command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use deleg_proc to create a delegated procedure that calls a remote procedure named 'remoteProc' with arguments 'arg1' and 'arg2', using the comm channel 'myComm' and endpoint id '123'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using deleg_proc with the -async option to create a procedure that immediately returns without waiting for a result?
