The result is called\n       a Normalized Lemon Grammar Tree.\n\n       Note that this package can only be used from within a plugin managed by\n       the package page::pluginmgr.\n\nAPI\n       ::page::util::norm::lemon tree\n\t      This command assumes the tree object contains for a lemon\n\t      grammar. It normalizes this tree in place. The result is called\n\t      a Normalized Lemon Grammar Tree.\n\n\t      The exact operations performed are left undocumented for the\n\t      moment.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, will undoubtedly contain bugs and other problems.\n       Please report such in the category page of the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].
