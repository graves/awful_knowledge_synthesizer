This imposes a direction upon the arc, which\n       is said to go from the source to the target. It is allowed that source\n       and target of an arc are the same node. Such an arc is called a loop.\n       Whenever a node is either the source or target of an arc both are said\n       to be adjacent. This extends into a relation between nodes, i.e. if two\n       nodes are connected through at least one arc they are said to be\n       adjacent too.\n\n       Each node can be the source and target for any number of arcs. The\n       former are called the outgoing arcs of the node, the latter the\n       incoming arcs of the node. The number of arcs in either set is called\n       the in-degree resp. the out-degree of the node.\n\n       In addition to maintaining the node and arc relationships, this graph\n       implementation allows any number of named attributes to be associated\n       with the graph itself, and each node or arc.\n\n       Note: The major version of the package struct has been changed to\n       version 2.0, due to backward incompatible changes in the API of this\n       module. Please read the section Changes for 2.0 for a full list of all\n       changes, incompatible and otherwise.\n\n       Note: A C-implementation of the command can be had from the location\n       http://www.purl.org/NET/schlenker/tcl/cgraph. See also\n       http://wiki.tcl.tk/cgraph.  This implementation uses a bit less memory\n       than the tcl version provided here directly, and is faster. Its support\n       is limited to versions of the package before 2.0.\n\n       As of version 2.2 of this package a critcl based C implementation is\n       available from here as well. This implementation however requires Tcl\n       8.4 to run.\n\n       The main command of the package is:\n\n       ::struct::graph ?graphName? ?=|:=|as|deserialize source?\n\t      The command creates a new graph object with an associated global\n\t      Tcl command whose name is graphName.  This command may be used\n\t      to invoke various operations on the graph.  It has the following\n\t      general form:\n\n\t      graphName option ?arg arg ...?\n\t\t     Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the\n\t\t     command.\n\n       If graphName is not specified a unique name will be generated by the\n       package itself. If a source is specified the new graph will be\n       initialized to it. For the operators =, :=, and as the source argument\n       is interpreted as the name of another graph object, and the assignment\n       operator = will be executed. For the operator deserialize the source is\n       a serialized graph object and deserialize will be executed.\n\n       In other words"

Restrictions can limit the\n\t      list of returned nodes based on neighboring nodes, or based on\n\t      the keyed values associated with the node. The restrictions that\n\t      involve neighboring nodes have a list of nodes as argument,\n\t      specified after the name of the restriction itself.\n\n\t      The possible restrictions are the same as for method arcs.

The command recognizes:\n\n\t      -in    Return a list of all nodes with at least one outgoing arc\n\t\t     ending in a node found in the specified set of nodes.\n\t\t     Alternatively specified as the set of source nodes for\n\t\t     the -in arcs of the node set. The incoming neighbours.\n\n\t      -out   Return a list of all nodes with at least one incoming arc\n\t\t     starting in a node found in the specified set of nodes.\n\t\t     Alternatively specified as the set of target nodes for\n\t\t     the -out arcs of the node set. The outgoing neighbours.\n\n\t      -adj   This is the union of the nodes returned by -in and -out.\n\t\t     The neighbours.\n\n\t      -inner The set of neighbours (see -adj above) which are also in\n\t\t     the set of nodes. I.e. the intersection between the set\n\t\t     of nodes and the neighbours per -adj.\n\n\t      -embedding\n\t\t     The set of neighbours (see -adj above) which are not in\n\t\t     the set of nodes. I.e. the difference between the\n\t\t     neighbours as per -adj, and the set of nodes.\n\n\t      -key key\n\t\t     Limit the list of nodes that are returned to those nodes\n\t\t     that have an associated key key.\n\n\t      -value value\n\t\t     This restriction can only be used in combination with\n\t\t     -key. It limits the list of nodes that are returned to\n\t\t     those nodes whose associated key key has the value value.\n\n\t      -filter cmdrefix\n\t\t     Limit the list of nodes that are returned to those nodes\n\t\t     that pass the test. The command in cmdprefix is called\n\t\t     with two arguments, the name of the graph object, and the\n\t\t     name of the node in question. It is executed in the\n\t\t     context of the caller and has to return a boolean value.\n\t\t     Nodes for which the command returns false are removed\n\t\t     from the result list before it is returned to the caller.\n\n       graphName get key\n\t      Return the value associated with the key key for the graph.\n\n       graphName getall ?pattern?\n\t      Returns a dictionary (suitable for use with [array set]) for the\n\t      whole graph.  If the pattern is specified only the attributes\n\t      whose names match the pattern will be part of the returned\n\t      dictionary. The pattern is a glob pattern.\n\n       graphName keys ?pattern?\n\t      Returns a list of keys for the whole graph.  If the pattern is\n\t      specified only the attributes whose names match the pattern will\n\t      be part of the returned list. The pattern is a glob pattern.\n\n       graphName keyexists key\n\t      Return true if the specified key exists for the whole graph.\n\n       graphName serialize ?node...?\n\t      This method serializes the sub-graph spanned up by the nodes. In\n\t      other words it returns a tcl value completely describing that\n\t      graph. If no nodes are specified the whole graph will be\n\t      serialized.  This allows, for example, the transfer of graph\n\t      objects (or parts thereof) over arbitrary channels, persistence,\n\t      etc.  This method is also the basis for both the copy\n\t      constructor and the assignment operator.\n\n\t      The result of this method has to be semantically identical over\n\t      all implementations of the graph interface. This is what will\n\t      enable us to copy graph data between different implementations\n\t      of the same interface.\n\n\t      The result is a list containing a multiple of three items, plus\n\t      one!  In other words, '[llength $serial] % 3 == 1'. Valid values\n\t      include 1, 4, 7, ...\n\n\t      The last element of the list is a dictionary containing the\n\t      attributes associated with the whole graph.  Regarding the other\n\t      elements; each triple consists of\n\n\t      [1]    The name of the node to be described,\n\n\t      [2]    A dictionary containing the attributes associated with\n\t\t     the node,\n\n\t      [3]    And a list describing all the arcs starting at that node.\n\n       The elements of the arc list are lists containing three or four\n       elements each, i.e.\n\n\t      [1]    The name of the arc described by the element,\n\n\t      [2]    A reference to the destination node of the arc. This\n\t\t     reference is an integer number given the index of that\n\t\t     node in the main serialization list. As that it is\n\t\t     greater than or equal to zero, less than the length of\n\t\t     the serialization, and a multiple of three.  Note: For\n\t\t     internal consistency no arc name may be used twice,\n\t\t     whether in the same node, or at some other node. This is\n\t\t     a global consistency requirement for the serialization.\n\n\t      [3]    And a dictionary containing the attributes associated\n\t\t     with the arc.\n\n\t      [4]    The weight associated with the arc. This value is\n\t\t     optional. Its non-presence means that the arc in question\n\t\t     has no weight associated with it.\n\n\t\t     Note: This information is new, compared to the\n\t\t     serialization of graph 2.3 and earlier. By making it an\n\t\t     optional element the new format is maximally compatible\n\t\t     with the old. This means that any graph not using weights\n\t\t     will generate a serialization which is still understood\n\t\t     by the older graph package. A serialization will not be\n\t\t     understood any longer by the older packages if, and only\n\t\t     if the graph it was generated from actually has arcs with\n\t\t     weights.\n\n       For all attribute dictionaries they keys are the names of the\n       attributes, and the values are the values for each name.\n\n       Note: The order of the nodes in the serialization has no relevance, nor\n       has the order of the arcs per node.\n\n\t   # A possible serialization for the graph structure\n\t   #\n\t   #\t    d -----> %2\n\t   #\t   /\t     ^ \\\\\n\t   #\t  /\t    /\t\\\\\n\t   #\t /\t   b\t \\\\\n\t   #\t/\t  /\t  \\\\\n\t   #  %1 <- a - %0\t   e\n\t   #\t^\t  \\\\\t  /\n\t   #\t \\\\\t   c\t /\n\t   #\t  \\\\\t    \\\\\t/\n\t   #\t   \\\\\t     v v\n\t   #\t    f ------ %3\n\t   # is\n\t   #\n\t   # %3 {} {{f 6 {}}} %0 {} {{a 6 {}} {b 9 {}} {c 0 {}}} %1 {} {{d 9 {}}} %2 {} {{e 0 {}}} {}\n\t   #\n\t   # This assumes that the graph has neither attribute data nor weighted arcs."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `graph`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\ngraphName set key ?value?\n\t      Set or get one of the keyed values associated with a graph. A\n\t      graph may have any number of keyed values associated with it. If\n\t      value is not specified, this command returns the current value\n\t      assigned to the key; if value is specified, this command assigns\n\t      that value to the key.\n\n       graphName swap node1 node2\n\t      Swap the position of node1 and node2 in the graph.\n\n       graphName unset key\n\t      Remove a keyed value from the graph. The method will do nothing\n\t      if the key does not exist.\n\n       graphName walk node ?-order order? ?-type type? ?-dir direction?\n       -command cmd\n\t      Perform a breadth-first or depth-first walk of the graph\n\t      starting at the node node going in either the direction of\n\t      outgoing or opposite to the incoming arcs.\n\n\t      The type of walk, breadth-first or depth-first, is determined by\n\t      the value of type; bfs indicates breadth-first, dfs indicates\n\t      depth-first.  Depth-first is the default.\n\n\t      The order of the walk, pre-order, post-order or both-order is\n\t      determined by the value of order; pre indicates pre-order, post\n\t      indicates post-order, both indicates both-order. Pre-order is\n\t      the default. Pre-order walking means that a node is visited\n\t      before any of its neighbors (as defined by the direction, see\n\t      below). Post-order walking means that a parent is visited after\n\t      any of its neighbors. Both-order walking means that a node is\n\t      visited before and after any of its neighbors. The combination\n\t      of a breadth-first walk with post- or both-order is illegal.\n\n\t      The direction of the walk is determined by the value of dir;\n\t      backward indicates the direction opposite to the incoming arcs,\n\t      forward indicates the direction of the outgoing arcs.\n\n\t      As the walk progresses, the command cmd will be evaluated at\n\t      each node, with the mode of the call (enter or leave) and values\n\t      graphName and the name of the current node appended. For a pre-\n\t      order walk, all nodes are entered, for a post-order all nodes\n\t      are left. In a both-order walk the first visit of a node enters\n\t      it, the second visit leaves it.\n\nCHANGES FOR 2.0\n       The following noteworthy changes have occurred:\n\n       [1]    The API for accessing attributes and their values has been\n\t      simplified.\n\n\t      All functionality regarding the default attribute \"data\" has\n\t      been removed. This default attribute does not exist anymore. All\n\t      accesses to attributes have to specify the name of the attribute\n\t      in question. This backward incompatible change allowed us to\n\t      simplify the signature of all methods handling attributes.\n\n\t      Especially the flag -key is not required anymore, even more, its\n\t      use is now forbidden. Please read the documentation for the arc\n\t      and node methods set, get, getall, unset, append, lappend,\n\t      keyexists and keys for a description of the new API's.\n\n       [2]    The methods keys and getall now take an optional pattern\n\t      argument and will return only attribute data for keys matching\n\t      this pattern.\n\n       [3]    Arcs and nodes can now be renamed. See the documentation for the\n\t      methods arc rename and node rename.\n\n       [4]    The structure has been extended with API's for the serialization\n\t      and deserialization of graph objects, and a number of operations\n\t      based on them (graph assignment, copy construction).\n\n\t      Please read the documentation for the methods serialize,\n\t      deserialize, =, and -->, and the documentation on the\n\t      construction of graph objects.\n\n\t      Beyond the copying of whole graph objects these new API's also\n\t      enable the transfer of graph objects over arbitrary channels and\n\t      for easy persistence.\n\n       [5]    A new method, attr, was added to both arc and node allowing the\n\t      query and retrieval of attribute data without regard to arc and\n\t      node relationships.\n\n       [6]    Both methods arcs and nodes have been extended with the ability\n\t      to select arcs and nodes based on an arbitrary filtering\n\t      criterium.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
