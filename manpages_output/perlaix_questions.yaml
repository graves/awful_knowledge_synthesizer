    NAME
           perlaix - Perl version 5 on IBM AIX (UNIX) systems

    DESCRIPTION
           This document describes various features of IBM's UNIX operating system
           AIX that will affect how Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is
           compiled and/or runs.

       Compiling Perl 5 on AIX
           For information on compilers on older versions of AIX, see "Compiling
           Perl 5 on older AIX versions up to 4.3.3".

           When compiling Perl, you must use an ANSI C compiler. AIX does not ship
           an ANSI compliant C compiler with AIX by default, but binary builds of
           gcc for AIX are widely available. A version of gcc is also included in
           the AIX Toolbox which is shipped with AIX.

       Supported Compilers
           Currently all versions of IBM's "xlc", "xlc_r", "cc", "cc_r" or "vac"
           ANSI/C compiler will work for building Perl if that compiler works on
           your system.

           If you plan to link Perl to any module that requires thread-support,
           like DBD::Oracle, it is better to use the _r version of the compiler.
           This will not build a threaded Perl, but a thread-enabled Perl. See
           also "Threaded Perl" later on.

You can circumvent this problem by adding -qipa to the\n       optimization flags (-Doptimize='-O -qipa').  The PTF for APAR IZ35785\n       which solves this problem is available from IBM (April 2009 PTF for XL\n       C/C++ Enterprise Edition for AIX, V9.0).\n\n       If you choose XL C/C++ V11 you need the April 2010 PTF (or newer)\n       installed otherwise you will not get a working Perl version.\n\n       Perl can be compiled with either IBM's ANSI C compiler or with gcc.\n       The former is recommended, as not only it can compile Perl with no\n       difficulty, but also can take advantage of features listed later that\n       require the use of IBM compiler-specific command-line flags."

       Using Large Files with Perl
           Should yield no problems.

       Threaded Perl
           Should yield no problems with AIX 5.1 / 5.2 / 5.3 / 6.1 / 7.1.

           IBM uses the AIX system Perl (V5.6.0 on AIX 5.1 and V5.8.2 on AIX 5.2 /
           5.3 and 6.1; V5.8.8 on AIX 5.3 TL11 and AIX 6.1 TL4; V5.10.1 on AIX
           7.1) for some AIX system scripts. If you switch the links in /usr/bin
           from the AIX system Perl (/usr/opt/perl5) to the newly build Perl then
           you get the same features as with the IBM AIX system Perl if the
           threaded options are used.

           The threaded Perl build works also on AIX 5.1 but the IBM Perl build
           (Perl v5.6.0) is not threaded on AIX 5.1.

           Perl 5.12 an newer is not compatible with the IBM fileset perl.libext.

       64-bit Perl
           If your AIX system is installed with 64-bit support, you can expect
           64-bit configurations to work. If you want to use 64-bit Perl on AIX
           6.1 you need an APAR for a libc.a bug which affects (n)dbm_XXX
           functions.  The APAR number for this problem is IZ39077.

In\n       newer AIX releases this has been solved by linking Perl with the libC_r\n       library, but unfortunately in AIX 4.2 the said library has an obscure\n       bug where the various functions related to time (such as time() and\n       gettimeofday()) return broken values, and therefore in AIX 4.2 Perl is\n       not linked against the libC_r."
