Also, the ordering of hash keys has always been, and continues to\n       be, affected by the insertion order.\n\n       The added randomness may affect applications.\n\n       One possible scenario is when output of an application has included\n       hash data.  For example, if you have used the Data::Dumper module to\n       dump data into different files, and then compared the files to see\n       whether the data has changed, now you will have false positives since\n       the order in which hashes are dumped will vary.\tIn general the cure is\n       to sort the keys (or the values); in particular for Data::Dumper to use\n       the \"Sortkeys\" option.  If some particular order is really important,\n       use tied hashes: for example the Tie::IxHash module which by default\n       preserves the order in which the hash elements were added.\n\n       More subtle problem is reliance on the order of \"global destruction\".\n       That is what happens at the end of execution: Perl destroys all data\n       structures, including user data.  If your destructors (the DESTROY\n       subroutines) have assumed any particular ordering to the global\n       destruction, there might be problems ahead.  For example, in a\n       destructor of one object you cannot assume that objects of any other\n       class are still available, unless you hold a reference to them.\tIf the\n       environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL is set to a non-zero value, or\n       if Perl is exiting a spawned thread, it will also destruct the ordinary\n       references and the symbol tables that are no longer in use.  You can't\n       call a class method or an ordinary function on a class that has been\n       collected that way."

    The hash randomisation is certain to reveal hidden assumptions about
           some particular ordering of hash elements, and outright bugs: it
           revealed a few bugs in the Perl core and core modules.

           To disable the hash randomisation in runtime, set the environment
           variable PERL_HASH_SEED to 0 (zero) before running Perl (for more
           information see "PERL_HASH_SEED" in perlrun), or to disable the feature
           completely in compile time, compile with "-DNO_HASH_SEED" (see
           INSTALL).

           See "Algorithmic Complexity Attacks" in perlsec for the original
           rationale behind this change.

       UTF-8 On Filehandles No Longer Activated By Locale
           In Perl 5.8.0 all filehandles, including the standard filehandles, were
           implicitly set to be in Unicode UTF-8 if the locale settings indicated
           the use of UTF-8.  This feature caused too many problems, so the
           feature was turned off and redesigned: see "Core Enhancements".

       Single-number v-strings are no longer v-strings before "=>"
           The version strings or v-strings (see "Version Strings" in perldata)
           feature introduced in Perl 5.6.0 has been a source of some confusion--
           especially when the user did not want to use it, but Perl thought it
           knew better.  Especially troublesome has been the feature that before a
           "=>" a version string (a "v" followed by digits) has been interpreted
           as a v-string instead of a string literal.  In other words:

Hardly what you had\n       in mind unless you were aware of this feature of Perl 5.8.0.  The\n       problem is that the vast majority of people weren't: for example in\n       RedHat releases 8 and 9 the default locale setting is UTF-8, so all\n       RedHat users got UTF-8 filehandles, whether they wanted it or not.

    Therefore a decision was made to backtrack the feature and change it
           from implicit silent default to explicit conscious option.  The new
           Perl command line option "-C" and its counterpart environment variable
           PERL_UNICODE can now be used to control how Perl and Unicode interact
           at interfaces like I/O and for example the command line arguments.  See
           "-C" in perlrun and "PERL_UNICODE" in perlrun for more information.

       Unsafe signals again available
           In Perl 5.8.0 the so-called "safe signals" were introduced.  This means
           that Perl no longer handles signals immediately but instead "between
           opcodes", when it is safe to do so.  The earlier immediate handling
           easily could corrupt the internal state of Perl, resulting in
           mysterious crashes.

           However, the new safer model has its problems too.  Because now an
           opcode, a basic unit of Perl execution, is never interrupted but
           instead let to run to completion, certain operations that can take a
           long time now really do take a long time.  For example, certain network
           operations have their own blocking and timeout mechanisms, and being
           able to interrupt them immediately would be nice.

    Manpage text:

    The Perl debugger (lib/perl5db.pl) has now been extensively documented
           and bugs found while documenting have been fixed.

           "perldoc" has been rewritten from scratch to be more robust and feature
           rich.

           "perlcc -B" works now at least somewhat better, while "perlcc -c" is
           rather more broken.  (The Perl compiler suite as a whole continues to
           be experimental.)

    New Documentation
           perl573delta has been added to list the differences between the (now
           quite obsolete) development releases 5.7.2 and 5.7.3.

           perl58delta has been added: it is the perldelta of 5.8.0, detailing the
           differences between 5.6.0 and 5.8.0.

           perlartistic has been added: it is the Artistic License in pod format,
           making it easier for modules to refer to it.

           perlcheat has been added: it is a Perl cheat sheet.

           format, making it easier for modules to refer to it.

    Installation and Configuration Improvements
           The Unix standard Perl location, /usr/bin/perl, is no longer
           overwritten by default if it exists.  This change was very prudent
           because so many Unix vendors already provide a /usr/bin/perl, but
           simultaneously many system utilities may depend on that exact version
           of Perl, so better not to overwrite it.

           One can now specify installation directories for site and vendor man
           and HTML pages, and site and vendor scripts.  See INSTALL.

           One can now specify a destination directory for Perl installation by
           specifying the DESTDIR variable for "make install".  (This feature is
           slightly different from the previous "Configure -Dinstallprefix=...".)

    Known Problems
           The hash randomisation mentioned in "Incompatible Changes" is
           definitely problematic: it will wake dormant bugs and shake out bad
           assumptions.

           If you want to use mod_perl 2.x with Perl 5.8.1, you will need
           mod_perl-1.99_10 or higher.  Earlier versions of mod_perl 2.x do not
           work with the randomised hashes.  (mod_perl 1.x works fine.)  You will
           also need Apache::Test 1.04 or higher.

           Many of the rarer platforms that worked 100% or pretty close to it with
           perl 5.8.0 have been left a little bit untended since their maintainers
           have been otherwise busy lately, and therefore there will be more
           failures on those platforms.  Such platforms include Mac OS Classic,
           IBM z/OS (and other EBCDIC platforms), and NetWare.  The most common
           Perl platforms (Unix and Unix-like, Microsoft platforms, and VMS) have
           large enough testing and expert population that they are doing well.

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perl581delta`.



    Manpage text:

    if (%tied_hash) { ... }

           The current nonsensical behaviour is always to return false, regardless
           of whether the hash is empty or has elements.

           The root cause is that there is no interface for the implementors of
           tied hashes to implement the behaviour of a hash in scalar context.

       Net::Ping 450_service and 510_ping_udp failures
           The subtests 9 and 18 of lib/Net/Ping/t/450_service.t, and the subtest
           2 of lib/Net/Ping/t/510_ping_udp.t might fail if you have an unusual
           networking setup.  For example in the latter case the test is trying to
           send a UDP ping to the IP address 127.0.0.1.

       B::C
           The C-generating compiler backend B::C (the frontend being "perlcc -c")
           is even more broken than it used to be because of the extensive lexical
           variable changes.  (The good news is that B::Bytecode and ByteLoader
           are better than they used to be.)

    Platform Specific Problems
       EBCDIC Platforms
           IBM z/OS and other EBCDIC platforms continue to be problematic
           regarding Unicode support.  Many Unicode tests are skipped when they
           really should be fixed.

    Manpage text:

    The warnings show up both during the build of Perl and during certain
           lib/ExtUtils tests that invoke the C compiler.  The warning, however,
           is not serious and can be ignored.

       IRIX: t/uni/tr_7jis.t falsely failing
           The test t/uni/tr_7jis.t is known to report failure under 'make test'
           or the test harness with certain releases of IRIX (at least IRIX 6.5
           and MIPSpro Compilers Version 7.3.1.1m), but if run manually the test
           fully passes.

       Mac OS X: no usemymalloc
           The Perl malloc ("-Dusemymalloc") does not work at all in Mac OS X.
           This is not that serious, though, since the native malloc works just
           fine.

       Tru64: No threaded builds with GNU cc (gcc)
           In the latest Tru64 releases (e.g. v5.1B or later) gcc cannot be used
           to compile a threaded Perl (-Duseithreads) because the system
           "<pthread.h>" file doesn't know about gcc.

       Win32: sysopen, sysread, syswrite
           As of the 5.8.0 release, sysopen()/sysread()/syswrite() do not behave
           like they used to in 5.6.1 and earlier with respect to "text" mode.
           These built-ins now always operate in "binary" mode (even if sysopen()
           was passed the O_TEXT flag, or if binmode() was used on the file
           handle).  Note that this issue should only make a difference for disk
           files, as sockets and pipes have always been in "binary" mode in the
           Windows port.  As this behavior is currently considered a bug,
           compatible behavior may be re-introduced in a future release.  Until
           then, the use of sysopen(), sysread() and syswrite() is not supported
           for "text" mode operations.
