A complete set of shell functions based on\n       these features is described in zshcompsys(1), and users with no\n       interest in adding to that system (or, potentially, writing their own\n       -- see dictionary entry for `hubris') should skip the current section.\n       The older system based on the compctl builtin command is described in\n       zshcompctl(1).\n\n       Completion widgets are defined by the -C option to the zle builtin\n       command provided by the zsh/zle module (see zshzle(1)). For example,\n\n\t      zle -C complete expand-or-complete completer\n\n       defines a widget named `complete'.  The second argument is the name of\n       any of the builtin widgets that handle completions: complete-word,\n       expand-or-complete, expand-or-complete-prefix, menu-complete,\n       menu-expand-or-complete, reverse-menu-complete, list-choices, or\n       delete-char-or-list.  Note that this will still work even if the widget\n       in question has been re-bound."

    Manpage text:

    When this newly defined widget is bound to a key using the bindkey
           builtin command defined in the zsh/zle module (see zshzle(1)), typing
           that key will call the shell function `completer'. This function is
           responsible for generating completion matches using the builtins
           described below.  As with other ZLE widgets, the function is called
           with its standard input closed.

           Once the function returns, the completion code takes over control again
           and treats the matches in the same manner as the specified builtin
           widget, in this case expand-or-complete.

    COMPLETION SPECIAL PARAMETERS
           The parameters ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS and ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS are
           used by the completion mechanism, but are not special. See Parameters
           Used By The Shell in zshparam(1).

           Inside completion widgets, and any functions called from them, some
           parameters have special meaning; outside these functions they are not
           special to the shell in any way.  These parameters are used to pass
           information between the completion code and the completion widget. Some
           of the builtin commands and the condition codes use or change the
           current values of these parameters.  Any existing values will be hidden
           during execution of completion widgets; except for compstate, the
           parameters are reset on each function exit (including nested function
           calls from within the completion widget) to the values they had when
           the function was entered.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `zshcompwid`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-S suffix\n\t\t     Like -P, but gives a string to be inserted after each\n\t\t     match.\n\n\t      -p hidden-prefix\n\t\t     This gives a string that should be inserted before each\n\t\t     match but that should not appear in the list of matches.\n\t\t     Unless the -U option is given, this string must be\n\t\t     matched as part of the string on the command line.\n\n\t      -s hidden-suffix\n\t\t     Like `-p', but gives a string to insert after each match.\n\n\t      -i ignored-prefix\n\t\t     This gives a string to insert just before any string\n\t\t     given with the `-P' option.  Without `-P' the string is\n\t\t     inserted before the string given with `-p' or directly\n\t\t     before each match.\n\n\t      -I ignored-suffix\n\t\t     Like -i, but gives an ignored suffix.\n\n\t      -a     With this flag the completions are taken as names of\n\t\t     arrays and the actual completions are their values.  If\n\t\t     only some elements of the arrays are needed, the\n\t\t     completions may also contain subscripts, as in\n\t\t     `foo[2,-1]'.\n\n\t      -k     With this flag the completions are taken as names of\n\t\t     associative arrays and the actual completions are their\n\t\t     keys.  As for -a, the words may also contain subscripts,\n\t\t     as in `foo[(R)*bar*]'.\n\n\t      -d array\n\t\t     This adds per-completion display strings. The array\n\t\t     should contain one element per completion given. The\n\t\t     completion code will then display the first element\n\t\t     instead of the first completion, and so on. The array may\n\t\t     be given as the name of an array parameter or directly as\n\t\t     a space-separated list of words in parentheses.\n\n\t\t     If there are fewer display strings than completions, the\n\t\t     leftover completions will be displayed unchanged and if\n\t\t     there are more display strings than completions, the\n\t\t     leftover display strings will be silently ignored.\n\n\t      -l     This option only has an effect if used together with the\n\t\t     -d option. If it is given, the display strings are listed\n\t\t     one per line, not arrayed in columns.\n\n\t      -o [ order ]\n\t\t     This controls the order in which matches are sorted.\n\t\t     order is a comma-separated list comprising the following\n\t\t     possible values.  These values can be abbreviated to\n\t\t     their initial two or three characters.  Note that the\n\t\t     order forms part of the group name space so matches with\n\t\t     different orderings will not be in the same group.\n\n\t\t     match  If given, the order of the output is determined by\n\t\t\t    the match strings; otherwise it is determined by\n\t\t\t    the display strings (i.e. the strings given by the\n\t\t\t    -d option). This is the default if `-o' is\n\t\t\t    specified but the order argument is omitted.\n\n\t\t     nosort This specifies that the completions are pre-sorted\n\t\t\t    and their order should be preserved.  This value\n\t\t\t    only makes sense alone and cannot be combined with\n\t\t\t    any others.\n\n\t\t     numeric\n\t\t\t    If the matches include numbers, sort them\n\t\t\t    numerically rather than lexicographically.\n\n\t\t     reverse\n\t\t\t    Arrange the matches backwards by reversing the\n\t\t\t    sort ordering.\n\n\t      -J group-name\n\t\t     Gives the name of the group that the matches should be\n\t\t     stored in.\n\n\t      -V group-name\n\t\t     Like -J but naming an unsorted group. This option is\n\t\t     identical to the combination of -J and -o nosort.\n\n\t      -1     If given together with the -V option, makes only\n\t\t     consecutive duplicates in the group be removed. If\n\t\t     combined with the -J option, this has no visible effect.\n\t\t     Note that groups with and without this flag are in\n\t\t     different name spaces.\n\n\t      -2     If given together with the -J or -V option, makes all\n\t\t     duplicates be kept. Again, groups with and without this\n\t\t     flag are in different name spaces.\n\n\t      -X explanation\n\t\t     The explanation string will be printed with the list of\n\t\t     matches, above the group currently selected.\n\n\t\t     Within the explanation, the following sequences may be\n\t\t     used to specify output attributes as described in the\n\t\t     section EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1):\n\t\t     `%B', `%S', `%U', `%F', `%K' and their lower case\n\t\t     counterparts, as well as `%{...%}'.  `%F', `%K' and\n\t\t     `%{...%}' take arguments in the same form as prompt\n\t\t     expansion.  (Note that the sequence `%G' is not\n\t\t     available; an argument to `%{' should be used instead.)\n\t\t     The sequence `%%' produces a literal `%'.\n\n\t\t     These sequences are most often employed by users when\n\t\t     customising the format style (see zshcompsys(1)), but\n\t\t     they must also be taken into account when writing\n\t\t     completion functions, as passing descriptions with\n\t\t     unescaped `%' characters to utility functions such as\n\t\t     _arguments and _message may produce unexpected results.\n\t\t     If arbitrary text is to be passed in a description, it\n\t\t     can be escaped using e.g. ${my_str//\\%/%%}.\n\n\t      -x message\n\t\t     Like -X, but the message will be printed even if there\n\t\t     are no matches in the group.\n\n\t      -q     The suffix given with -S will be automatically removed if\n\t\t     the next character typed is a blank or does not insert\n\t\t     anything, or if the suffix consists of only one character\n\t\t     and the next character typed is the same character.\n\n\t      -r remove-chars\n\t\t     This is a more versatile form of the -q option.  The\n\t\t     suffix given with -S or the slash automatically added\n\t\t     after completing directories will be automatically\n\t\t     removed if the next character typed inserts one of the\n\t\t     characters given in the remove-chars.  This string is\n\t\t     parsed as a characters class and understands the\n\t\t     backslash sequences used by the print command.  For\n\t\t     example, `-r \"a-z\\t\"' removes the suffix if the next\n\t\t     character typed inserts a lower case character or a TAB,\n\t\t     and `-r \"^0-9\"' removes the suffix if the next character\n\t\t     typed inserts anything but a digit. One extra backslash\n\t\t     sequence is understood in this string: `\\-' stands for\n\t\t     all characters that insert nothing. Thus `-S \"=\" -q' is\n\t\t     the same as `-S \"=\" -r \"= \\t\\n\\-\"'.\n\n\t\t     This option may also be used without the -S option; then\n\t\t     any automatically added space will be removed when one of\n\t\t     the characters in the list is typed.\n\n\t      -R remove-func\n\t\t     This is another form of the -r option. When a match has\n\t\t     been accepted and a suffix has been inserted, the\n\t\t     function remove-func will be called after the next\n\t\t     character typed.  It is passed the length of the suffix\n\t\t     as an argument and can use the special parameters\n\t\t     available in ordinary (non-completion) zle widgets (see\n\t\t     zshzle(1)) to analyse and modify the command line.\n\n\t      -f     If this flag is given, all of the matches built from the\n\t\t     completions are marked as being the names of files.  They\n\t\t     are not required to be actual filenames, but if they are,\n\t\t     and the option LIST_TYPES is set, the characters\n\t\t     describing the types of the files in the completion lists\n\t\t     will be shown. This also forces a slash to be added when\n\t\t     the name of a directory is completed.\n\n\t      -e     This flag can be used to tell the completion code that\n\t\t     the matches added are parameter names for a parameter\n\t\t     expansion. This will make the AUTO_PARAM_SLASH and\n\t\t     AUTO_PARAM_KEYS options be used for the matches.\n\n\t      -W file-prefix\n\t\t     This string is a pathname that will be prepended to each\n\t\t     match together with any prefix specified by the -p option\n\t\t     to form a complete filename for testing.  Hence it is\n\t\t     only useful if combined with the -f flag, as the tests\n\t\t     will not otherwise be performed.\n\n\t      -F array\n\t\t     Specifies an array containing patterns.  completions that\n\t\t     match one of these patterns are ignored, that is, not\n\t\t     considered to be matches.\n\n\t\t     The array may be the name of an array parameter or a list\n\t\t     of literal patterns enclosed in parentheses and quoted,\n\t\t     as in `-F \"(*?.o *?.h)\"'. If the name of an array is\n\t\t     given, the elements of the array are taken as the\n\t\t     patterns.\n\n\t      -Q     This flag instructs the completion code not to quote any\n\t\t     metacharacters in the matches when inserting them into\n\t\t     the command line.\n\n\t      -M match-spec\n\t\t     This gives local match specifications as described below\n\t\t     in the section `Completion Matching Control'. This option\n\t\t     may be given more than once.  In this case all\n\t\t     match-specs given are concatenated with spaces between\n\t\t     them to form the specification string to use.  Note that\n\t\t     they will only be used if the -U option is not given.\n\n\t      -n     Specifies that matching completions are to be added to\n\t\t     the set of matches, but are not to be listed to the user.\n\n\t      -U     If this flag is given, all completions are added to the\n\t\t     set of matches and no matching will be done by the\n\t\t     completion code. Normally this is used in functions that\n\t\t     do the matching themselves.\n\n\t      -O array\n\t\t     If this option is given, the completions are not added to\n\t\t     the set of matches.  Instead, matching is done as usual\n\t\t     and all of the completions that match will be stored in\n\t\t     the array parameter whose name is given as array.\n\n\t      -A array\n\t\t     As the -O option, except that instead of those of the\n\t\t     completions which match being stored in array, the\n\t\t     strings generated internally by the completion code are\n\t\t     stored.  For example, with a match specification of `-M\n\t\t     \"L:|no=\"', a current word of `nof' and completions of\n\t\t     `foo', this option stores the string `nofoo' in the\n\t\t     array, whereas the -O option stores the `foo' originally\n\t\t     given.\n\n\t      -D array\n\t\t     As with -O, the completions are not added to the set of\n\t\t     matches.  Instead, whenever the nth completion does not\n\t\t     match, the nth element of the array is removed.  Elements\n\t\t     for which the corresponding completion matches are\n\t\t     retained.\tThis option can be used more than once to\n\t\t     remove elements from multiple arrays.\n\n\t      -C     This option adds a special match which expands to all\n\t\t     other matches when inserted into the line, even those\n\t\t     that are added after this option is used.\tTogether with\n\t\t     the -d option it is possible to specify a string that\n\t\t     should be displayed in the list for this special match.\n\t\t     If no string is given, it will be shown as a string\n\t\t     containing the strings that would be inserted for the\n\t\t     other matches, truncated to the width of the screen.\n\n\t      -E number\n\t\t     This option adds number empty matches after matching\n\t\t     completions have been added.  An empty match takes up\n\t\t     space in completion listings but will never be inserted\n\t\t     in the line and can't be selected with menu completion or\n\t\t     menu selection.  This makes empty matches only useful to\n\t\t     format completion lists and to make explanatory string be\n\t\t     shown in completion lists (since empty matches can be\n\t\t     given display strings with the -d option).  And because\n\t\t     all but one empty string would otherwise be removed, this\n\t\t     option implies the -V and -2 options (even if an explicit\n\t\t     -J option is given).  This can be important to note as it\n\t\t     affects the name space into which matches are added.\n\n\t      -\n\t      --     This flag ends the list of flags and options. All\n\t\t     arguments after it will be taken as the completions even\n\t\t     if they begin with hyphens.\n\n\t      Except for the -M flag, if any of these flags is given more than\n\t      once, the first one (and its argument) will be used.\n\n       compset -p number\n       compset -P [ number ] pattern\n       compset -s number\n       compset -S [ number ] pattern\n       compset -n begin [ end ]\n       compset -N beg-pat [ end-pat ]\n       compset -q\n\t      This command simplifies modification of the special parameters,\n\t      while its return status allows tests on them to be carried out.\n\n\t      The options are:\n\n\t      -p number\n\t\t     If the value of the PREFIX parameter is at least number\n\t\t     characters long, the first number characters are removed\n\t\t     from it and appended to the contents of the IPREFIX\n\t\t     parameter.\n\n\t      -P [ number ] pattern\n\t\t     If the value of the PREFIX parameter begins with anything\n\t\t     that matches the pattern, the matched portion is removed\n\t\t     from PREFIX and appended to IPREFIX.\n\n\t\t     Without the optional number, the longest match is taken,\n\t\t     but if number is given, anything up to the numberth match\n\t\t     is moved.\tIf the number is negative, the numberth\n\t\t     longest match is moved. For example, if PREFIX contains\n\t\t     the string `a=b=c', then compset -P '*\\=' will move the\n\t\t     string `a=b=' into the IPREFIX parameter, but compset -P\n\t\t     1 '*\\=' will move only the string `a='.\n\n\t      -s number\n\t\t     As -p, but transfer the last number characters from the\n\t\t     value of SUFFIX to the front of the value of ISUFFIX.\n\n\t      -S [ number ] pattern\n\t\t     As -P, but match the last portion of SUFFIX and transfer\n\t\t     the matched portion to the front of the value of ISUFFIX.\n\n\t      -n begin [ end ]\n\t\t     If the current word position as specified by the\n\t\t     parameter CURRENT is greater than or equal to begin,\n\t\t     anything up to the beginth word is removed from the words\n\t\t     array and the value of the parameter CURRENT is\n\t\t     decremented by begin.\n\n\t\t     If the optional end is given, the modification is done\n\t\t     only if the current word position is also less than or\n\t\t     equal to end. In this case, the words from position end\n\t\t     onwards are also removed from the words array.\n\n\t\t     Both begin and end may be negative to count backwards\n\t\t     from the last element of the words array.\n\n\t      -N beg-pat [ end-pat ]\n\t\t     If one of the elements of the words array before the one\n\t\t     at the index given by the value of the parameter CURRENT\n\t\t     matches the pattern beg-pat, all elements up to and\n\t\t     including the matching one are removed from the words\n\t\t     array and the value of CURRENT is changed to point to the\n\t\t     same word in the changed array.\n\n\t\t     If the optional pattern end-pat is also given, and there\n\t\t     is an element in the words array matching this pattern,\n\t\t     the parameters are modified only if the index of this\n\t\t     word is higher than the one given by the CURRENT\n\t\t     parameter (so that the matching word has to be after the\n\t\t     cursor). In this case, the words starting with the one\n\t\t     matching end-pat are also removed from the words array.\n\t\t     If words contains no word matching end-pat, the testing\n\t\t     and modification is performed as if it were not given.\n\n\t      -q     The word currently being completed is split on spaces\n\t\t     into separate words, respecting the usual shell quoting\n\t\t     conventions.  The resulting words are stored in the words\n\t\t     array, and CURRENT, PREFIX, SUFFIX, QIPREFIX, and\n\t\t     QISUFFIX are modified to reflect the word part that is\n\t\t     completed.\n\n\t      In all the above cases the return status is zero if the test\n\t      succeeded and the parameters were modified and non-zero\n\t      otherwise. This allows one to use this builtin in tests such as:\n\n\t\t     if compset -P '*\\='; then ...\n\n\t      This forces anything up to and including the last equal sign to\n\t      be ignored by the completion code.\n\n       compcall [ -TD ]\n\t      This allows the use of completions defined with the compctl\n\t      builtin from within completion widgets.  The list of matches\n\t      will be generated as if one of the non-widget completion\n\t      functions (complete-word, etc.) had been called, except that\n\t      only compctls given for specific commands are used. To force the\n\t      code to try completions defined with the -T option of compctl\n\t      and/or the default completion (whether defined by compctl -D or\n\t      the builtin default) in the appropriate places, the -T and/or -D\n\t      flags can be passed to compcall.\n\n\t      The return status can be used to test if a matching compctl\n\t      definition was found. It is non-zero if a compctl was found and\n\t      zero otherwise.\n\n\t      Note that this builtin is defined by the zsh/compctl module.\n\nCOMPLETION CONDITION CODES\n       The following additional condition codes for use within the [[ ... ]]\n       construct are available in completion widgets.  These work on the\n       special parameters.  All of these tests can also be performed by the\n       compset builtin, but in the case of the condition codes the contents of\n       the special parameters are not modified.\n\n       -prefix [ number ] pattern\n\t      true if the test for the -P option of compset would succeed.\n\n       -suffix [ number ] pattern\n\t      true if the test for the -S option of compset would succeed.\n\n       -after beg-pat\n\t      true if the test of the -N option with only the beg-pat given\n\t      would succeed.\n\n       -between beg-pat end-pat\n\t      true if the test for the -N option with both patterns would\n\t      succeed.\n\nCOMPLETION MATCHING CONTROL\n       When the user invokes completion, the current word on the command line\n       (that is, the word the cursor is currently on) is used to generate a\n       match pattern.  Only those completions that match the pattern are\n       offered to the user as matches.\n\n       The default match pattern is generated from the current word by either\n\n       •      appending a `*' (matching any number of characters in a\n\t      completion) or,\n\n       •      if the shell option COMPLETE_IN_WORD is set, inserting a `*' at\n\t      the cursor position.\n\n       This narrow pattern can be broadened selectively by passing a match\n       specification to the compadd builtin command through its -M option (see\n       `Completion Builtin Commands' above).  A match specification consists\n       of one or more matchers separated by whitespace.  Matchers in a match\n       specification are applied one at a time, from left to right.  Once all\n       matchers have been applied, completions are compared to the final match\n       pattern and non-matching ones are discarded.\n\n       •      Note that the -M option is ignored if the current word contains\n\t      a glob pattern and the shell option GLOB_COMPLETE is set or if\n\t      the pattern_match key of the special associative array compstate\n\t      is set to a non-empty value (see `Completion Special Parameters'\n\t      above).\n\n       •      Users of the completion system (see zshcompsys(1))  should\n\t      generally not use the -M option directly, but rather use the\n\t      matcher-list and matcher styles (see the subsection Standard\n\t      Styles in the documentation for COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\n\t      in zshcompsys(1)).\n\n       Each matcher consists of\n\n       •      a case-sensitive letter\n\n       •      a `:',\n\n       •      one or more patterns separated by pipes (`|'),\n\n       •      an equals sign (`='), and\n\n       •      another pattern.\n\n       The patterns before the `=' are used to match substrings of the current\n       word.  For each matched substring, the corresponding part of the match\n       pattern is broadened with the pattern after the `=', by means of a\n       logical OR.\n\n       Each pattern in a matcher cosists of either\n\n       •      the empty string or\n\n       •      a sequence of\n\n\t      •      literal characters (which may be quoted with a `\\'),\n\n\t      •      question marks (`?'),\n\n\t      •      bracket expressions (`[...]'; see the subsection Glob\n\t\t     Operators in the documentation for GLOB OPERATORS in\n\t\t     zshexpn(1)), and/or\n\n\t      •      brace expressions (see below)."

    Manpage text:

    Note that, although the matching system does not yet handle multibyte
           characters, this is likely to be a future extension.  Hence, using
           `[:upper:]' and `[:lower:]' is recommended over `A-Z' and `a-z'.

           Below are the different forms of matchers supported.  Each uppercase
           form behaves exactly like its lowercase counterpart, but adds an
           additional step after the match pattern has filtered out non-matching
           completions:  Each of a match's substrings that was matched by a
           subpattern from an uppercase matcher is replaced with the corresponding
           substring of the current word.  However, patterns from lowercase
           matchers have higher weight:  If a substring of the current word was
           matched by patterns from both a lowercase and an uppercase matcher,
           then the lowercase matcher's pattern wins and the corresponding part of
           the match is not modified.

           Unless indicated otherwise, each example listed assumes
           COMPLETE_IN_WORD to be unset (as it is by default).
