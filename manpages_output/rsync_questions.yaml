To change the default system-wide, a symlink may be placed\n       at /var/select/rsync with a target of either \"rsync_samba\" for this\n       version of rsync, or \"rsync_openrsync\" for openrsync.  To select a\n       specific implementation for a single invocation of rsync, the\n       CHOSEN_RSYNC environment variable may be set to either \"rsync_samba\" or\n       \"rsync_openrsync\" as with the /var/select symlink.\n\n       rsync is a program that behaves in much the same way that rcp does, but\n       has many more options and uses the rsync remote-update protocol to\n       greatly speed up file transfers when the destination file is being\n       updated.\n\n       The rsync remote-update protocol allows rsync to transfer just the\n       differences between two sets of files across the network connection,\n       using an efficient checksum-search algorithm described in the technical\n       report that accompanies this package.\n\n       Some of the additional features of rsync are:\n\n       o      support for copying links, devices, owners, groups, and\n\t      permissions\n\n       o      exclude and exclude-from options similar to GNU tar\n\n       o      a CVS exclude mode for ignoring the same files that CVS would\n\t      ignore\n\n       o      can use any transparent remote shell, including ssh or rsh\n\n       o      does not require super-user privileges\n\n       o      pipelining of file transfers to minimize latency costs\n\n       o      support for anonymous or authenticated rsync daemons (ideal for\n\t      mirroring)"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `rsync`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nGENERAL\n       Rsync copies files either to or from a remote host, or locally on the\n       current host (it does not support copying files between two remote\n       hosts).\n\n       There are two different ways for rsync to contact a remote system:\n       using a remote-shell program as the transport (such as ssh or rsh) or\n       contacting an rsync daemon directly via TCP.  The remote-shell\n       transport is used whenever the source or destination path contains a\n       single colon (:) separator after a host specification.  Contacting an\n       rsync daemon directly happens when the source or destination path\n       contains a double colon (::) separator after a host specification, OR\n       when an rsync:// URL is specified (see also the \"USING RSYNC-DAEMON\n       FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION\" section for an exception to\n       this latter rule).\n\n       As a special case, if a single source arg is specified without a\n       destination, the files are listed in an output format similar to \"ls\n       -l\".\n\n       As expected, if neither the source or destination path specify a remote\n       host, the copy occurs locally (see also the --list-only option).\n\nSETUP\n       See the file README for installation instructions.\n\n       Once installed, you can use rsync to any machine that you can access\n       via a remote shell (as well as some that you can access using the rsync\n       daemon-mode protocol).  For remote transfers, a modern rsync uses ssh\n       for its communications, but it may have been configured to use a\n       different remote shell by default, such as rsh or remsh.\n\n       You can also specify any remote shell you like, either by using the -e\n       command line option, or by setting the RSYNC_RSH environment variable.\n\n       Note that rsync must be installed on both the source and destination\n       machines.\n\nUSAGE\n       You use rsync in the same way you use rcp. You must specify a source\n       and a destination, one of which may be remote.\n\n       Perhaps the best way to explain the syntax is with some examples:\n\n\t      rsync -t *.c foo:src/"

If any of the files\n       already exist on the remote system then the rsync remote-update\n       protocol is used to update the file by sending only the differences.\n       See the tech report for details.\n\n\t      rsync -avz foo:src/bar /data/tmp\n\n\n       This would recursively transfer all files from the directory src/bar on\n       the machine foo into the /data/tmp/bar directory on the local machine.\n       The files are transferred in \"archive\" mode, which ensures that\n       symbolic links, devices, attributes, permissions, ownerships, etc. are\n       preserved in the transfer.  Additionally, compression will be used to\n       reduce the size of data portions of the transfer.\n\n\t      rsync -avz foo:src/bar/ /data/tmp\n\n\n       A trailing slash on the source changes this behavior to avoid creating\n       an additional directory level at the destination.  You can think of a\n       trailing / on a source as meaning \"copy the contents of this directory\"\n       as opposed to \"copy the directory by name\", but in both cases the\n       attributes of the containing directory are transferred to the\n       containing directory on the destination.  In other words, each of the\n       following commands copies the files in the same way, including their\n       setting of the attributes of /dest/foo:\n\n\t      rsync -av /src/foo /dest\n\t      rsync -av /src/foo/ /dest/foo"

For example, both\n       of these copy the remote directory's contents into \"/dest\":\n\n\t      rsync -av host: /dest\n\t      rsync -av host::module /dest\n\n\n       You can also use rsync in local-only mode, where both the source and\n       destination don't have a ':' in the name. In this case it behaves like\n       an improved copy command.\n\n       Finally, you can list all the (listable) modules available from a\n       particular rsync daemon by leaving off the module name:\n\n\t      rsync somehost.mydomain.com::\n\n\n       See the following section for more details.\n\nADVANCED USAGE\n       The syntax for requesting multiple files from a remote host involves\n       using quoted spaces in the SRC.\tSome examples:\n\n\t      rsync host::'modname/dir1/file1 modname/dir2/file2' /dest\n\n\n       This would copy file1 and file2 into /dest from an rsync daemon.  Each\n       additional arg must include the same \"modname/\" prefix as the first\n       one, and must be preceded by a single space.  All other spaces are\n       assumed to be a part of the filenames.\n\n\t      rsync -av host:'dir1/file1 dir2/file2' /dest"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `rsync`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThis would copy file1 and file2 into /dest using a remote shell.  This\n       word-splitting is done by the remote shell, so if it doesn't work it\n       means that the remote shell isn't configured to split its args based on\n       whitespace (a very rare setting, but not unknown).  If you need to\n       transfer a filename that contains whitespace, you'll need to either\n       escape the whitespace in a way that the remote shell will understand,\n       or use wildcards in place of the spaces.  Two examples of this are:\n\n\t      rsync -av host:'file\\ name\\ with\\ spaces' /dest\n\t      rsync -av host:file?name?with?spaces /dest\n\n\n       This latter example assumes that your shell passes through unmatched\n       wildcards.  If it complains about \"no match\", put the name in quotes.\n\nCONNECTING TO AN RSYNC DAEMON\n       It is also possible to use rsync without a remote shell as the\n       transport.  In this case you will directly connect to a remote rsync\n       daemon, typically using TCP port 873.  (This obviously requires the\n       daemon to be running on the remote system, so refer to the STARTING AN\n       RSYNC DAEMON TO ACCEPT CONNECTIONS section below for information on\n       that.)\n\n       Using rsync in this way is the same as using it with a remote shell\n       except that:\n\n       o      you either use a double colon :: instead of a single colon to\n\t      separate the hostname from the path, or you use an rsync:// URL.\n\n       o      the first word of the \"path\" is actually a module name.\n\n       o      the remote daemon may print a message of the day when you\n\t      connect.\n\n       o      if you specify no path name on the remote daemon then the list\n\t      of accessible paths on the daemon will be shown.\n\n       o      if you specify no local destination then a listing of the\n\t      specified files on the remote daemon is provided.\n\n       o      you must not specify the --rsh (-e) option."

If so,\n       you will receive a password prompt when you connect. You can avoid the\n       password prompt by setting the environment variable RSYNC_PASSWORD to\n       the password you want to use or using the --password-file option. This\n       may be useful when scripting rsync.\n\n       WARNING: On some systems environment variables are visible to all\n       users. On those systems using --password-file is recommended.\n\n       You may establish the connection via a web proxy by setting the\n       environment variable RSYNC_PROXY to a hostname:port pair pointing to\n       your web proxy.\tNote that your web proxy's configuration must support\n       proxy connections to port 873.\n\nUSING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL CONNECTION\n       It is sometimes useful to use various features of an rsync daemon (such\n       as named modules) without actually allowing any new socket connections\n       into a system (other than what is already required to allow remote-\n       shell access).  Rsync supports connecting to a host using a remote\n       shell and then spawning a single-use \"daemon\" server that expects to\n       read its config file in the home dir of the remote user.  This can be\n       useful if you want to encrypt a daemon-style transfer's data, but since\n       the daemon is started up fresh by the remote user, you may not be able\n       to use features such as chroot or change the uid used by the daemon.\n       (For another way to encrypt a daemon transfer, consider using ssh to\n       tunnel a local port to a remote machine and configure a normal rsync\n       daemon on that remote host to only allow connections from \"localhost\".)\n\n       From the user's perspective, a daemon transfer via a remote-shell\n       connection uses nearly the same command-line syntax as a normal rsync-\n       daemon transfer, with the only exception being that you must explicitly\n       set the remote shell program on the command-line with the --rsh=COMMAND\n       option.\t(Setting the RSYNC_RSH in the environment will not turn on\n       this functionality.)  For example:\n\n\t   rsync -av --rsh=ssh host::module /dest"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `rsync`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nRsync can also be run as a daemon, in which case the following options\n       are accepted:\n\n\t    --daemon\t\t    run as an rsync daemon\n\t    --address=ADDRESS\t    bind to the specified address\n\t    --bwlimit=KBPS\t    limit I/O bandwidth; KBytes per second\n\t    --config=FILE\t    specify alternate rsyncd.conf file\n\t    --no-detach \t    do not detach from the parent\n\t    --port=PORT \t    listen on alternate port number\n\t    --log-file=FILE\t    override the \"log file\" setting\n\t    --log-file-format=FMT   override the \"log format\" setting\n\t    --sockopts=OPTIONS\t    specify custom TCP options\n\t-v, --verbose\t\t    increase verbosity\n\t-4, --ipv4\t\t    prefer IPv4\n\t-6, --ipv6\t\t    prefer IPv6\n\t-h, --help\t\t    show this help (if used after --daemon)\n\n\nOPTIONS\n       rsync uses the GNU long options package. Many of the command line\n       options have two variants, one short and one long.  These are shown\n       below, separated by commas. Some options only have a long variant.  The\n       '=' for options that take a parameter is optional; whitespace can be\n       used instead.\n\n       --help Print a short help page describing the options available in\n\t      rsync and exit.  For backward-compatibility with older versions\n\t      of rsync, the help will also be output if you use the -h option\n\t      without any other args.\n\n       --version\n\t      print the rsync version number and exit.\n\n       -v, --verbose\n\t      This option increases the amount of information you are given\n\t      during the transfer.  By default, rsync works silently. A single\n\t      -v will give you information about what files are being\n\t      transferred and a brief summary at the end. Two -v flags will\n\t      give you information on what files are being skipped and\n\t      slightly more information at the end. More than two -v flags\n\t      should only be used if you are debugging rsync.\n\n\t      Note that the names of the transferred files that are output are\n\t      done using a default --out-format of \"%n%L\", which tells you\n\t      just the name of the file and, if the item is a link, where it\n\t      points.  At the single -v level of verbosity, this does not\n\t      mention when a file gets its attributes changed.\tIf you ask for\n\t      an itemized list of changed attributes (either --itemize-changes\n\t      or adding \"%i\" to the --out-format setting), the output (on the\n\t      client) increases to mention all items that are changed in any\n\t      way.  See the --out-format option for more details.\n\n       -q, --quiet\n\t      This option decreases the amount of information you are given\n\t      during the transfer, notably suppressing information messages\n\t      from the remote server. This flag is useful when invoking rsync\n\t      from cron.\n\n       --no-motd\n\t      This option affects the information that is output by the client\n\t      at the start of a daemon transfer.  This suppresses the message-\n\t      of-the-day (MOTD) text, but it also affects the list of modules\n\t      that the daemon sends in response to the \"rsync host::\" request\n\t      (due to a limitation in the rsync protocol), so omit this option\n\t      if you want to request the list of modules from the deamon.\n\n       -I, --ignore-times\n\t      Normally rsync will skip any files that are already the same\n\t      size and have the same modification time-stamp.  This option\n\t      turns off this \"quick check\" behavior, causing all files to be\n\t      updated.\n\n       --size-only\n\t      Normally rsync will not transfer any files that are already the\n\t      same size and have the same modification time-stamp. With the\n\t      --size-only option, files will not be transferred if they have\n\t      the same size, regardless of timestamp. This is useful when\n\t      starting to use rsync after using another mirroring system which\n\t      may not preserve timestamps exactly.\n\n       --modify-window\n\t      When comparing two timestamps, rsync treats the timestamps as\n\t      being equal if they differ by no more than the modify-window\n\t      value.  This is normally 0 (for an exact match), but you may\n\t      find it useful to set this to a larger value in some situations.\n\t      In particular, when transferring to or from an MS Windows FAT\n\t      filesystem (which represents times with a 2-second resolution),\n\t      --modify-window=1 is useful (allowing times to differ by up to 1\n\t      second).\n\n       -c, --checksum\n\t      This forces the sender to checksum every regular file using a\n\t      128-bit MD4 checksum.  It does this during the initial file-\n\t      system scan as it builds the list of all available files. The\n\t      receiver then checksums its version of each file (if it exists\n\t      and it has the same size as its sender-side counterpart) in\n\t      order to decide which files need to be updated: files with\n\t      either a changed size or a changed checksum are selected for\n\t      transfer.  Since this whole-file checksumming of all files on\n\t      both sides of the connection occurs in addition to the automatic\n\t      checksum verifications that occur during a file's transfer, this\n\t      option can be quite slow.\n\n\t      Note that rsync always verifies that each transferred file was\n\t      correctly reconstructed on the receiving side by checking its\n\t      whole-file checksum, but that automatic after-the-transfer\n\t      verification has nothing to do with this option's before-the-\n\t      transfer \"Does this file need to be updated?\" check.\n\n       -a, --archive\n\t      This is equivalent to -rlptgoD. It is a quick way of saying you\n\t      want recursion and want to preserve almost everything (with -H\n\t      being a notable omission).  The only exception to the above\n\t      equivalence is when --files-from is specified, in which case -r\n\t      is not implied.\n\n\t      Note that -a does not preserve hardlinks, because finding\n\t      multiply-linked files is expensive.  You must separately specify\n\t      -H.\n\n       --no-OPTION\n\t      You may turn off one or more implied options by prefixing the\n\t      option name with \"no-\".  Not all options may be prefixed with a\n\t      \"no-\": only options that are implied by other options (e.g.\n\t      --no-D, --no-perms) or have different defaults in various\n\t      circumstances (e.g. --no-whole-file, --no-blocking-io,\n\t      --no-dirs).  You may specify either the short or the long option\n\t      name after the \"no-\" prefix (e.g. --no-R is the same as\n\t      --no-relative).\n\n\t      For example: if you want to use -a (--archive) but don't want -o\n\t      (--owner), instead of converting -a into -rlptgD, you could\n\t      specify -a --no-o (or -a --no-owner).\n\n\t      The order of the options is important:  if you specify --no-r\n\t      -a, the -r option would end up being turned on, the opposite of\n\t      -a --no-r.  Note also that the side-effects of the --files-from\n\t      option are NOT positional, as it affects the default state of\n\t      several options and slightly changes the meaning of -a (see the\n\t      --files-from option for more details).\n\n       -r, --recursive\n\t      This tells rsync to copy directories recursively.  See also\n\t      --dirs (-d).\n\n       -R, --relative\n\t      Use relative paths. This means that the full path names\n\t      specified on the command line are sent to the server rather than\n\t      just the last parts of the filenames. This is particularly\n\t      useful when you want to send several different directories at\n\t      the same time. For example, if you used this command:\n\t\t rsync -av /foo/bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/"

To limit the\n\t      amount of path information that is sent, you have a couple\n\t      options:\t(1) With a modern rsync on the sending side (beginning\n\t      with 2.6.7), you can insert a dot and a slash into the source\n\t      path, like this:\n\t\t rsync -avR /foo/./bar/baz.c remote:/tmp/\n\n\n\t      That would create /tmp/bar/baz.c on the remote machine.  (Note\n\t      that the dot must be followed by a slash, so \"/foo/.\" would not\n\t      be abbreviated.)

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `rsync`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n--no-implied-dirs\n\t      This option affects the default behavior of the --relative\n\t      option.  When it is specified, the attributes of the implied\n\t      directories from the source names are not included in the\n\t      transfer.  This means that the corresponding path elements on\n\t      the destination system are left unchanged if they exist, and any\n\t      missing implied directories are created with default attributes.\n\t      This even allows these implied path elements to have big\n\t      differences, such as being a symlink to a directory on one side\n\t      of the transfer, and a real directory on the other side.\n\n\t      For instance, if a command-line arg or a files-from entry told\n\t      rsync to transfer the file \"path/foo/file\", the directories\n\t      \"path\" and \"path/foo\" are implied when --relative is used.  If\n\t      \"path/foo\" is a symlink to \"bar\" on the destination system, the\n\t      receiving rsync would ordinarily delete \"path/foo\", recreate it\n\t      as a directory, and receive the file into the new directory.\n\t      With --no-implied-dirs, the receiving rsync updates\n\t      \"path/foo/file\" using the existing path elements, which means\n\t      that the file ends up being created in \"path/bar\".  Another way\n\t      to accomplish this link preservation is to use the\n\t      --keep-dirlinks option (which will also affect symlinks to\n\t      directories in the rest of the transfer).\n\n\t      In a similar but opposite scenario, if the transfer of\n\t      \"path/foo/file\" is requested and \"path/foo\" is a symlink on the\n\t      sending side, running without --no-implied-dirs would cause\n\t      rsync to transform \"path/foo\" on the receiving side into an\n\t      identical symlink, and then attempt to transfer \"path/foo/file\",\n\t      which might fail if the duplicated symlink did not point to a\n\t      directory on the receiving side.\tAnother way to avoid this\n\t      sending of a symlink as an implied directory is to use\n\t      --copy-unsafe-links, or --copy-dirlinks (both of which also\n\t      affect symlinks in the rest of the transfer -- see their\n\t      descriptions for full details).\n\n       -b, --backup\n\t      With this option, preexisting destination files are renamed as\n\t      each file is transferred or deleted.  You can control where the\n\t      backup file goes and what (if any) suffix gets appended using\n\t      the --backup-dir and --suffix options.\n\n\t      Note that if you don't specify --backup-dir, (1) the\n\t      --omit-dir-times option will be implied, and (2) if --delete is\n\t      also in effect (without --delete-excluded), rsync will add a\n\t      \"protect\" filter-rule for the backup suffix to the end of all\n\t      your existing excludes (e.g. -f \"P *~\").\tThis will prevent\n\t      previously backed-up files from being deleted.  Note that if you\n\t      are supplying your own filter rules, you may need to manually\n\t      insert your own exclude/protect rule somewhere higher up in the\n\t      list so that it has a high enough priority to be effective\n\t      (e.g., if your rules specify a trailing inclusion/exclusion of\n\t      '*', the auto-added rule would never be reached).\n\n       --backup-dir=DIR\n\t      In combination with the --backup option, this tells rsync to\n\t      store all backups in the specified directory on the receiving\n\t      side.  This can be used for incremental backups.\tYou can\n\t      additionally specify a backup suffix using the --suffix option\n\t      (otherwise the files backed up in the specified directory will\n\t      keep their original filenames).\n\n       --suffix=SUFFIX\n\t      This option allows you to override the default backup suffix\n\t      used with the --backup (-b) option. The default suffix is a ~ if\n\t      no --backup-dir was specified, otherwise it is an empty string.\n\n       -u, --update\n\t      This forces rsync to skip any files which exist on the\n\t      destination and have a modified time that is newer than the\n\t      source file.  (If an existing destination file has a modify time\n\t      equal to the source file's, it will be updated if the sizes are\n\t      different.)\n\n\t      In the current implementation of --update, a difference of file\n\t      format between the sender and receiver is always considered to\n\t      be important enough for an update, no matter what date is on the\n\t      objects.\tIn other words, if the source has a directory or a\n\t      symlink where the destination has a file, the transfer would\n\t      occur regardless of the timestamps.  This might change in the\n\t      future (feel free to comment on this on the mailing list if you\n\t      have an opinion).\n\n       --inplace\n\t      This causes rsync not to create a new copy of the file and then\n\t      move it into place.  Instead rsync will overwrite the existing\n\t      file, meaning that the rsync algorithm can't accomplish the full\n\t      amount of network reduction it might be able to otherwise (since\n\t      it does not yet try to sort data matches).  One exception to\n\t      this is if you combine the option with --backup, since rsync is\n\t      smart enough to use the backup file as the basis file for the\n\t      transfer.\n\n\t      This option is useful for transfer of large files with block-\n\t      based changes or appended data, and also on systems that are\n\t      disk bound, not network bound.\n\n\t      The option implies --partial (since an interrupted transfer does\n\t      not delete the file), but conflicts with --partial-dir and\n\t      --delay-updates.\tPrior to rsync 2.6.4 --inplace was also\n\t      incompatible with --compare-dest and --link-dest.\n\n\t      WARNING: The file's data will be in an inconsistent state during\n\t      the transfer (and possibly afterward if the transfer gets\n\t      interrupted), so you should not use this option to update files\n\t      that are in use.\tAlso note that rsync will be unable to update\n\t      a file in-place that is not writable by the receiving user.\n\n       --append\n\t      This causes rsync to update a file by appending data onto the\n\t      end of the file, which presumes that the data that already\n\t      exists on the receiving side is identical with the start of the\n\t      file on the sending side.  If that is not true, the file will\n\t      fail the checksum test, and the resend will do a normal\n\t      --inplace update to correct the mismatched data.\tOnly files on\n\t      the receiving side that are shorter than the corresponding file\n\t      on the sending side (as well as new files) are sent.  Implies\n\t      --inplace, but does not conflict with --sparse (though the\n\t      --sparse option will be auto-disabled if a resend of the\n\t      already-existing data is required).\n\n       -d, --dirs\n\t      Tell the sending side to include any directories that are\n\t      encountered.  Unlike --recursive, a directory's contents are not\n\t      copied unless the directory name specified is \".\" or ends with a\n\t      trailing slash (e.g. \".\", \"dir/.\", \"dir/\", etc.).  Without this\n\t      option or the --recursive option, rsync will skip all\n\t      directories it encounters (and output a message to that effect\n\t      for each one).  If you specify both --dirs and --recursive,\n\t      --recursive takes precedence.\n\n       -l, --links\n\t      When symlinks are encountered, recreate the symlink on the\n\t      destination.\n\n       -L, --copy-links\n\t      When symlinks are encountered, the item that they point to (the\n\t      referent) is copied, rather than the symlink.  In older versions\n\t      of rsync, this option also had the side-effect of telling the\n\t      receiving side to follow symlinks, such as symlinks to\n\t      directories.  In a modern rsync such as this one, you'll need to\n\t      specify --keep-dirlinks (-K) to get this extra behavior.\tThe\n\t      only exception is when sending files to an rsync that is too old\n\t      to understand -K -- in that case, the -L option will still have\n\t      the side-effect of -K on that older receiving rsync.\n\n       --copy-unsafe-links\n\t      This tells rsync to copy the referent of symbolic links that\n\t      point outside the copied tree.  Absolute symlinks are also\n\t      treated like ordinary files, and so are any symlinks in the\n\t      source path itself when --relative is used.  This option has no\n\t      additional effect if --copy-links was also specified.\n\n       --safe-links\n\t      This tells rsync to ignore any symbolic links which point\n\t      outside the copied tree. All absolute symlinks are also ignored.\n\t      Using this option in conjunction with --relative may give\n\t      unexpected results.\n\n       -K, --copy-dirlinks\n\t      This option causes the sending side to treat a symlink to a\n\t      directory as though it were a real directory.  This is useful if\n\t      you don't want symlinks to non-directories to be affected, as\n\t      they would be using --copy-links.\n\n\t      Without this option, if the sending side has replaced a\n\t      directory with a symlink to a directory, the receiving side will\n\t      delete anything that is in the way of the new symlink, including\n\t      a directory hierarchy (as long as --force or --delete is in\n\t      effect).\n\n\t      See also --keep-dirlinks for an analogous option for the\n\t      receiving side.\n\n       -K, --keep-dirlinks\n\t      This option causes the receiving side to treat a symlink to a\n\t      directory as though it were a real directory, but only if it\n\t      matches a real directory from the sender.  Without this option,\n\t      the receiver's symlink would be deleted and replaced with a real\n\t      directory.\n\n\t      For example, suppose you transfer a directory \"foo\" that\n\t      contains a file \"file\", but \"foo\" is a symlink to directory\n\t      \"bar\" on the receiver.  Without --keep-dirlinks, the receiver\n\t      deletes symlink \"foo\", recreates it as a directory, and receives\n\t      the file into the new directory.\tWith --keep-dirlinks, the\n\t      receiver keeps the symlink and \"file\" ends up in \"bar\".\n\n\t      See also --copy-dirlinks for an analogous option for the sending\n\t      side.\n\n       -H, --hard-links\n\t      This tells rsync to look for hard-linked files in the transfer\n\t      and link together the corresponding files on the receiving side.\n\t      Without this option, hard-linked files in the transfer are\n\t      treated as though they were separate files.\n\n\t      Note that rsync can only detect hard links if both parts of the\n\t      link are in the list of files being sent.\n\n       -p, --perms\n\t      This option causes the receiving rsync to set the destination\n\t      permissions to be the same as the source permissions.  (See also\n\t      the --chmod option for a way to modify what rsync considers to\n\t      be the source permissions.)\n\n\t      When this option is off, permissions are set as follows:\n\n\t      o      Existing files (including updated files) retain their\n\t\t     existing permissions, though the --executability option\n\t\t     might change just the execute permission for the file.\n\n\t      o      New files get their \"normal\" permission bits set to the\n\t\t     source file's permissions masked with the receiving end's\n\t\t     umask setting, and their special permission bits disabled\n\t\t     except in the case where a new directory inherits a\n\t\t     setgid bit from its parent directory."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `rsync`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThus, when --perms and --executability are both disabled,\n\t      rsync's behavior is the same as that of other file-copy\n\t      utilities, such as cp(1) and tar(1).\n\n\t      In summary: to give destination files (both old and new) the\n\t      source permissions, use --perms.\tTo give new files the\n\t      destination-default permissions (while leaving existing files\n\t      unchanged), make sure that the --perms option is off and use\n\t      --chmod=ugo=rwX (which ensures that all non-masked bits get\n\t      enabled).  If you'd care to make this latter behavior easier to\n\t      type, you could define a popt alias for it, such as putting this\n\t      line in the file ~/.popt (this defines the -s option, and\n\t      includes --no-g to use the default group of the destination\n\t      dir):\n\t\t rsync alias -s --no-p --no-g --chmod=ugo=rwX\n\n\n\t      You could then use this new option in a command such as this\n\t      one:\n\t\t rsync -asv src/ dest/\n\n\n\t      (Caveat: make sure that -a does not follow -s, or it will re-\n\t      enable the \"--no-*\" options.)\n\n\t      The preservation of the destination's setgid bit on newly-\n\t      created directories when --perms is off was added in rsync\n\t      2.6.7.  Older rsync versions erroneously preserved the three\n\t      special permission bits for newly-created files when --perms was\n\t      off, while overriding the destination's setgid bit setting on a\n\t      newly-created directory.\t(Keep in mind that it is the version\n\t      of the receiving rsync that affects this behavior.)\n\n       --executability\n\t      This option causes rsync to preserve the executability (or non-\n\t      executability) of regular files when --perms is not enabled.  A\n\t      regular file is considered to be executable if at least one 'x'\n\t      is turned on in its permissions.\tWhen an existing destination\n\t      file's executability differs from that of the corresponding\n\t      source file, rsync modifies the destination file's permissions\n\t      as follows:\n\n\t      o      To make a file non-executable, rsync turns off all its\n\t\t     'x' permissions.\n\n\t      o      To make a file executable, rsync turns on each 'x'\n\t\t     permission that has a corresponding 'r' permission\n\t\t     enabled."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `rsync`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIf --perms is enabled, this option is ignored.\n\n       --chmod\n\t      This option tells rsync to apply one or more comma-separated\n\t      \"chmod\" strings to the permission of the files in the transfer.\n\t      The resulting value is treated as though it was the permissions\n\t      that the sending side supplied for the file, which means that\n\t      this option can seem to have no effect on existing files if\n\t      --perms is not enabled.\n\n\t      In addition to the normal parsing rules specified in the\n\t      chmod(1) manpage, you can specify an item that should only apply\n\t      to a directory by prefixing it with a 'D', or specify an item\n\t      that should only apply to a file by prefixing it with a 'F'.\n\t      For example:\n\t      --chmod=Dg+s,ug+w,Fo-w,+X\n\n\n\t      It is also legal to specify multiple --chmod options, as each\n\t      additional option is just appended to the list of changes to\n\t      make.\n\n\t      See the --perms and --executability options for how the\n\t      resulting permission value can be applied to the files in the\n\t      transfer.\n\n       -o, --owner\n\t      This option causes rsync to set the owner of the destination\n\t      file to be the same as the source file, but only if the\n\t      receiving rsync is being run as the super-user (see also the\n\t      --super option to force rsync to attempt super-user activities).\n\t      Without this option, the owner is set to the invoking user on\n\t      the receiving side.\n\n\t      The preservation of ownership will associate matching names by\n\t      default, but may fall back to using the ID number in some\n\t      circumstances (see also the --numeric-ids option for a full\n\t      discussion).\n\n       -g, --group\n\t      This option causes rsync to set the group of the destination\n\t      file to be the same as the source file.  If the receiving\n\t      program is not running as the super-user (or if --no-super was\n\t      specified), only groups that the invoking user on the receiving\n\t      side is a member of will be preserved.  Without this option, the\n\t      group is set to the default group of the invoking user on the\n\t      receiving side.\n\n\t      The preservation of group information will associate matching\n\t      names by default, but may fall back to using the ID number in\n\t      some circumstances (see also the --numeric-ids option for a full\n\t      discussion).\n\n       --devices\n\t      This option causes rsync to transfer character and block device\n\t      files to the remote system to recreate these devices.  This\n\t      option has no effect if the receiving rsync is not run as the\n\t      super-user and --super is not specified.\n\n       --specials\n\t      This option causes rsync to transfer special files such as named\n\t      sockets and fifos.\n\n       -D     The -D option is equivalent to --devices --specials.\n\n       -t, --times\n\t      This tells rsync to transfer modification times along with the\n\t      files and update them on the remote system.  Note that if this\n\t      option is not used, the optimization that excludes files that\n\t      have not been modified cannot be effective; in other words, a\n\t      missing -t or -a will cause the next transfer to behave as if it\n\t      used -I, causing all files to be updated (though the rsync\n\t      algorithm will make the update fairly efficient if the files\n\t      haven't actually changed, you're much better off using -t).\n\n       -O, --omit-dir-times\n\t      This tells rsync to omit directories when it is preserving\n\t      modification times (see --times).  If NFS is sharing the\n\t      directories on the receiving side, it is a good idea to use -O.\n\t      This option is inferred if you use --backup without\n\t      --backup-dir.\n\n       --super\n\t      This tells the receiving side to attempt super-user activities\n\t      even if the receiving rsync wasn't run by the super-user.  These\n\t      activities include: preserving users via the --owner option,\n\t      preserving all groups (not just the current user's groups) via\n\t      the --groups option, and copying devices via the --devices\n\t      option.  This is useful for systems that allow such activities\n\t      without being the super-user, and also for ensuring that you\n\t      will get errors if the receiving side isn't being running as the\n\t      super-user.  To turn off super-user activities, the super-user\n\t      can use --no-super.\n\n       -S, --sparse\n\t      Try to handle sparse files efficiently so they take up less\n\t      space on the destination.  Conflicts with --inplace because it's\n\t      not possible to overwrite data in a sparse fashion.\n\n\t      NOTE: Don't use this option when the destination is a Solaris\n\t      \"tmpfs\" filesystem. It doesn't seem to handle seeks over null\n\t      regions correctly and ends up corrupting the files.\n\n       -n, --dry-run\n\t      This tells rsync to not do any file transfers, instead it will\n\t      just report the actions it would have taken.\n\n       -W, --whole-file\n\t      With this option the incremental rsync algorithm is not used and\n\t      the whole file is sent as-is instead.  The transfer may be\n\t      faster if this option is used when the bandwidth between the\n\t      source and destination machines is higher than the bandwidth to\n\t      disk (especially when the \"disk\" is actually a networked\n\t      filesystem).  This is the default when both the source and\n\t      destination are specified as local paths.\n\n       -x, --one-file-system\n\t      This tells rsync to avoid crossing a filesystem boundary when\n\t      recursing.  This does not limit the user's ability to specify\n\t      items to copy from multiple filesystems, just rsync's recursion\n\t      through the hierarchy of each directory that the user specified,\n\t      and also the analogous recursion on the receiving side during\n\t      deletion.  Also keep in mind that rsync treats a \"bind\" mount to\n\t      the same device as being on the same filesystem.\n\n\t      If this option is repeated, rsync omits all mount-point\n\t      directories from the copy.  Otherwise, it includes an empty\n\t      directory at each mount-point it encounters (using the\n\t      attributes of the mounted directory because those of the\n\t      underlying mount-point directory are inaccessible).\n\n\t      If rsync has been told to collapse symlinks (via --copy-links or\n\t      --copy-unsafe-links), a symlink to a directory on another device\n\t      is treated like a mount-point.  Symlinks to non-directories are\n\t      unaffected by this option.\n\n       --existing, --ignore-non-existing\n\t      This tells rsync to skip creating files (including directories)\n\t      that do not exist yet on the destination.  If this option is\n\t      combined with the --ignore-existing option, no files will be\n\t      updated (which can be useful if all you want to do is to delete\n\t      extraneous files).\n\n       --ignore-existing\n\t      This tells rsync to skip updating files that already exist on\n\t      the destination (this does not ignore existing directores, or\n\t      nothing would get done).\tSee also --existing.\n\n       --remove-source-files\n\t      This tells rsync to remove from the sending side the files\n\t      (meaning non-directories) that are a part of the transfer and\n\t      have been successfully duplicated on the receiving side.\n\n       --delete\n\t      This tells rsync to delete extraneous files from the receiving\n\t      side (ones that aren't on the sending side), but only for the\n\t      directories that are being synchronized.\tYou must have asked\n\t      rsync to send the whole directory (e.g. \"dir\" or \"dir/\") without\n\t      using a wildcard for the directory's contents (e.g. \"dir/*\")\n\t      since the wildcard is expanded by the shell and rsync thus gets\n\t      a request to transfer individual files, not the files' parent\n\t      directory.  Files that are excluded from transfer are also\n\t      excluded from being deleted unless you use the --delete-excluded\n\t      option or mark the rules as only matching on the sending side\n\t      (see the include/exclude modifiers in the FILTER RULES section).\n\n\t      Prior to rsync 2.6.7, this option would have no effect unless\n\t      --recursive was in effect.  Beginning with 2.6.7, deletions will\n\t      also occur when --dirs (-d) is in effect, but only for\n\t      directories whose contents are being copied.\n\n\t      This option can be dangerous if used incorrectly!  It is a very\n\t      good idea to run first using the --dry-run option (-n) to see\n\t      what files would be deleted to make sure important files aren't\n\t      listed.\n\n\t      If the sending side detects any I/O errors, then the deletion of\n\t      any files at the destination will be automatically disabled.\n\t      This is to prevent temporary filesystem failures (such as NFS\n\t      errors) on the sending side causing a massive deletion of files\n\t      on the destination.  You can override this with the\n\t      --ignore-errors option.\n\n\t      The --delete option may be combined with one of the\n\t      --delete-WHEN options without conflict, as well as\n\t      --delete-excluded.  However, if none of the --delete-WHEN\n\t      options are specified, rsync will currently choose the\n\t      --delete-before algorithm.  A future version may change this to\n\t      choose the --delete-during algorithm.  See also --delete-after.\n\n       --delete-before\n\t      Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be done\n\t      before the transfer starts.  This is the default if --delete or\n\t      --delete-excluded is specified without one of the --delete-WHEN\n\t      options.\tSee --delete (which is implied) for more details on\n\t      file-deletion.\n\n\t      Deleting before the transfer is helpful if the filesystem is\n\t      tight for space and removing extraneous files would help to make\n\t      the transfer possible.  However, it does introduce a delay\n\t      before the start of the transfer, and this delay might cause the\n\t      transfer to timeout (if --timeout was specified).\n\n       --delete-during, --del\n\t      Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be done\n\t      incrementally as the transfer happens.  This is a faster method\n\t      than choosing the before- or after-transfer algorithm, but it is\n\t      only supported beginning with rsync version 2.6.4.  See --delete\n\t      (which is implied) for more details on file-deletion.\n\n       --delete-after\n\t      Request that the file-deletions on the receiving side be done\n\t      after the transfer has completed.  This is useful if you are\n\t      sending new per-directory merge files as a part of the transfer\n\t      and you want their exclusions to take effect for the delete\n\t      phase of the current transfer.  See --delete (which is implied)\n\t      for more details on file-deletion.\n\n       --delete-excluded\n\t      In addition to deleting the files on the receiving side that are\n\t      not on the sending side, this tells rsync to also delete any\n\t      files on the receiving side that are excluded (see --exclude).\n\t      See the FILTER RULES section for a way to make individual\n\t      exclusions behave this way on the receiver, and for a way to\n\t      protect files from --delete-excluded.  See --delete (which is\n\t      implied) for more details on file-deletion.\n\n       --ignore-errors\n\t      Tells --delete to go ahead and delete files even when there are\n\t      I/O errors.\n\n       --force\n\t      This option tells rsync to delete a non-empty directory when it\n\t      is to be replaced by a non-directory.  This is only relevant if\n\t      deletions are not active (see --delete for details).\n\n\t      Note for older rsync versions: --force used to still be required\n\t      when using --delete-after, and it used to be non-functional\n\t      unless the --recursive option was also enabled.\n\n       --max-delete=NUM\n\t      This tells rsync not to delete more than NUM files or\n\t      directories (NUM must be non-zero).  This is useful when\n\t      mirroring very large trees to prevent disasters.\n\n       --max-size=SIZE\n\t      This tells rsync to avoid transferring any file that is larger\n\t      than the specified SIZE. The SIZE value can be suffixed with a\n\t      string to indicate a size multiplier, and may be a fractional\n\t      value (e.g. \"--max-size=1.5m\").\n\n\t      The suffixes are as follows: \"K\" (or \"KiB\") is a kibibyte\n\t      (1024), \"M\" (or \"MiB\") is a mebibyte (1024*1024), and \"G\" (or\n\t      \"GiB\") is a gibibyte (1024*1024*1024).  If you want the\n\t      multiplier to be 1000 instead of 1024, use \"KB\", \"MB\", or \"GB\".\n\t      (Note: lower-case is also accepted for all values.) Finally, if\n\t      the suffix ends in either \"+1\" or \"-1\", the value will be offset\n\t      by one byte in the indicated direction.\n\n\t      Examples: --max-size=1.5mb-1 is 1499999 bytes, and\n\t      --max-size=2g+1 is 2147483649 bytes.\n\n       --min-size=SIZE\n\t      This tells rsync to avoid transferring any file that is smaller\n\t      than the specified SIZE, which can help in not transferring\n\t      small, junk files.  See the --max-size option for a description\n\t      of SIZE.\n\n       -B, --block-size=BLOCKSIZE\n\t      This forces the block size used in the rsync algorithm to a\n\t      fixed value.  It is normally selected based on the size of each\n\t      file being updated.  See the technical report for details.\n\n       -e, --rsh=COMMAND\n\t      This option allows you to choose an alternative remote shell\n\t      program to use for communication between the local and remote\n\t      copies of rsync. Typically, rsync is configured to use ssh by\n\t      default, but you may prefer to use rsh on a local network.\n\n\t      If this option is used with [user@]host::module/path, then the\n\t      remote shell COMMAND will be used to run an rsync daemon on the\n\t      remote host, and all data will be transmitted through that\n\t      remote shell connection, rather than through a direct socket\n\t      connection to a running rsync daemon on the remote host.\tSee\n\t      the section \"USING RSYNC-DAEMON FEATURES VIA A REMOTE-SHELL\n\t      CONNECTION\" above.\n\n\t      Command-line arguments are permitted in COMMAND provided that\n\t      COMMAND is presented to rsync as a single argument.  You must\n\t      use spaces (not tabs or other whitespace) to separate the\n\t      command and args from each other, and you can use single- and/or\n\t      double-quotes to preserve spaces in an argument (but not\n\t      backslashes).  Note that doubling a single-quote inside a\n\t      single-quoted string gives you a single-quote; likewise for\n\t      double-quotes (though you need to pay attention to which quotes\n\t      your shell is parsing and which quotes rsync is parsing).  Some\n\t      examples:\n\t\t  -e 'ssh -p 2234'\n\t\t  -e 'ssh -o \"ProxyCommand nohup ssh firewall nc -w1 %h %p\"'"

See the cvs(1) manual for more information.\n\n\t      If you're combining -C with your own --filter rules, you should\n\t      note that these CVS excludes are appended at the end of your own\n\t      rules, regardless of where the -C was placed on the command-\n\t      line.  This makes them a lower priority than any rules you\n\t      specified explicitly.  If you want to control where these CVS\n\t      excludes get inserted into your filter rules, you should omit\n\t      the -C as a command-line option and use a combination of\n\t      --filter=:C and --filter=-C (either on your command-line or by\n\t      putting the \":C\" and \"-C\" rules into a filter file with your\n\t      other rules).

In both cases, if the -r option was enabled,\n\t      that dir's entire hierarchy would also be transferred (keep in\n\t      mind that -r needs to be specified explicitly with --files-from,\n\t      since it is not implied by -a).

This affects --exclude-from, --include-from,\n\t      --files-from, and any merged files specified in a --filter rule.\n\t      It does not affect --cvs-exclude (since all names read from a\n\t      .cvsignore file are split on whitespace).\n\n       -T, --temp-dir=DIR\n\t      This option instructs rsync to use DIR as a scratch directory\n\t      when creating temporary copies of the files transferred on the\n\t      receiving side.  The default behavior is to create each\n\t      temporary file in the same directory as the associated\n\t      destination file.\n\n\t      This option is most often used when the receiving disk partition\n\t      does not have enough free space to hold a copy of the largest\n\t      file in the transfer.  In this case (i.e. when the scratch\n\t      directory in on a different disk partition), rsync will not be\n\t      able to rename each received temporary file over the top of the\n\t      associated destination file, but instead must copy it into\n\t      place.  Rsync does this by copying the file over the top of the\n\t      destination file, which means that the destination file will\n\t      contain truncated data during this copy.\tIf this were not done\n\t      this way (even if the destination file were first removed, the\n\t      data locally copied to a temporary file in the destination\n\t      directory, and then renamed into place) it would be possible for\n\t      the old file to continue taking up disk space (if someone had it\n\t      open), and thus there might not be enough room to fit the new\n\t      version on the disk at the same time.\n\n\t      If you are using this option for reasons other than a shortage\n\t      of disk space, you may wish to combine it with the\n\t      --delay-updates option, which will ensure that all copied files\n\t      get put into subdirectories in the destination hierarchy,\n\t      awaiting the end of the transfer.  If you don't have enough room\n\t      to duplicate all the arriving files on the destination\n\t      partition, another way to tell rsync that you aren't overly\n\t      concerned about disk space is to use the --partial-dir option\n\t      with a relative path; because this tells rsync that it is OK to\n\t      stash off a copy of a single file in a subdir in the destination\n\t      hierarchy, rsync will use the partial-dir as a staging area to\n\t      bring over the copied file, and then rename it into place from\n\t      there. (Specifying a --partial-dir with an absolute path does\n\t      not have this side-effect.)\n\n       -y, --fuzzy\n\t      This option tells rsync that it should look for a basis file for\n\t      any destination file that is missing.  The current algorithm\n\t      looks in the same directory as the destination file for either a\n\t      file that has an identical size and modified-time, or a\n\t      similarly-named file.  If found, rsync uses the fuzzy basis file\n\t      to try to speed up the transfer.\n\n\t      Note that the use of the --delete option might get rid of any\n\t      potential fuzzy-match files, so either use --delete-after or\n\t      specify some filename exclusions if you need to prevent this.\n\n       --compare-dest=DIR\n\t      This option instructs rsync to use DIR on the destination\n\t      machine as an additional hierarchy to compare destination files\n\t      against doing transfers (if the files are missing in the\n\t      destination directory).  If a file is found in DIR that is\n\t      identical to the sender's file, the file will NOT be transferred\n\t      to the destination directory.  This is useful for creating a\n\t      sparse backup of just files that have changed from an earlier\n\t      backup.\n\n\t      Beginning in version 2.6.4, multiple --compare-dest directories\n\t      may be provided, which will cause rsync to search the list in\n\t      the order specified for an exact match.  If a match is found\n\t      that differs only in attributes, a local copy is made and the\n\t      attributes updated.  If a match is not found, a basis file from\n\t      one of the DIRs will be selected to try to speed up the\n\t      transfer.\n\n\t      If DIR is a relative path, it is relative to the destination\n\t      directory.  See also --copy-dest and --link-dest.\n\n       --copy-dest=DIR\n\t      This option behaves like --compare-dest, but rsync will also\n\t      copy unchanged files found in DIR to the destination directory\n\t      using a local copy.  This is useful for doing transfers to a new\n\t      destination while leaving existing files intact, and then doing\n\t      a flash-cutover when all files have been successfully\n\t      transferred.\n\n\t      Multiple --copy-dest directories may be provided, which will\n\t      cause rsync to search the list in the order specified for an\n\t      unchanged file.  If a match is not found, a basis file from one\n\t      of the DIRs will be selected to try to speed up the transfer.\n\n\t      If DIR is a relative path, it is relative to the destination\n\t      directory.  See also --compare-dest and --link-dest.\n\n       --link-dest=DIR\n\t      This option behaves like --copy-dest, but unchanged files are\n\t      hard linked from DIR to the destination directory.  The files\n\t      must be identical in all preserved attributes (e.g. permissions,\n\t      possibly ownership) in order for the files to be linked\n\t      together.

See also --compare-dest and --copy-dest.\n\n\t      Note that rsync versions prior to 2.6.1 had a bug that could\n\t      prevent --link-dest from working properly for a non-super-user\n\t      when -o was specified (or implied by -a).  You can work-around\n\t      this bug by avoiding the -o option when sending to an old rsync.\n\n       -z, --compress\n\t      With this option, rsync compresses the file data as it is sent\n\t      to the destination machine, which reduces the amount of data\n\t      being transmitted -- something that is useful over a slow\n\t      connection.\n\n\t      Note that this option typically achieves better compression\n\t      ratios than can be achieved by using a compressing remote shell\n\t      or a compressing transport because it takes advantage of the\n\t      implicit information in the matching data blocks that are not\n\t      explicitly sent over the connection.\n\n       --compress-level=NUM\n\t      Explicitly set the compression level to use (see --compress)\n\t      instead of letting it default.  If NUM is non-zero, the\n\t      --compress option is implied.\n\n       --numeric-ids\n\t      With this option rsync will transfer numeric group and user IDs\n\t      rather than using user and group names and mapping them at both\n\t      ends.\n\n\t      By default rsync will use the username and groupname to\n\t      determine what ownership to give files. The special uid 0 and\n\t      the special group 0 are never mapped via user/group names even\n\t      if the --numeric-ids option is not specified.\n\n\t      If a user or group has no name on the source system or it has no\n\t      match on the destination system, then the numeric ID from the\n\t      source system is used instead.  See also the comments on the\n\t      \"use chroot\" setting in the rsyncd.conf manpage for information\n\t      on how the chroot setting affects rsync's ability to look up the\n\t      names of the users and groups and what you can do about it.\n\n       --timeout=TIMEOUT\n\t      This option allows you to set a maximum I/O timeout in seconds.\n\t      If no data is transferred for the specified time then rsync will\n\t      exit. The default is 0, which means no timeout.\n\n       --address\n\t      By default rsync will bind to the wildcard address when\n\t      connecting to an rsync daemon.  The --address option allows you\n\t      to specify a specific IP address (or hostname) to bind to.  See\n\t      also this option in the --daemon mode section.\n\n       --port=PORT\n\t      This specifies an alternate TCP port number to use rather than\n\t      the default of 873.  This is only needed if you are using the\n\t      double-colon (::) syntax to connect with an rsync daemon (since\n\t      the URL syntax has a way to specify the port as a part of the\n\t      URL).  See also this option in the --daemon mode section.\n\n       --sockopts\n\t      This option can provide endless fun for people who like to tune\n\t      their systems to the utmost degree. You can set all sorts of\n\t      socket options which may make transfers faster (or slower!).\n\t      Read the man page for the setsockopt() system call for details\n\t      on some of the options you may be able to set. By default no\n\t      special socket options are set. This only affects direct socket\n\t      connections to a remote rsync daemon.  This option also exists\n\t      in the --daemon mode section.\n\n       --blocking-io\n\t      This tells rsync to use blocking I/O when launching a remote\n\t      shell transport.\tIf the remote shell is either rsh or remsh,\n\t      rsync defaults to using blocking I/O, otherwise it defaults to\n\t      using non-blocking I/O.  (Note that ssh prefers non-blocking\n\t      I/O.)\n\n       -i, --itemize-changes\n\t      Requests a simple itemized list of the changes that are being\n\t      made to each file, including attribute changes.  This is exactly\n\t      the same as specifying --out-format='%i %n%L'.  If you repeat\n\t      the option, unchanged files will also be output, but only if the\n\t      receiving rsync is at least version 2.6.7 (you can use -vv with\n\t      older versions of rsync, but that also turns on the output of\n\t      other verbose messages).\n\n\t      The \"%i\" escape has a cryptic output that is 9 letters long.\n\t      The general format is like the string YXcstpogz, where Y is\n\t      replaced by the type of update being done, X is replaced by the\n\t      file-type, and the other letters represent attributes that may\n\t      be output if they are being modified.\n\n\t      The update types that replace the Y are as follows:\n\n\t      o      A < means that a file is being transferred to the remote\n\t\t     host (sent).\n\n\t      o      A > means that a file is being transferred to the local\n\t\t     host (received).\n\n\t      o      A c means that a local change/creation is occurring for\n\t\t     the item (such as the creation of a directory or the\n\t\t     changing of a symlink, etc.).\n\n\t      o      A h means that the item is a hard link to another item\n\t\t     (requires --hard-links).\n\n\t      o      A . means that the item is not being updated (though it\n\t\t     might have attributes that are being modified)."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `rsync`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThis is very useful if you need to debug why a connection is\n\t      closing unexpectedly.\n\n       --log-file-format=FORMAT\n\t      This allows you to specify exactly what per-update logging is\n\t      put into the file specified by the --log-file option (which must\n\t      also be specified for this option to have any effect).  If you\n\t      specify an empty string, updated files will not be mentioned in\n\t      the log file.  For a list of the possible escape characters, see\n\t      the \"log format\" setting in the rsyncd.conf manpage.\n\n       --stats\n\t      This tells rsync to print a verbose set of statistics on the\n\t      file transfer, allowing you to tell how effective the rsync\n\t      algorithm is for your data.\n\n\t      The current statistics are as follows:\n\n\t      o      Number of files is the count of all \"files\" (in the\n\t\t     generic sense), which includes directories, symlinks,\n\t\t     etc.\n\n\t      o      Number of files transferred is the count of normal files\n\t\t     that were updated via the rsync algorithm, which does not\n\t\t     include created dirs, symlinks, etc.\n\n\t      o      Total file size is the total sum of all file sizes in the\n\t\t     transfer.\tThis does not count any size for directories\n\t\t     or special files, but does include the size of symlinks.\n\n\t      o      Total transferred file size is the total sum of all files\n\t\t     sizes for just the transferred files.\n\n\t      o      Literal data is how much unmatched file-update data we\n\t\t     had to send to the receiver for it to recreate the\n\t\t     updated files.\n\n\t      o      Matched data is how much data the receiver got locally\n\t\t     when recreating the updated files.\n\n\t      o      File list size is how big the file-list data was when the\n\t\t     sender sent it to the receiver.  This is smaller than the\n\t\t     in-memory size for the file list due to some compressing\n\t\t     of duplicated data when rsync sends the list.\n\n\t      o      File list generation time is the number of seconds that\n\t\t     the sender spent creating the file list.  This requires a\n\t\t     modern rsync on the sending side for this to be present.\n\n\t      o      File list transfer time is the number of seconds that the\n\t\t     sender spent sending the file list to the receiver.\n\n\t      o      Total bytes sent is the count of all the bytes that rsync\n\t\t     sent from the client side to the server side.\n\n\t      o      Total bytes received is the count of all non-message\n\t\t     bytes that rsync received by the client side from the\n\t\t     server side.  \"Non-message\" bytes means that we don't\n\t\t     count the bytes for a verbose message that the server\n\t\t     sent to us, which makes the stats more consistent."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `rsync`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-8, --8-bit-output\n\t      This tells rsync to leave all high-bit characters unescaped in\n\t      the output instead of trying to test them to see if they're\n\t      valid in the current locale and escaping the invalid ones.  All\n\t      control characters (but never tabs) are always escaped,\n\t      regardless of this option's setting.\n\n\t      The escape idiom that started in 2.6.7 is to output a literal\n\t      backslash (\\) and a hash (#), followed by exactly 3 octal\n\t      digits.  For example, a newline would output as \"\\#012\".\tA\n\t      literal backslash that is in a filename is not escaped unless it\n\t      is followed by a hash and 3 digits (0-9).\n\n       -h, --human-readable\n\t      Output numbers in a more human-readable format.  This makes big\n\t      numbers output using larger units, with a K, M, or G suffix.  If\n\t      this option was specified once, these units are K (1000), M\n\t      (1000*1000), and G (1000*1000*1000); if the option is repeated,\n\t      the units are powers of 1024 instead of 1000.\n\n       --partial\n\t      By default, rsync will delete any partially transferred file if\n\t      the transfer is interrupted. In some circumstances it is more\n\t      desirable to keep partially transferred files. Using the\n\t      --partial option tells rsync to keep the partial file which\n\t      should make a subsequent transfer of the rest of the file much\n\t      faster.\n\n       --partial-dir=DIR\n\t      A better way to keep partial files than the --partial option is\n\t      to specify a DIR that will be used to hold the partial data\n\t      (instead of writing it out to the destination file).  On the\n\t      next transfer, rsync will use a file found in this dir as data\n\t      to speed up the resumption of the transfer and then delete it\n\t      after it has served its purpose.\n\n\t      Note that if --whole-file is specified (or implied), any\n\t      partial-dir file that is found for a file that is being updated\n\t      will simply be removed (since rsync is sending files without\n\t      using the incremental rsync algorithm).\n\n\t      Rsync will create the DIR if it is missing (just the last dir --\n\t      not the whole path).  This makes it easy to use a relative path\n\t      (such as \"--partial-dir=.rsync-partial\") to have rsync create\n\t      the partial-directory in the destination file's directory when\n\t      needed, and then remove it again when the partial file is\n\t      deleted.\n\n\t      If the partial-dir value is not an absolute path, rsync will add\n\t      an exclude rule at the end of all your existing excludes.  This\n\t      will prevent the sending of any partial-dir files that may exist\n\t      on the sending side, and will also prevent the untimely deletion\n\t      of partial-dir items on the receiving side.  An example: the\n\t      above --partial-dir option would add the equivalent of\n\t      \"--exclude=.rsync-partial/\" at the end of any other filter\n\t      rules.\n\n\t      If you are supplying your own exclude rules, you may need to add\n\t      your own exclude/hide/protect rule for the partial-dir because\n\t      (1) the auto-added rule may be ineffective at the end of your\n\t      other rules, or (2) you may wish to override rsync's exclude\n\t      choice.  For instance, if you want to make rsync clean-up any\n\t      left-over partial-dirs that may be lying around, you should\n\t      specify --delete-after and add a \"risk\" filter rule, e.g.  -f 'R\n\t      .rsync-partial/'.  (Avoid using --delete-before or\n\t      --delete-during unless you don't need rsync to use any of the\n\t      left-over partial-dir data during the current run.)\n\n\t      IMPORTANT: the --partial-dir should not be writable by other\n\t      users or it is a security risk.  E.g. AVOID \"/tmp\".\n\n\t      You can also set the partial-dir value the RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR\n\t      environment variable.  Setting this in the environment does not\n\t      force --partial to be enabled, but rather it affects where\n\t      partial files go when --partial is specified.  For instance,\n\t      instead of using --partial-dir=.rsync-tmp along with --progress,\n\t      you could set RSYNC_PARTIAL_DIR=.rsync-tmp in your environment\n\t      and then just use the -P option to turn on the use of the\n\t      .rsync-tmp dir for partial transfers.  The only times that the\n\t      --partial option does not look for this environment value are\n\t      (1) when --inplace was specified (since --inplace conflicts with\n\t      --partial-dir), and (2) when --delay-updates was specified (see\n\t      below).\n\n\t      For the purposes of the daemon-config's \"refuse options\"\n\t      setting, --partial-dir does not imply --partial.\tThis is so\n\t      that a refusal of the --partial option can be used to disallow\n\t      the overwriting of destination files with a partial transfer,\n\t      while still allowing the safer idiom provided by --partial-dir.\n\n       --delay-updates\n\t      This option puts the temporary file from each updated file into\n\t      a holding directory until the end of the transfer, at which time\n\t      all the files are renamed into place in rapid succession.  This\n\t      attempts to make the updating of the files a little more atomic.\n\t      By default the files are placed into a directory named \".~tmp~\"\n\t      in each file's destination directory, but if you've specified\n\t      the --partial-dir option, that directory will be used instead.\n\t      See the comments in the --partial-dir section for a discussion\n\t      of how this \".~tmp~\" dir will be excluded from the transfer, and\n\t      what you can do if you wnat rsync to cleanup old \".~tmp~\" dirs\n\t      that might be lying around.  Conflicts with --inplace and\n\t      --append.\n\n\t      This option uses more memory on the receiving side (one bit per\n\t      file transferred) and also requires enough free disk space on\n\t      the receiving side to hold an additional copy of all the updated\n\t      files.  Note also that you should not use an absolute path to\n\t      --partial-dir unless (1) there is no chance of any of the files\n\t      in the transfer having the same name (since all the updated\n\t      files will be put into a single directory if the path is\n\t      absolute) and (2) there are no mount points in the hierarchy\n\t      (since the delayed updates will fail if they can't be renamed\n\t      into place).\n\n\t      See also the \"atomic-rsync\" perl script in the \"support\" subdir\n\t      for an update algorithm that is even more atomic (it uses\n\t      --link-dest and a parallel hierarchy of files).\n\n       -m, --prune-empty-dirs\n\t      This option tells the receiving rsync to get rid of empty\n\t      directories from the file-list, including nested directories\n\t      that have no non-directory children.  This is useful for\n\t      avoiding the creation of a bunch of useless directories when the\n\t      sending rsync is recursively scanning a hierarchy of files using\n\t      include/exclude/filter rules.\n\n\t      Because the file-list is actually being pruned, this option also\n\t      affects what directories get deleted when a delete is active.\n\t      However, keep in mind that excluded files and directories can\n\t      prevent existing items from being deleted (because an exclude\n\t      hides source files and protects destination files).\n\n\t      You can prevent the pruning of certain empty directories from\n\t      the file-list by using a global \"protect\" filter.  For instance,\n\t      this option would ensure that the directory \"emptydir\" was kept\n\t      in the file-list:\n\t      --filter 'protect emptydir/'"

This gives a bored user something to\n\t      watch.  Implies --verbose if it wasn't already specified.\n\n\t      While rsync is transferring a regular file, it updates a\n\t      progress line that looks like this:\n\n\t\t    782448  63%  110.64kB/s    0:00:04\n\n\n\t      In this example, the receiver has reconstructed 782448 bytes or\n\t      63% of the sender's file, which is being reconstructed at a rate\n\t      of 110.64 kilobytes per second, and the transfer will finish in\n\t      4 seconds if the current rate is maintained until the end.\n\n\t      These statistics can be misleading if the incremental transfer\n\t      algorithm is in use.

Its\n\t      purpose is to make it much easier to specify these two options\n\t      for a long transfer that may be interrupted.\n\n       --password-file\n\t      This option allows you to provide a password in a file for\n\t      accessing a remote rsync daemon. Note that this option is only\n\t      useful when accessing an rsync daemon using the built in\n\t      transport, not when using a remote shell as the transport.

This option is inferred if there is a single\n\t      source arg and no destination specified, so its main uses are:\n\t      (1) to turn a copy command that includes a destination arg into\n\t      a file-listing command, (2) to be able to specify more than one\n\t      local source arg (note: be sure to include the destination), or\n\t      (3) to avoid the automatically added \"-r --exclude='/*/*'\"\n\t      options that rsync usually uses as a compatibility kluge when\n\t      generating a non-recursive listing.

This option is most effective when using\n\t      rsync with large files (several megabytes and up). Due to the\n\t      nature of rsync transfers, blocks of data are sent, then if\n\t      rsync determines the transfer was too fast, it will wait before\n\t      sending the next data block. The result is an average transfer\n\t      rate equaling the specified limit. A value of zero specifies no\n\t      limit.\n\n       --write-batch=FILE\n\t      Record a file that can later be applied to another identical\n\t      destination with --read-batch. See the \"BATCH MODE\" section for\n\t      details, and also the --only-write-batch option.\n\n       --only-write-batch=FILE\n\t      Works like --write-batch, except that no updates are made on the\n\t      destination system when creating the batch.  This lets you\n\t      transport the changes to the destination system via some other\n\t      means and then apply the changes via --read-batch.\n\n\t      Note that you can feel free to write the batch directly to some\n\t      portable media: if this media fills to capacity before the end\n\t      of the transfer, you can just apply that partial transfer to the\n\t      destination and repeat the whole process to get the rest of the\n\t      changes (as long as you don't mind a partially updated\n\t      destination system while the multi-update cycle is happening).\n\n\t      Also note that you only save bandwidth when pushing changes to a\n\t      remote system because this allows the batched data to be\n\t      diverted from the sender into the batch file without having to\n\t      flow over the wire to the receiver (when pulling, the sender is\n\t      remote, and thus can't write the batch).\n\n       --read-batch=FILE\n\t      Apply all of the changes stored in FILE, a file previously\n\t      generated by --write-batch.

See the \"BATCH MODE\" section for\n\t      details.\n\n       --protocol=NUM\n\t      Force an older protocol version to be used.  This is useful for\n\t      creating a batch file that is compatible with an older version\n\t      of rsync.  For instance, if rsync 2.6.4 is being used with the\n\t      --write-batch option, but rsync 2.6.3 is what will be used to\n\t      run the --read-batch option, you should use \"--protocol=28\" when\n\t      creating the batch file to force the older protocol version to\n\t      be used in the batch file (assuming you can't upgrade the rsync\n\t      on the reading system).\n\n       -4, --ipv4 or -6, --ipv6\n\t      Tells rsync to prefer IPv4/IPv6 when creating sockets.  This\n\t      only affects sockets that rsync has direct control over, such as\n\t      the outgoing socket when directly contacting an rsync daemon.\n\t      See also these options in the --daemon mode section.\n\n       --checksum-seed=NUM\n\t      Set the MD4 checksum seed to the integer NUM.  This 4 byte\n\t      checksum seed is included in each block and file MD4 checksum\n\t      calculation.  By default the checksum seed is generated by the\n\t      server and defaults to the current time() .  This option is used\n\t      to set a specific checksum seed, which is useful for\n\t      applications that want repeatable block and file checksums, or\n\t      in the case where the user wants a more random checksum seed.\n\t      Note that setting NUM to 0 causes rsync to use the default of\n\t      time() for checksum seed.\n\n       -E, --extended-attributes\n\t      Apple specific option to copy extended attributes, resource\n\t      forks, and ACLs.\tRequires at least Mac OS X 10.4 or suitably\n\t      patched rsync.\n\n       --cache\n\t      Apple specific option to enable filesystem caching of rsync file\n\t      i/o Otherwise fcntl(F_NOCACHE) is used to limit memory growth.\n\nDAEMON OPTIONS\n       The options allowed when starting an rsync daemon are as follows:\n\n       --daemon\n\t      This tells rsync that it is to run as a daemon.  The daemon you\n\t      start running may be accessed using an rsync client using the\n\t      host::module or rsync://host/module/ syntax.\n\n\t      If standard input is a socket then rsync will assume that it is\n\t      being run via inetd, otherwise it will detach from the current\n\t      terminal and become a background daemon.\tThe daemon will read\n\t      the config file (rsyncd.conf) on each connect made by a client\n\t      and respond to requests accordingly.  See the rsyncd.conf(5) man\n\t      page for more details.\n\n       --address\n\t      By default rsync will bind to the wildcard address when run as a\n\t      daemon with the --daemon option.\tThe --address option allows\n\t      you to specify a specific IP address (or hostname) to bind to.\n\t      This makes virtual hosting possible in conjunction with the\n\t      --config option.\tSee also the \"address\" global option in the\n\t      rsyncd.conf manpage.\n\n       --bwlimit=KBPS\n\t      This option allows you to specify a maximum transfer rate in\n\t      kilobytes per second for the data the daemon sends.  The client\n\t      can still specify a smaller --bwlimit value, but their requested\n\t      value will be rounded down if they try to exceed it.  See the\n\t      client version of this option (above) for some extra details.\n\n       --config=FILE\n\t      This specifies an alternate config file than the default.  This\n\t      is only relevant when --daemon is specified.  The default is\n\t      /etc/rsyncd.conf unless the daemon is running over a remote\n\t      shell program and the remote user is not the super-user; in that\n\t      case the default is rsyncd.conf in the current directory\n\t      (typically $HOME).\n\n       --no-detach\n\t      When running as a daemon, this option instructs rsync to not\n\t      detach itself and become a background process.  This option is\n\t      required when running as a service on Cygwin, and may also be\n\t      useful when rsync is supervised by a program such as daemontools\n\t      or AIX's System Resource Controller.  --no-detach is also\n\t      recommended when rsync is run under a debugger.

The rules either\n       directly specify include/exclude patterns or they specify a way to\n       acquire more include/exclude patterns (e.g. to read them from a file).\n\n       As the list of files/directories to transfer is built, rsync checks\n       each name to be transferred against the list of include/exclude\n       patterns in turn, and the first matching pattern is acted on:  if it is\n       an exclude pattern, then that file is skipped; if it is an include\n       pattern then that filename is not skipped; if no matching pattern is\n       found, then the filename is not skipped.\n\n       Rsync builds an ordered list of filter rules as specified on the\n       command-line.  Filter rules have the following syntax:\n\n\t      RULE [PATTERN_OR_FILENAME]\n\t      RULE,MODIFIERS [PATTERN_OR_FILENAME]\n\n\n       You have your choice of using either short or long RULE names, as\n       described below.  If you use a short-named rule, the ',' separating the\n       RULE from the MODIFIERS is optional.  The PATTERN or FILENAME that\n       follows (when present) must come after either a single space or an\n       underscore (_).\tHere are the available rule prefixes:\n\n\t      exclude, - specifies an exclude pattern.\n\t      include, + specifies an include pattern.\n\t      merge, . specifies a merge-file to read for more rules.\n\t      dir-merge, : specifies a per-directory merge-file.\n\t      hide, H specifies a pattern for hiding files from the transfer.\n\t      show, S files that match the pattern are not hidden.\n\t      protect, P specifies a pattern for protecting files from\n\t      deletion.\n\t      risk, R files that match the pattern are not protected.\n\t      clear, ! clears the current include/exclude list (takes no arg)"

A\n       --filter option, on the other hand, must always contain either a short\n       or long rule name at the start of the rule.\n\n       Note also that the --filter, --include, and --exclude options take one\n       rule/pattern each. To add multiple ones, you can repeat the options on\n       the command-line, use the merge-file syntax of the --filter option, or\n       the --include-from/--exclude-from options.\n\nINCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERN RULES\n       You can include and exclude files by specifying patterns using the \"+\",\n       \"-\", etc. filter rules (as introduced in the FILTER RULES section\n       above).\tThe include/exclude rules each specify a pattern that is\n       matched against the names of the files that are going to be\n       transferred.  These patterns can take several forms:\n\n       o      if the pattern starts with a / then it is anchored to a\n\t      particular spot in the hierarchy of files, otherwise it is\n\t      matched against the end of the pathname.\tThis is similar to a\n\t      leading ^ in regular expressions.  Thus \"/foo\" would match a\n\t      file named \"foo\" at either the \"root of the transfer\" (for a\n\t      global rule) or in the merge-file's directory (for a per-\n\t      directory rule).\tAn unqualified \"foo\" would match any file or\n\t      directory named \"foo\" anywhere in the tree because the algorithm\n\t      is applied recursively from the top down; it behaves as if each\n\t      path component gets a turn at being the end of the file name.\n\t      Even the unanchored \"sub/foo\" would match at any point in the\n\t      hierarchy where a \"foo\" was found within a directory named\n\t      \"sub\".  See the section on ANCHORING INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERNS\n\t      for a full discussion of how to specify a pattern that matches\n\t      at the root of the transfer.\n\n       o      if the pattern ends with a / then it will only match a\n\t      directory, not a file, link, or device.\n\n       o      rsync chooses between doing a simple string match and wildcard\n\t      matching by checking if the pattern contains one of these three\n\t      wildcard characters: '*', '?', and '[' .\n\n       o      a '*' matches any non-empty path component (it stops at\n\t      slashes).\n\n       o      use '**' to match anything, including slashes.\n\n       o      a '?' matches any character except a slash (/).\n\n       o      a '[' introduces a character class, such as [a-z] or\n\t      [[:alpha:]].\n\n       o      in a wildcard pattern, a backslash can be used to escape a\n\t      wildcard character, but it is matched literally when no\n\t      wildcards are present.\n\n       o      if the pattern contains a / (not counting a trailing /) or a\n\t      \"**\", then it is matched against the full pathname, including\n\t      any leading directories. If the pattern doesn't contain a / or a\n\t      \"**\", then it is matched only against the final component of the\n\t      filename.  (Remember that the algorithm is applied recursively\n\t      so \"full filename\" can actually be any portion of a path from\n\t      the starting directory on down.)\n\n       o      a trailing \"dir_name/***\" will match both the directory (as if\n\t      \"dir_name/\" had been specified) and all the files in the\n\t      directory (as if \"dir_name/**\" had been specified).

The exclude patterns actually short-\n       circuit the directory traversal stage when rsync finds the files to\n       send.  If a pattern excludes a particular parent directory, it can\n       render a deeper include pattern ineffectual because rsync did not\n       descend through that excluded section of the hierarchy.\tThis is\n       particularly important when using a trailing '*' rule.  For instance,\n       this won't work:\n\n\t      + /some/path/this-file-will-not-be-found\n\t      + /file-is-included\n\t      - *\n\n\n       This fails because the parent directory \"some\" is excluded by the '*'\n       rule, so rsync never visits any of the files in the \"some\" or\n       \"some/path\" directories.  One solution is to ask for all directories in\n       the hierarchy to be included by using a single rule: \"+ */\" (put it\n       somewhere before the \"- *\" rule), and perhaps use the\n       --prune-empty-dirs option.

To affect the other CVS exclude rules (i.e. the default list of\n       exclusions, the contents of $HOME/.cvsignore, and the value of\n       $CVSIGNORE) you should omit the -C command-line option and instead\n       insert a \"-C\" rule into your filter rules; e.g. \"--filter=-C\".\n\nLIST-CLEARING FILTER RULE\n       You can clear the current include/exclude list by using the \"!\" filter\n       rule (as introduced in the FILTER RULES section above).\tThe \"current\"\n       list is either the global list of rules (if the rule is encountered\n       while parsing the filter options) or a set of per-directory rules\n       (which are inherited in their own sub-list, so a subdirectory can use\n       this to clear out the parent's rules).\n\nANCHORING INCLUDE/EXCLUDE PATTERNS\n       As mentioned earlier, global include/exclude patterns are anchored at\n       the \"root of the transfer\" (as opposed to per-directory patterns, which\n       are anchored at the merge-file's directory).  If you think of the\n       transfer as a subtree of names that are being sent from sender to\n       receiver, the transfer-root is where the tree starts to be duplicated\n       in the destination directory.  This root governs where patterns that\n       start with a / match.\n\n       Because the matching is relative to the transfer-root, changing the\n       trailing slash on a source path or changing your use of the --relative\n       option affects the path you need to use in your matching (in addition\n       to changing how much of the file tree is duplicated on the destination\n       host).  The following examples demonstrate this.\n\n       Let's say that we want to match two source files, one with an absolute\n       path of \"/home/me/foo/bar\", and one with a path of \"/home/you/bar/baz\".\n       Here is how the various command choices differ for a 2-source transfer:\n\n\t      Example cmd: rsync -a /home/me /home/you /dest\n\t      +/- pattern: /me/foo/bar\n\t      +/- pattern: /you/bar/baz\n\t      Target file: /dest/me/foo/bar\n\t      Target file: /dest/you/bar/baz"

Suppose one has a tree which is replicated on a\n       number of hosts.  Now suppose some changes have been made to this\n       source tree and those changes need to be propagated to the other hosts.\n       In order to do this using batch mode, rsync is run with the write-batch\n       option to apply the changes made to the source tree to one of the\n       destination trees.  The write-batch option causes the rsync client to\n       store in a \"batch file\" all the information needed to repeat this\n       operation against other, identical destination trees.\n\n       To apply the recorded changes to another destination tree, run rsync\n       with the read-batch option, specifying the name of the same batch file,\n       and the destination tree.  Rsync updates the destination tree using the\n       information stored in the batch file.\n\n       For convenience, one additional file is creating when the write-batch\n       option is used.\tThis file's name is created by appending \".sh\" to the\n       batch filename.\tThe .sh file contains a command-line suitable for\n       updating a destination tree using that batch file. It can be executed\n       using a Bourne (or Bourne-like) shell, optionally passing in an\n       alternate destination tree pathname which is then used instead of the\n       original path. This is useful when the destination tree path differs\n       from the original destination tree path.\n\n       Generating the batch file once saves having to perform the file status,\n       checksum, and data block generation more than once when updating\n       multiple destination trees. Multicast transport protocols can be used\n       to transfer the batch update files in parallel to many hosts at once,\n       instead of sending the same data to every host individually.\n\n       Examples:\n\n\t      $ rsync --write-batch=foo -a host:/source/dir/ /adest/dir/\n\t      $ scp foo* remote:\n\t      $ ssh remote ./foo.sh /bdest/dir/"

The host \"remote\" is then updated with the batched\n       data going into the directory /bdest/dir.  The differences between the\n       two examples reveals some of the flexibility you have in how you deal\n       with batches:\n\n       o      The first example shows that the initial copy doesn't have to be\n\t      local -- you can push or pull data to/from a remote host using\n\t      either the remote-shell syntax or rsync daemon syntax, as\n\t      desired.\n\n       o      The first example uses the created \"foo.sh\" file to get the\n\t      right rsync options when running the read-batch command on the\n\t      remote host.\n\n       o      The second example reads the batch data via standard input so\n\t      that the batch file doesn't need to be copied to the remote\n\t      machine first.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `rsync`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nCaveats:\n\n       The read-batch option expects the destination tree that it is updating\n       to be identical to the destination tree that was used to create the\n       batch update fileset.  When a difference between the destination trees\n       is encountered the update might be discarded with a warning (if the\n       file appears to be up-to-date already) or the file-update may be\n       attempted and then, if the file fails to verify, the update discarded\n       with an error.  This means that it should be safe to re-run a read-\n       batch operation if the command got interrupted.\tIf you wish to force\n       the batched-update to always be attempted regardless of the file's size\n       and date, use the -I option (when reading the batch).  If an error\n       occurs, the destination tree will probably be in a partially updated\n       state. In that case, rsync can be used in its regular (non-batch) mode\n       of operation to fix up the destination tree.\n\n       The rsync version used on all destinations must be at least as new as\n       the one used to generate the batch file.  Rsync will die with an error\n       if the protocol version in the batch file is too new for the batch-\n       reading rsync to handle.  See also the --protocol option for a way to\n       have the creating rsync generate a batch file that an older rsync can\n       understand.  (Note that batch files changed format in version 2.6.3, so\n       mixing versions older than that with newer versions will not work.)\n\n       When reading a batch file, rsync will force the value of certain\n       options to match the data in the batch file if you didn't set them to\n       the same as the batch-writing command.  Other options can (and should)\n       be changed.  For instance --write-batch changes to --read-batch,\n       --files-from is dropped, and the --filter/--include/--exclude options\n       are not needed unless one of the --delete options is specified.\n\n       The code that creates the BATCH.sh file transforms any\n       filter/include/exclude options into a single list that is appended as a\n       \"here\" document to the shell script file.  An advanced user can use\n       this to modify the exclude list if a change in what gets deleted by\n       --delete is desired.  A normal user can ignore this detail and just use\n       the shell script as an easy way to run the appropriate --read-batch\n       command for the batched data.\n\n       The original batch mode in rsync was based on \"rsync+\", but the latest\n       version uses a new implementation.\n\nSYMBOLIC LINKS\n       Three basic behaviors are possible when rsync encounters a symbolic\n       link in the source directory.\n\n       By default, symbolic links are not transferred at all.  A message\n       \"skipping non-regular\" file is emitted for any symlinks that exist.\n\n       If --links is specified, then symlinks are recreated with the same\n       target on the destination.  Note that --archive implies --links.\n\n       If --copy-links is specified, then symlinks are \"collapsed\" by copying\n       their referent, rather than the symlink.\n\n       rsync also distinguishes \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" symbolic links.  An\n       example where this might be used is a web site mirror that wishes\n       ensure the rsync module they copy does not include symbolic links to\n       /etc/passwd in the public section of the site.  Using\n       --copy-unsafe-links will cause any links to be copied as the file they\n       point to on the destination.  Using --safe-links will cause unsafe\n       links to be omitted altogether.\t(Note that you must specify --links\n       for --safe-links to have any effect.)\n\n       Symbolic links are considered unsafe if they are absolute symlinks\n       (start with /), empty, or if they contain enough \"..\" components to\n       ascend from the directory being copied.\n\n       Here's a summary of how the symlink options are interpreted.  The list\n       is in order of precedence, so if your combination of options isn't\n       mentioned, use the first line that is a complete subset of your\n       options:\n\n       --copy-links\n\t      Turn all symlinks into normal files (leaving no symlinks for any\n\t      other options to affect).\n\n       --links --copy-unsafe-links\n\t      Turn all unsafe symlinks into files and duplicate all safe\n\t      symlinks.\n\n       --copy-unsafe-links\n\t      Turn all unsafe symlinks into files, noisily skip all safe\n\t      symlinks.\n\n       --links --safe-links\n\t      Duplicate safe symlinks and skip unsafe ones.\n\n       --links\n\t      Duplicate all symlinks.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       rsync occasionally produces error messages that may seem a little\n       cryptic. The one that seems to cause the most confusion is \"protocol\n       version mismatch -- is your shell clean?\".\n\n       This message is usually caused by your startup scripts or remote shell\n       facility producing unwanted garbage on the stream that rsync is using\n       for its transport. The way to diagnose this problem is to run your\n       remote shell like this:\n\n\t      ssh remotehost /bin/true > out.dat"
