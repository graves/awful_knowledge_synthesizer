The tk_getOpenFile\n       command is usually associated with the Open command in the File menu.\n       Its purpose is for the user to select an existing file only. If the\n       user enters a non-existent file, the dialog box gives the user an error\n       prompt and requires the user to give an alternative selection. If an\n       application allows the user to create new files, it should do so by\n       providing a separate New menu command."

    Manpage text:

    Several file patterns may have the same typeName, in which case they
           refer to the same file type and share the same entry in the listbox.
           When the user selects an entry in the listbox, all the files that match
           at least one of the file patterns corresponding to that entry are
           listed. Usually, each file pattern corresponds to a distinct type of
           file. The use of more than one file pattern for one type of file is
           only necessary on the Macintosh platform.

           On the Macintosh platform, a file matches a file pattern if its name
           matches at least one of the extension(s) AND it belongs to at least one
           of the macType(s) of the file pattern. For example, the C Source Files
           file pattern in the sample code matches with files that have a .c
           extension AND belong to the macType TEXT. To use the OR rule instead,
           you can use two file patterns, one with the extensions only and the
           other with the macType only. The GIF Files file type in the sample code
           matches files that either have a .gif extension OR belong to the
           macType GIFF.
