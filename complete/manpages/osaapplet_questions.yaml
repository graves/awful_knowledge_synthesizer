- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `osaapplet`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nosaapplet(8)\t\t    System Manager's Manual\t\t  osaapplet(8)\n\nNAME\n     osaapplet – Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) applet interpreter\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     osaapplet path\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     osaapplet provides the standard script application “shell” for an Open\n     Scripting Architecture (OSA) script.  It provides a menu bar and optional\n     splash dialog, and handles routing incoming Apple events to the script,\n     notably the run and open events.  It is normally used as the interpreter\n     for a script file, like this:\n\n\t   #!/usr/libexec/osaapplet\n\n     The script, which may be compiled script data, may either follow the\n     interpreter line or be a separate file in the traditional bundle location\n     Resources/Scripts/main.scpt.  osaapplet assumes that it is running inside\n     a bundle; running it without a bundle may produce unexpected results.\n\nHISTORY\n     osaapplet was introduced in OS X 10.10.\n\nOS X\t\t\t\t    5/7/14\t\t\t\t  OS X"
