It is\n       a function-level profiler; that is, it collects only function-level\n       information, not the more detailed line-level information.  It operates\n       by redefining the Tcl proc command.  Profiling is initiated via the\n       ::profiler::init command.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::profiler::init\n\t      Initiate profiling.  All procedures created after this command\n\t      is called will be profiled.  To profile an entire application,\n\t      this command must be called before any other commands."
