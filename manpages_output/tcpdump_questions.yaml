The following gives a\n       brief description and examples of most of the formats.\n\n       Timestamps\n\n       By default, all output lines are preceded by a timestamp.  The\n       timestamp is the current clock time in the form\n\t      hh:mm:ss.frac\n       and is as accurate as the kernel's clock.  The timestamp reflects the\n       time the kernel applied a time stamp to the packet.  No attempt is made\n       to account for the time lag between when the network interface finished\n       receiving the packet from the network and when the kernel applied a\n       time stamp to the packet; that time lag could include a delay between\n       the time when the network interface finished receiving a packet from\n       the network and the time when an interrupt was delivered to the kernel\n       to get it to read the packet and a delay between the time when the\n       kernel serviced the `new packet' interrupt and the time when it applied\n       a time stamp to the packet.\n\n       Link Level Headers\n\n       If the '-e' option is given, the link level header is printed out.  On\n       Ethernets, the source and destination addresses, protocol, and packet\n       length are printed.\n\n       On FDDI networks, the  '-e' option causes tcpdump to print the `frame\n       control' field,\tthe source and destination addresses, and the packet\n       length.\t(The `frame control' field governs the interpretation of the\n       rest of the packet.  Normal packets (such as those containing IP\n       datagrams) are `async' packets, with a priority value between 0 and 7;\n       for example, `async4'.  Such packets are assumed to contain an 802.2\n       Logical Link Control (LLC) packet; the LLC header is printed if it is\n       not an ISO datagram or a so-called SNAP packet.\n\n       On Token Ring networks, the '-e' option causes tcpdump to print the\n       `access control' and `frame control' fields, the source and destination\n       addresses, and the packet length.  As on FDDI networks, packets are\n       assumed to contain an LLC packet.  Regardless of whether the '-e'\n       option is specified or not, the source routing information is printed\n       for source-routed packets.\n\n       On 802.11 networks, the '-e' option causes tcpdump to print the `frame\n       control' fields, all of the addresses in the 802.11 header, and the\n       packet length.  As on FDDI networks, packets are assumed to contain an\n       LLC packet.\n\n       (N.B.: The following description assumes familiarity with the SLIP\n       compression algorithm described in RFC-1144.)\n\n       On SLIP links, a direction indicator (``I'' for inbound, ``O'' for\n       outbound), packet type, and compression information are printed out.\n       The packet type is printed first.  The three types are ip, utcp, and\n       ctcp.  No further link information is printed for ip packets.  For TCP\n       packets, the connection identifier is printed following the type.  If\n       the packet is compressed, its encoded header is printed out.  The\n       special cases are printed out as *S+n and *SA+n, where n is the amount\n       by which the sequence number (or sequence number and ack) has changed.\n       If it is not a special case, zero or more changes are printed.  A\n       change is indicated by U (urgent pointer), W (window), A (ack), S\n       (sequence number), and I (packet ID), followed by a delta (+n or -n),\n       or a new value (=n).  Finally, the amount of data in the packet and\n       compressed header length are printed.\n\n       For example, the following line shows an outbound compressed TCP\n       packet, with an implicit connection identifier; the ack has changed by\n       6, the sequence number by 49, and the packet ID by 6; there are 3 bytes\n       of data and 6 bytes of compressed header:\n\t      O ctcp * A+6 S+49 I+6 3 (6)\n\n       ARP/RARP Packets\n\n       ARP/RARP output shows the type of request and its arguments.  The\n       format is intended to be self explanatory.  Here is a short sample\n       taken from the start of an `rlogin' from host rtsg to host csam:\n\t      arp who-has csam tell rtsg\n\t      arp reply csam is-at CSAM\n       The first line says that rtsg sent an ARP packet asking for the\n       Ethernet address of internet host csam.\tCsam replies with its Ethernet\n       address (in this example, Ethernet addresses are in caps and internet\n       addresses in lower case).\n\n       This would look less redundant if we had done tcpdump -n:\n\t      arp who-has 128.3.254.6 tell 128.3.254.68\n\t      arp reply 128.3.254.6 is-at 02:07:01:00:01:c4\n\n       If we had done tcpdump -e, the fact that the first packet is broadcast\n       and the second is point-to-point would be visible:\n\t      RTSG Broadcast 0806  64: arp who-has csam tell rtsg\n\t      CSAM RTSG 0806  64: arp reply csam is-at CSAM\n       For the first packet this says the Ethernet source address is RTSG, the\n       destination is the Ethernet broadcast address, the type field contained\n       hex 0806 (type ETHER_ARP) and the total length was 64 bytes.\n\n       IPv4 Packets\n\n       If the link-layer header is not being printed, for IPv4 packets, IP is\n       printed after the time stamp.\n\n       If the -v flag is specified, information from the IPv4 header is shown\n       in parentheses after the IP or the link-layer header.  The general\n       format of this information is:\n\t      tos tos, ttl ttl, id id, offset offset, flags [flags], proto proto, length length, options (options)\n       tos is the type of service field; if the ECN bits are non-zero, those\n       are reported as ECT(1), ECT(0), or CE.  ttl is the time-to-live; it is\n       not reported if it is zero.  id is the IP identification field.\toffset\n       is the fragment offset field; it is printed whether this is part of a\n       fragmented datagram or not.  flags are the MF and DF flags; + is\n       reported if MF is set, and DF is reported if F is set.  If neither are\n       set, . is reported.  proto is the protocol ID field.  length is the\n       total length field.  options are the IP options, if any.\n\n       Next, for TCP and UDP packets, the source and destination IP addresses\n       and TCP or UDP ports, with a dot between each IP address and its\n       corresponding port, will be printed, with a > separating the source and\n       destination.  For other protocols, the addresses will be printed, with\n       a > separating the source and destination.  Higher level protocol\n       information, if any, will be printed after that.\n\n       For fragmented IP datagrams, the first fragment contains the higher\n       level protocol header; fragments after the first contain no higher\n       level protocol header.  Fragmentation information will be printed only\n       with the -v flag, in the IP header information, as described above.\n\n       TCP Packets\n\n       (N.B.:The following description assumes familiarity with the TCP\n       protocol described in RFC-793.  If you are not familiar with the\n       protocol, this description will not be of much use to you.)\n\n       The general format of a TCP protocol line is:\n\t      src > dst: Flags [tcpflags], seq data-seqno, ack ackno, win window, urg urgent, options [opts], length len\n       Src and dst are the source and destination IP addresses and ports.\n       Tcpflags are some combination of S (SYN), F (FIN), P (PUSH), R (RST), U\n       (URG), W (ECN CWR), E (ECN-Echo) or `.' (ACK), or `none' if no flags\n       are set.  Data-seqno describes the portion of sequence space covered by\n       the data in this packet (see example below).  Ackno is sequence number\n       of the next data expected the other direction on this connection.\n       Window is the number of bytes of receive buffer space available the\n       other direction on this connection.  Urg indicates there is `urgent'\n       data in the packet.  Opts are TCP options (e.g., mss 1024).  Len is the\n       length of payload data.\n\n       Iptype, Src, dst, and flags are always present.\tThe other fields\n       depend on the contents of the packet's TCP protocol header and are\n       output only if appropriate.\n\n       Here is the opening portion of an rlogin from host rtsg to host csam.\n\t      IP rtsg.1023 > csam.login: Flags [S], seq 768512:768512, win 4096, opts [mss 1024]\n\t      IP csam.login > rtsg.1023: Flags [S.], seq, 947648:947648, ack 768513, win 4096, opts [mss 1024]\n\t      IP rtsg.1023 > csam.login: Flags [.], ack 1, win 4096\n\t      IP rtsg.1023 > csam.login: Flags [P.], seq 1:2, ack 1, win 4096, length 1\n\t      IP csam.login > rtsg.1023: Flags [.], ack 2, win 4096\n\t      IP rtsg.1023 > csam.login: Flags [P.], seq 2:21, ack 1, win 4096, length 19\n\t      IP csam.login > rtsg.1023: Flags [P.], seq 1:2, ack 21, win 4077, length 1\n\t      IP csam.login > rtsg.1023: Flags [P.], seq 2:3, ack 21, win 4077, urg 1, length 1\n\t      IP csam.login > rtsg.1023: Flags [P.], seq 3:4, ack 21, win 4077, urg 1, length 1\n       The first line says that TCP port 1023 on rtsg sent a packet to port\n       login on csam.  The S indicates that the SYN flag was set.  The packet\n       sequence number was 768512 and it contained no data.  (The notation is\n       `first:last' which means `sequence numbers first up to but not\n       including last'.)  There was no piggy-backed ACK, the available receive\n       window was 4096 bytes and there was a max-segment-size option\n       requesting an MSS of 1024 bytes.\n\n       Csam replies with a similar packet except it includes a piggy-backed\n       ACK for rtsg's SYN.  Rtsg then ACKs csam's SYN.\tThe `.' means the ACK\n       flag was set.  The packet contained no data so there is no data\n       sequence number or length.  Note that the ACK sequence number is a\n       small integer (1).  The first time tcpdump sees a TCP `conversation',\n       it prints the sequence number from the packet.  On subsequent packets\n       of the conversation, the difference between the current packet's\n       sequence number and this initial sequence number is printed.  This\n       means that sequence numbers after the first can be interpreted as\n       relative byte positions in the conversation's data stream (with the\n       first data byte each direction being `1').  `-S' will override this\n       feature, causing the original sequence numbers to be output.\n\n       On the 6th line, rtsg sends csam 19 bytes of data (bytes 2 through 20\n       in the rtsg → csam side of the conversation).  The PUSH flag is set in\n       the packet.  On the 7th line, csam says it's received data sent by rtsg\n       up to but not including byte 21.  Most of this data is apparently\n       sitting in the socket buffer since csam's receive window has gotten 19\n       bytes smaller.  Csam also sends one byte of data to rtsg in this\n       packet.\tOn the 8th and 9th lines, csam sends two bytes of urgent,\n       pushed data to rtsg.\n\n       If the snapshot was small enough that tcpdump didn't capture the full\n       TCP header, it interprets as much of the header as it can and then\n       reports ``[|tcp]'' to indicate the remainder could not be interpreted.\n       If the header contains a bogus option (one with a length that's either\n       too small or beyond the end of the header), tcpdump reports it as\n       ``[bad opt]'' and does not interpret any further options (since it's\n       impossible to tell where they start).  If the header length indicates\n       options are present but the IP datagram length is not long enough for\n       the options to actually be there, tcpdump reports it as ``[bad hdr\n       length]''.\n\n       Capturing TCP packets with particular flag combinations (SYN-ACK,\n       URG-ACK, etc.)\n\n       There are 8 bits in the control bits section of the TCP header:\n\n\t      CWR | ECE | URG | ACK | PSH | RST | SYN | FIN\n\n       Let's assume that we want to watch packets used in establishing a TCP\n       connection.  Recall that TCP uses a 3-way handshake protocol when it\n       initializes a new connection; the connection sequence with regard to\n       the TCP control bits is\n\n\t      1) Caller sends SYN\n\t      2) Recipient responds with SYN, ACK\n\t      3) Caller sends ACK\n\n       Now we're interested in capturing packets that have only the SYN bit\n       set (Step 1).  Note that we don't want packets from step 2 (SYN-ACK),\n       just a plain initial SYN.  What we need is a correct filter expression\n       for tcpdump.\n\n       Recall the structure of a TCP header without options:\n\n\t0\t\t\t     15 \t\t\t     31\n       -----------------------------------------------------------------\n       |\t  source port\t       |       destination port        |\n       -----------------------------------------------------------------\n       |\t\t\tsequence number \t\t       |\n       -----------------------------------------------------------------\n       |\t\t     acknowledgment number\t\t       |\n       -----------------------------------------------------------------\n       |  HL   | rsvd  |C|E|U|A|P|R|S|F|\twindow size\t       |\n       -----------------------------------------------------------------\n       |\t TCP checksum\t       |       urgent pointer\t       |\n       -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       A TCP header usually holds 20 octets of data, unless options are\n       present.  The first line of the graph contains octets 0 - 3, the second\n       line shows octets 4 - 7 etc.\n\n       Starting to count with 0, the relevant TCP control bits are contained\n       in octet 13:\n\n\t0\t      7|\t     15|\t     23|\t     31\n       ----------------|---------------|---------------|----------------\n       |  HL   | rsvd  |C|E|U|A|P|R|S|F|\twindow size\t       |\n       ----------------|---------------|---------------|----------------\n       |\t       |  13th octet   |\t       |\t       |\n\n       Let's have a closer look at octet no. 13:\n\n\t\t       |\t       |\n\t\t       |---------------|\n\t\t       |C|E|U|A|P|R|S|F|\n\t\t       |---------------|\n\t\t       |7   5\t3     0|\n\n       These are the TCP control bits we are interested in.  We have numbered\n       the bits in this octet from 0 to 7, right to left, so the PSH bit is\n       bit number 3, while the URG bit is number 5.\n\n       Recall that we want to capture packets with only SYN set.  Let's see\n       what happens to octet 13 if a TCP datagram arrives with the SYN bit set\n       in its header:\n\n\t\t       |C|E|U|A|P|R|S|F|\n\t\t       |---------------|\n\t\t       |0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0|\n\t\t       |---------------|\n\t\t       |7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0|\n\n       Looking at the control bits section we see that only bit number 1 (SYN)\n       is set.\n\n       Assuming that octet number 13 is an 8-bit unsigned integer in network\n       byte order, the binary value of this octet is\n\n\t      00000010\n\n       and its decimal representation is\n\n\t  7\t6     5     4\t  3\t2     1     0\n       0*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 1*2 + 0*2  =  2\n\n       We're almost done, because now we know that if only SYN is set, the\n       value of the 13th octet in the TCP header, when interpreted as a 8-bit\n       unsigned integer in network byte order, must be exactly 2.\n\n       This relationship can be expressed as\n\t      tcp[13] == 2\n\n       We can use this expression as the filter for tcpdump in order to watch\n       packets which have only SYN set:\n\t      tcpdump -i xl0 tcp[13] == 2\n\n       The expression says \"let the 13th octet of a TCP datagram have the\n       decimal value 2\", which is exactly what we want.\n\n       Now, let's assume that we need to capture SYN packets, but we don't\n       care if ACK or any other TCP control bit is set at the same time.\n       Let's see what happens to octet 13 when a TCP datagram with SYN-ACK set\n       arrives:\n\n\t    |C|E|U|A|P|R|S|F|\n\t    |---------------|\n\t    |0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0|\n\t    |---------------|\n\t    |7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0|\n\n       Now bits 1 and 4 are set in the 13th octet.  The binary value of octet\n       13 is\n\n\t\t   00010010\n\n       which translates to decimal\n\n\t  7\t6     5     4\t  3\t2     1     0\n       0*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 1*2 + 0*2 + 0*2 + 1*2 + 0*2   = 18\n\n       Now we can't just use 'tcp[13] == 18' in the tcpdump filter expression,\n       because that would select only those packets that have SYN-ACK set, but\n       not those with only SYN set.  Remember that we don't care if ACK or any\n       other control bit is set as long as SYN is set.\n\n       In order to achieve our goal, we need to logically AND the binary value\n       of octet 13 with some other value to preserve the SYN bit.  We know\n       that we want SYN to be set in any case, so we'll logically AND the\n       value in the 13th octet with the binary value of a SYN:"

The decimal\n       representation of the AND value as well as the result of this operation\n       is 2 (binary 00000010), so we know that for packets with SYN set the\n       following relation must hold true:\n\n\t      ( ( value of octet 13 ) AND ( 2 ) ) == ( 2 )\n\n       This points us to the tcpdump filter expression\n\t\t   tcpdump -i xl0 'tcp[13] & 2 == 2'\n\n       Some offsets and field values may be expressed as names rather than as\n       numeric values.

The packet\n       contained 84 bytes of user data.\n\n       Some UDP services are recognized (from the source or destination port\n       number) and the higher level protocol information printed.  In\n       particular, Domain Name service requests (RFC-1034/1035) and Sun RPC\n       calls (RFC-1050) to NFS.\n\n       TCP or UDP Name Server Requests\n\n       (N.B.:The following description assumes familiarity with the Domain\n       Service protocol described in RFC-1035.\tIf you are not familiar with\n       the protocol, the following description will appear to be written in\n       Greek.)\n\n       Name server requests are formatted as\n\t      src > dst: id op? flags qtype qclass name (len)\n\t      h2opolo.1538 > helios.domain: 3+ A? ucbvax.berkeley.edu. (37)\n       Host h2opolo asked the domain server on helios for an address record\n       (qtype=A) associated with the name ucbvax.berkeley.edu. The query id\n       was `3'.  The `+' indicates the recursion desired flag was set.\tThe\n       query length was 37 bytes, excluding the TCP or UDP and IP protocol\n       headers.  The query operation was the normal one, Query, so the op\n       field was omitted.  If the op had been anything else, it would have\n       been printed between the `3' and the `+'.  Similarly, the qclass was\n       the normal one, C_IN, and omitted.  Any other qclass would have been\n       printed immediately after the `A'.\n\n       A few anomalies are checked and may result in extra fields enclosed in\n       square brackets:  If a query contains an answer, authority records or\n       additional records section, ancount, nscount, or arcount are printed as\n       `[na]', `[nn]' or  `[nau]' where n is the appropriate count.  If any of\n       the response bits are set (AA, RA or rcode) or any of the `must be\n       zero' bits are set in bytes two and three, `[b2&3=x]' is printed, where\n       x is the hex value of header bytes two and three.\n\n       TCP or UDP Name Server Responses\n\n       Name server responses are formatted as\n\t      src > dst:  id op rcode flags a/n/au type class data (len)\n\t      helios.domain > h2opolo.1538: 3 3/3/7 A 128.32.137.3 (273)\n\t      helios.domain > h2opolo.1537: 2 NXDomain* 0/1/0 (97)\n       In the first example, helios responds to query id 3 from h2opolo with 3\n       answer records, 3 name server records and 7 additional records.\tThe\n       first answer record is type A (address) and its data is internet\n       address 128.32.137.3.  The total size of the response was 273 bytes,\n       excluding TCP or UDP and IP headers.  The op (Query) and response code\n       (NoError) were omitted, as was the class (C_IN) of the A record.\n\n       In the second example, helios responds to query 2 with a response code\n       of non-existent domain (NXDomain) with no answers, one name server and\n       no authority records.  The `*' indicates that the authoritative answer\n       bit was set.  Since there were no answers, no type, class or data were\n       printed.\n\n       Other flag characters that might appear are `-' (recursion available,\n       RA, not set) and `|' (truncated message, TC, set).  If the `question'\n       section doesn't contain exactly one entry, `[nq]' is printed.\n\n       SMB/CIFS decoding\n\n       tcpdump now includes fairly extensive SMB/CIFS/NBT decoding for data on\n       UDP/137, UDP/138 and TCP/139.  Some primitive decoding of IPX and\n       NetBEUI SMB data is also done.\n\n       By default a fairly minimal decode is done, with a much more detailed\n       decode done if -v is used.  Be warned that with -v a single SMB packet\n       may take up a page or more, so only use -v if you really want all the\n       gory details.\n\n       For information on SMB packet formats and what all the fields mean see\n       https://download.samba.org/pub/samba/specs/ and other online resources.\n       The SMB patches were written by Andrew Tridgell (tridge@samba.org).\n\n       NFS Requests and Replies\n\n       Sun NFS (Network File System) requests and replies are printed as:\n\t      src.sport > dst.nfs: NFS request xid xid len op args\n\t      src.nfs > dst.dport: NFS reply xid xid reply stat len op results\n\n\t      sushi.1023 > wrl.nfs: NFS request xid 26377\n\t\t   112 readlink fh 21,24/10.73165\n\t      wrl.nfs > sushi.1023: NFS reply xid 26377\n\t\t   reply ok 40 readlink \"../var\"\n\t      sushi.1022 > wrl.nfs: NFS request xid 8219\n\t\t   144 lookup fh 9,74/4096.6878 \"xcolors\"\n\t      wrl.nfs > sushi.1022: NFS reply xid 8219\n\t\t   reply ok 128 lookup fh 9,74/4134.3150\n\n       In the first line, host sushi sends a transaction with id 26377 to wrl.\n       The request was 112 bytes, excluding the UDP and IP headers.  The\n       operation was a readlink (read symbolic link) on file handle (fh)\n       21,24/10.731657119.  (If one is lucky, as in this case, the file handle\n       can be interpreted as a major,minor device number pair, followed by the\n       inode number and generation number.) In the second line, wrl replies\n       `ok' with the same transaction id and the contents of the link.\n\n       In the third line, sushi asks (using a new transaction id) wrl to\n       lookup the name `xcolors' in directory file 9,74/4096.6878. In the\n       fourth line, wrl sends a reply with the respective transaction id.\n\n       Note that the data printed depends on the operation type.  The format\n       is intended to be self explanatory if read in conjunction with an NFS\n       protocol spec.  Also note that older versions of tcpdump printed NFS\n       packets in a slightly different format: the transaction id (xid) would\n       be printed instead of the non-NFS port number of the packet.\n\n       If the -v (verbose) flag is given, additional information is printed.\n       For example:\n\n\t      sushi.1023 > wrl.nfs: NFS request xid 79658\n\t\t   148 read fh 21,11/12.195 8192 bytes @ 24576\n\t      wrl.nfs > sushi.1023: NFS reply xid 79658\n\t\t   reply ok 1472 read REG 100664 ids 417/0 sz 29388\n\n       (-v also prints the IP header TTL, ID, length, and fragmentation\n       fields, which have been omitted from this example.)  In the first line,\n       sushi asks wrl to read 8192 bytes from file 21,11/12.195, at byte\n       offset 24576.  Wrl replies `ok'; the packet shown on the second line is\n       the first fragment of the reply, and hence is only 1472 bytes long (the\n       other bytes will follow in subsequent fragments, but these fragments do\n       not have NFS or even UDP headers and so might not be printed, depending\n       on the filter expression used).\tBecause the -v flag is given, some of\n       the file attributes (which are returned in addition to the file data)\n       are printed: the file type (``REG'', for regular file), the file mode\n       (in octal), the UID and GID, and the file size.\n\n       If the -v flag is given more than once, even more details are printed.\n\n       NFS reply packets do not explicitly identify the RPC operation.\n       Instead, tcpdump keeps track of ``recent'' requests, and matches them\n       to the replies using the transaction ID.  If a reply does not closely\n       follow the corresponding request, it might not be parsable.\n\n       AFS Requests and Replies\n\n       Transarc AFS (Andrew File System) requests and replies are printed as:\n\n\t      src.sport > dst.dport: rx packet-type\n\t      src.sport > dst.dport: rx packet-type service call call-name args\n\t      src.sport > dst.dport: rx packet-type service reply call-name args\n\n\t      elvis.7001 > pike.afsfs:\n\t\t   rx data fs call rename old fid 536876964/1/1 \".newsrc.new\"\n\t\t   new fid 536876964/1/1 \".newsrc\"\n\t      pike.afsfs > elvis.7001: rx data fs reply rename\n\n       In the first line, host elvis sends a RX packet to pike.  This was a RX\n       data packet to the fs (fileserver) service, and is the start of an RPC\n       call.  The RPC call was a rename, with the old directory file id of\n       536876964/1/1 and an old filename of `.newsrc.new', and a new directory\n       file id of 536876964/1/1 and a new filename of `.newsrc'.  The host\n       pike responds with a RPC reply to the rename call (which was\n       successful, because it was a data packet and not an abort packet).\n\n       In general, all AFS RPCs are decoded at least by RPC call name.\tMost\n       AFS RPCs have at least some of the arguments decoded (generally only\n       the `interesting' arguments, for some definition of interesting).\n\n       The format is intended to be self-describing, but it will probably not\n       be useful to people who are not familiar with the workings of AFS and\n       RX.\n\n       If the -v (verbose) flag is given twice, acknowledgement packets and\n       additional header information is printed, such as the RX call ID, call\n       number, sequence number, serial number, and the RX packet flags.\n\n       If the -v flag is given twice, additional information is printed, such\n       as the RX call ID, serial number, and the RX packet flags.  The MTU\n       negotiation information is also printed from RX ack packets.\n\n       If the -v flag is given three times, the security index and service id\n       are printed.\n\n       Error codes are printed for abort packets, with the exception of Ubik\n       beacon packets (because abort packets are used to signify a yes vote\n       for the Ubik protocol).\n\n       AFS reply packets do not explicitly identify the RPC operation.\n       Instead, tcpdump keeps track of ``recent'' requests, and matches them\n       to the replies using the call number and service ID.  If a reply does\n       not closely follow the corresponding request, it might not be parsable."

    Manpage text:

    Some attempt should be made to reassemble IP fragments or, at least to
           compute the right length for the higher level protocol.

           Name server inverse queries are not dumped correctly: the (empty)
           question section is printed rather than real query in the answer
           section.  Some believe that inverse queries are themselves a bug and
           prefer to fix the program generating them rather than tcpdump.

           A packet trace that crosses a daylight savings time change will give
           skewed time stamps (the time change is ignored).

           Filter expressions on fields other than those in Token Ring headers
           will not correctly handle source-routed Token Ring packets.

           Filter expressions on fields other than those in 802.11 headers will
           not correctly handle 802.11 data packets with both To DS and From DS
           set.

           ip6 proto should chase header chain, but at this moment it does not.
           ip6 protochain is supplied for this behavior.

           Arithmetic expression against transport layer headers, like tcp[0],
           does not work against IPv6 packets.  It only looks at IPv4 packets.
