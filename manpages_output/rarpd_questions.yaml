Upon receiving a request, rarpd maps the target hardware\n     address to an IP address via its name, which must be present in both the\n     ethers(5) and hosts(5) databases.\tIf a host does not exist in both\n     databases, the translation cannot proceed and a reply will not be sent.\n\n     Additionally, a request is honored only if the server (i.e., the host\n     that rarpd is running on) can \"boot\" the target; that is, if the\n     directory /tftpboot/ipaddr exists, where is the target IP address.\n\n     In normal operation, rarpd forks a copy of itself and runs in the\n     background.  Anomalies and errors are reported via syslog(3).\n\nOPTIONS\n     -a      Listen on all the Ethernets attached to the system.  If ‘-a’ is\n\t     omitted, an interface must be specified."

  manpageQuestion3: What is the process for ensuring that rarpd can boot a target host when responding to Reverse ARP requests?
