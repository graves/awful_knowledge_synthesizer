If any\n       exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.\n\nDeprecations\n       There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.\n\nModules and Pragmata\n   New Modules and Pragmata\n       None\n\n   Updated Modules and Pragmata\n       •   B::Deparse has been upgraded from version 1.03 to 1.04, to address\n\t   two regressions in Perl 5.14.0:\n\n\t   Deparsing of the \"glob\" operator and its diamond (\"<>\") form now\n\t   works again. [perl #90898]\n\n\t   The presence of subroutines named \"::::\" or \"::::::\" no longer\n\t   causes B::Deparse to hang.\n\n       •   Pod::Perldoc has been upgraded from version 3.15_03 to 3.15_04.\n\n\t   It corrects the search paths on VMS. [perl #90640]\n\n   Removed Modules and Pragmata\n       None\n\nDocumentation\n   New Documentation\n       None\n\n   Changes to Existing Documentation\n       perlfunc\n\n       •   \"given\", \"when\" and \"default\" are now listed in perlfunc.\n\n       •   Documentation for \"use\" now includes a pointer to if.pm.\n\n       perllol\n\n       •   perllol has been expanded with examples using the new \"push\n\t   $scalar\" syntax introduced in Perl 5.14.0.\n\n       perlop\n\n       •   The explanation of bitwise operators has been expanded to explain\n\t   how they work on Unicode strings.\n\n       •   The section on the triple-dot or yada-yada operator has been moved\n\t   up, as it used to separate two closely related sections about the\n\t   comma operator.\n\n       •   More examples for \"m//g\" have been added.\n\n       •   The \"<<\\FOO\" here-doc syntax has been documented.\n\n       perlrun\n\n       •   perlrun has undergone a significant clean-up.  Most notably, the\n\t   -0x... form of the -0 flag has been clarified, and the final\n\t   section on environment variables has been corrected and expanded.\n\n       POSIX\n\n       •   The invocation documentation for \"WIFEXITED\", \"WEXITSTATUS\",\n\t   \"WIFSIGNALED\", \"WTERMSIG\", \"WIFSTOPPED\", and \"WSTOPSIG\" was\n\t   corrected.\n\nDiagnostics\n       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,\n       including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of\n       diagnostic messages, see perldiag.\n\n   New Diagnostics\n       None\n\n   Changes to Existing Diagnostics\n       None\n\nUtility Changes\n       None\n\nConfiguration and Compilation\n       •   regexp.h has been modified for compatibility with GCC's \"-Werror\"\n\t   option, as used by some projects that include perl's header files.\n\nTesting\n       •   Some test failures in dist/Locale-Maketext/t/09_compile.t that\n\t   could occur depending on the environment have been fixed. [perl\n\t   #89896]\n\n       •   A watchdog timer for t/re/re.t was lengthened to accommodate SH-4\n\t   systems which were unable to complete the tests before the previous\n\t   timer ran out.\n\nPlatform Support\n   New Platforms\n       None\n\n   Discontinued Platforms\n       None\n\n   Platform-Specific Notes\n       Solaris\n\n       •   Documentation listing the Solaris packages required to build Perl\n\t   on Solaris 9 and Solaris 10 has been corrected.\n\n       Mac OS X\n\n       •   The lib/locale.t test script has been updated to work on the\n\t   upcoming Lion release.\n\n       •   Mac OS X specific compilation instructions have been clarified.\n\n       Ubuntu Linux\n\n       •   The ODBM_File installation process has been updated with the new\n\t   library paths on Ubuntu natty.\n\nInternal Changes\n       •   The compiled representation of formats is now stored via the mg_ptr\n\t   of their PERL_MAGIC_fm. Previously it was stored in the string\n\t   buffer, beyond SvLEN(), the regular end of the string. SvCOMPILED()\n\t   and SvCOMPILED_{on,off}() now exist solely for compatibility for XS\n\t   code.  The first is always 0, the other two now no-ops.\n\nBug Fixes\n       •   A bug has been fixed that would cause a \"Use of freed value in\n\t   iteration\" error if the next two hash elements that would be\n\t   iterated over are deleted. [perl #85026]\n\n       •   Passing the same constant subroutine to both \"index\" and \"formline\"\n\t   no longer causes one or the other to fail. [perl #89218]\n\n       •   5.14.0 introduced some memory leaks in regular expression character\n\t   classes such as \"[\\w\\s]\", which have now been fixed.\n\n       •   An edge case in regular expression matching could potentially loop.\n\t   This happened only under \"/i\" in bracketed character classes that\n\t   have characters with multi-character folds, and the target string\n\t   to match against includes the first portion of the fold, followed\n\t   by another character that has a multi-character fold that begins\n\t   with the remaining portion of the fold, plus some more.\n\n\t    \"s\\N{U+DF}\" =~ /[\\x{DF}foo]/i\n\n\t   is one such case.  \"\\xDF\" folds to \"ss\".\n\n       •   Several Unicode case-folding bugs have been fixed.\n\n       •   The new (in 5.14.0) regular expression modifier \"/a\" when repeated\n\t   like \"/aa\" forbids the characters outside the ASCII range that\n\t   match characters inside that range from matching under \"/i\".  This\n\t   did not work under some circumstances, all involving alternation,\n\t   such as:\n\n\t    \"\\N{KELVIN SIGN}\" =~ /k|foo/iaa;\n\n\t   succeeded inappropriately.  This is now fixed.\n\n       •   Fixed a case where it was possible that a freed buffer may have\n\t   been read from when parsing a here document.\n\nAcknowledgements\n       Perl 5.14.1 represents approximately four weeks of development since\n       Perl 5.14.0 and contains approximately 3500 lines of changes across 38\n       files from 17 authors.\n\n       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant\n       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to\n       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.14.1:\n\n       Bo Lindbergh, Claudio Ramirez, Craig A. Berry, David Leadbeater, Father\n       Chrysostomos, Jesse Vincent, Jim Cromie, Justin Case, Karl Williamson,\n       Leo Lapworth, Nicholas Clark, Nobuhiro Iwamatsu, smash, Tom\n       Christiansen, Ton Hospel, Vladimir Timofeev, and Zsban Ambrus.\n\nReporting Bugs\n       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles\n       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug\n       database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be\n       information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.\n\n       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug\n       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a\n       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output\n       of \"perl -V\", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by\n       the Perl porting team.\n\n       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it\n       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please\n       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed\n       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core\n       committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out\n       a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate\n       or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.\n       Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not\n       for modules independently distributed on CPAN.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for an explanation of how to view exhaustive details\n       on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t      PERL5141DELTA(1)"
