These log files should be\n     written to backup media to provide for recovery in the case of\n     catastrophic failure (which also requires a snapshot of the database\n     files), but they may then be deleted from the system to reclaim disk\n     space.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -a\n       Write all pathnames as absolute pathnames, instead of relative to the\n       database home directories.\n\n     -d\n       Remove log files that are no longer needed; no filenames are written.\n       Automatic log file removal is likely to make catastrophic recovery\n       impossible.\n\n     -h\n       Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the\n       current working directory is used."

    Manpage text:

    -l
           Write out the pathnames of all the database log files, whether or not
           they are involved in active transactions.

         -P
           Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities
           overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a
           window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see
           command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the
           memory containing the command-line arguments.

         -s
           Write the pathnames of all the database files that need to be archived
           in order to recover the database from catastrophic failure. If any of
           the database files have not been accessed during the lifetime of the
           current log files, db_archive will not include them in this output.

           It is possible that some of the files to which the log refers have
           since been deleted from the system. In this case, db_archive will
           ignore them. When db_recover is run, any files to which the log refers
           that are not present during recovery are assumed to have been deleted
           and will not be recovered.

    Manpage text:

    -V
           Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

         -v
           Run in verbose mode, listing the checkpoints in the log files as they
           are reviewed.

         Log cursor handles (returned by the DB_ENV->log_cursor method) may have
         open file descriptors for log files in the database environment. Also,
         the Berkeley DB interfaces to the database environment logging subsystem
         (for example, DB_ENV->log_put and DB_TXN->abort) may allocate log cursors
         and have open file descriptors for log files as well. On operating
         systems where filesystem related system calls (for example, rename and
         unlink on Windows/NT) can fail if a process has an open file descriptor
         for the affected file, attempting to move or remove the log files listed
         by db_archive may fail. All Berkeley DB internal use of log cursors
         operates on active log files only and furthermore, is short-lived in
         nature. So, an application seeing such a failure should be restructured
         to close any open log cursors it may have, and otherwise to retry the
         operation until it succeeds. (Although the latter is not likely to be
         necessary; it is hard to imagine a reason to move or rename a log file in
         which transactions are being logged or aborted.)

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `db_archive`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe db_archive utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for\n     the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility\n     was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment).
