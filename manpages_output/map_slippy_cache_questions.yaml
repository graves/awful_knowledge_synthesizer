  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the map::slippy::cache command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you create a tile cache named 'myMapCache' that stores tiles in '/Users/username/tiles' and uses a provider command 'http://example.com/tile?z={z}&x={x}&y={y}'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of checking if a specific tile (z=12, x=3456, y=7890) exists in the 'myMapCache' cache?
