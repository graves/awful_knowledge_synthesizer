    Manpage text:

    -h
           Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the
           current working directory is used.

         -k
           Dump record numbers from Queue and Recno databases as keys.

         -l
           List the databases stored in the file.

         -N
           Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running. Other problems,
           such as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as
           well. This option is intended only for debugging errors, and should not
           be used under any other circumstances.

         -P
           Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities
           overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a
           window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see
           command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the
           memory containing the command-line arguments.

         -p
           If characters in either the key or data items are printing characters
           (as defined by isprint(3)), use printing characters in file to
           represent them. This option permits users to use standard text editors
           and tools to modify the contents of databases.

    Manpage text:

    Note: different systems may have different notions about what
           characters are considered printing characters, and databases dumped in
           this manner may be less portable to external systems.

         -R
           Aggressively salvage data from a possibly corrupt file. The -R flag
           differs from the -r option in that it will return all possible data
           from the file at the risk of also returning already deleted or
           otherwise nonsensical items. Data dumped in this fashion will almost
           certainly have to be edited by hand or other means before the data is
           ready for reload into another database

         -r
           Salvage data from a possibly corrupt file. When used on a uncorrupted
           database, this option should return equivalent data to a normal dump,
           but most likely in a different order.

         -s
           Specify a single database to dump. If no database is specified, all
           databases in the database file are dumped.

         -V
           Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

    Manpage text:

    Dumping and reloading Hash databases that use user-defined hash functions
         will result in new databases that use the default hash function. Although
         using the default hash function may not be optimal for the new database,
         it will continue to work correctly.

         Dumping and reloading Btree databases that use user-defined prefix or
         comparison functions will result in new databases that use the default
         prefix and comparison functions.  In this case, it is quite likely that
         the database will be damaged beyond repair permitting neither record
         storage or retrieval.

         The only available workaround for either case is to modify the sources
         for the db_load utility to load the database using the correct hash,
         prefix, and comparison functions.

         The db_dump utility output format is documented in the Dump Output
         Formats section of the Berkeley DB Reference Guide.

         The db_dump utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as
         described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because
         the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment).
         In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB
         environment, db_dump should always be given the chance to detach from the
         environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_dump to release all
         environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal
         (SIGINT).
