Current Perl's should handle this problem correctly.  Older\n       threaded Perls (5.8.6 or earlier) will run into this problem.  If you\n       want to run a threaded Perl on OpenBSD 3.7 or higher, you will need to\n       upgrade to at least Perl 5.8.7.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Steve Peters <steve@fisharerojo.org>\n\n       Please report any errors, updates, or suggestions to\n       <https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t\tPERLOPENBSD(1)"
