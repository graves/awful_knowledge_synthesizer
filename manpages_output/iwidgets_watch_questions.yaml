This command may be used to invoke various operations on the\n       widget. It has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command. The\n       following commands are possible for watch widgets:\n\n\nWIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS\n       pathName cget option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::watch command.\n\n       pathName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.\tIf no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list).\tIf option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the\n\t      given value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty\n\t      string.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the\n\t      iwidgets::watch command.\n\n       pathName get ?format?\n\t      Returns the current time of the watch in a format of string or\n\t      as an integer clock value using the -string and -clicks format\n\t      options respectively.  The default is by string.\tReference the\n\t      clock command for more information on obtaining time and its\n\t      formats.\n\n       pathName show time\n\t      Changes the currently displayed time to be that of the time\n\t      argument.  The time may be specified either as a string, an\n\t      integer clock value or the keyword \"now\".  Reference the clock\n\t      command for more information on obtaining time and its format.\n\n       pathName watch ?args?\n\t      Evaluates the specifieds args against the canvas component."
