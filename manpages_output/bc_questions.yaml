(See the STANDARDS section.)  The language provides\n       unlimited precision decimal arithmetic and is somewhat C-like, but\n       there are differences.  Such differences will be noted in this\n       document.\n\n       After parsing and handling options, this bc(1) reads any files given on\n       the command line and executes them before reading from stdin.\n\n       This bc(1) is a drop-in replacement for any bc(1), including (and\n       especially) the GNU bc(1).  It also has many extensions and extra\n       features beyond other implementations.\n\n       Note: If running this bc(1) on any script meant for another bc(1) gives\n       a parse error, it is probably because a word this bc(1) reserves as a\n       keyword is used as the name of a function, variable, or array.  To fix\n       that, use the command-line option -r keyword, where keyword is the\n       keyword that is used as a name in the script.  For more information,\n       see the OPTIONS section.\n\n       If parsing scripts meant for other bc(1) implementations still does not\n       work, that is a bug and should be reported.  See the BUGS section.\n\nOPTIONS\n       The following are the options that bc(1) accepts.\n\n       -C, --no-digit-clamp\n\t      Disables clamping of digits greater than or equal to the current\n\t      ibase when parsing numbers.\n\n\t      This means that the value added to a number from a digit is\n\t      always that digit’s value multiplied by the value of ibase\n\t      raised to the power of the digit’s position, which starts from 0\n\t      at the least significant digit.\n\n\t      If this and/or the -c or --digit-clamp options are given\n\t      multiple times, the last one given is used.\n\n\t      This option overrides the BC_DIGIT_CLAMP environment variable\n\t      (see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section) and the default, which\n\t      can be queried with the -h or --help options.\n\n\t      This is a non-portable extension.\n\n       -c, --digit-clamp\n\t      Enables clamping of digits greater than or equal to the current\n\t      ibase when parsing numbers.\n\n\t      This means that digits that the value added to a number from a\n\t      digit that is greater than or equal to the ibase is the value of\n\t      ibase minus 1 all multiplied by the value of ibase raised to the\n\t      power of the digit’s position, which starts from 0 at the least\n\t      significant digit.\n\n\t      If this and/or the -C or --no-digit-clamp options are given\n\t      multiple times, the last one given is used.\n\n\t      This option overrides the BC_DIGIT_CLAMP environment variable\n\t      (see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section) and the default, which\n\t      can be queried with the -h or --help options.\n\n\t      This is a non-portable extension.\n\n       -E seed, --seed=seed\n\t      Sets the builtin variable seed to the value seed assuming that\n\t      seed is in base 10.  It is a fatal error if seed is not a valid\n\t      number.\n\n\t      If multiple instances of this option are given, the last is\n\t      used.\n\n\t      This is a non-portable extension.\n\n       -e expr, --expression=expr\n\t      Evaluates expr.  If multiple expressions are given, they are\n\t      evaluated in order.  If files are given as well (see the -f and\n\t      --file options), the expressions and files are evaluated in the\n\t      order given.  This means that if a file is given before an\n\t      expression, the file is read in and evaluated first.\n\n\t      If this option is given on the command-line (i.e., not in\n\t      BC_ENV_ARGS, see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section), then after\n\t      processing all expressions and files, bc(1) will exit, unless -\n\t      (stdin) was given as an argument at least once to -f or --file,\n\t      whether on the command-line or in BC_ENV_ARGS.  However, if any\n\t      other -e, --expression, -f, or --file arguments are given after\n\t      -f- or equivalent is given, bc(1) will give a fatal error and\n\t      exit.\n\n\t      This is a non-portable extension.\n\n       -f file, --file=file\n\t      Reads in file and evaluates it, line by line, as though it were\n\t      read through stdin.  If expressions are also given (see the -e\n\t      and --expression options), the expressions are evaluated in the\n\t      order given.\n\n\t      If this option is given on the command-line (i.e., not in\n\t      BC_ENV_ARGS, see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section), then after\n\t      processing all expressions and files, bc(1) will exit, unless -\n\t      (stdin) was given as an argument at least once to -f or --file.\n\t      However, if any other -e, --expression, -f, or --file arguments\n\t      are given after -f- or equivalent is given, bc(1) will give a\n\t      fatal error and exit.\n\n\t      This is a non-portable extension.\n\n       -g, --global-stacks\n\t      Turns the globals ibase, obase, scale, and seed into stacks.\n\n\t      This has the effect that a copy of the current value of all four\n\t      are pushed onto a stack for every function call, as well as\n\t      popped when every function returns.  This means that functions\n\t      can assign to any and all of those globals without worrying that\n\t      the change will affect other functions.  Thus, a hypothetical\n\t      function named output(x,b) that simply printed x in base b could\n\t      be written like this:"

There are two possible use cases\n\t      for that, and each has a solution.\n\n\t      First, if a function is called on startup to turn bc(1) into a\n\t      number converter, it is possible to replace that capability with\n\t      various shell aliases.  Examples:\n\n\n\t\t     alias d2o=\"bc -e ibase=A -e obase=8\"\n\t\t     alias h2b=\"bc -e ibase=G -e obase=2\"\n\n\n\t      Second, if the purpose of a function is to set ibase, obase,\n\t      scale, or seed globally for any other purpose, it could be split\n\t      into one to four functions (based on how many globals it sets)\n\t      and each of those functions could return the desired value for a\n\t      global.\n\n\t      For functions that set seed, the value assigned to seed is not\n\t      propagated to parent functions.  This means that the sequence of\n\t      pseudo-random numbers that they see will not be the same\n\t      sequence of pseudo-random numbers that any parent sees.  This is\n\t      only the case once seed has been set.\n\n\t      If a function desires to not affect the sequence of pseudo-\n\t      random numbers of its parents, but wants to use the same seed,\n\t      it can use the following line:"

However, if seed does return a\n       different value, both values, when assigned to seed, are guaranteed to\n       produce the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers.  This means that\n       certain values assigned to seed will not produce unique sequences of\n       pseudo-random numbers.  The value of seed will change after any use of\n       the rand() and irand(E) operands (see the Operands subsection below),\n       except if the parameter passed to irand(E) is 0, 1, or negative.\n\n       There is no limit to the length (number of significant decimal digits)\n       or scale of the value that can be assigned to seed.\n\n       Variables and arrays do not interfere; users can have arrays named the\n       same as variables.  This also applies to functions (see the FUNCTIONS\n       section), so a user can have a variable, array, and function that all\n       have the same name, and they will not shadow each other, whether inside\n       of functions or not.\n\n       Named expressions are required as the operand of increment/decrement\n       operators and as the left side of assignment operators (see the\n       Operators subsection).\n\n   Operands\n       The following are valid operands in bc(1):\n\n\t1. Numbers (see the Numbers subsection below).\n\n\t2. Array indices (I[E]).\n\n\t3. (E): The value of E (used to change precedence).\n\n\t4. sqrt(E): The square root of E.  E must be non-negative.\n\n\t5. length(E): The number of significant decimal digits in E.  Returns\n\t   1 for 0 with no decimal places.  If given a string, the length of\n\t   the string is returned.  Passing a string to length(E) is a non-\n\t   portable extension.\n\n\t6. length(I[]): The number of elements in the array I.\tThis is a non-\n\t   portable extension.\n\n\t7. scale(E): The scale of E.\n\n\t8. abs(E): The absolute value of E.

This is a non-portable extension.\n\n       11. modexp(E, E, E): Modular exponentiation, where the first expression\n\t   is the base, the second is the exponent, and the third is the\n\t   modulus.  All three values must be integers.  The second argument\n\t   must be non-negative.  The third argument must be non-zero.\tThis\n\t   is a non-portable extension.\n\n       12. divmod(E, E, I[]): Division and modulus in one operation.  This is\n\t   for optimization.  The first expression is the dividend, and the\n\t   second is the divisor, which must be non-zero.  The return value is\n\t   the quotient, and the modulus is stored in index 0 of the provided\n\t   array (the last argument).  This is a non-portable extension.\n\n       13. asciify(E): If E is a string, returns a string that is the first\n\t   letter of its argument.  If it is a number, calculates the number\n\t   mod 256 and returns that number as a one-character string.  This is\n\t   a non-portable extension.\n\n       14. asciify(I[]): A string that is made up of the characters that would\n\t   result from running asciify(E) on each element of the array\n\t   identified by the argument.\tThis allows creating multi-character\n\t   strings and storing them.

This is a non-portable extension.\n\n       21. global_stacks(): 0 if global stacks are not enabled with the -g or\n\t   --global-stacks options, non-zero otherwise.  See the OPTIONS\n\t   section.  This is a non-portable extension.\n\n       22. leading_zero(): 0 if leading zeroes are not enabled with the -z or\n\t   –leading-zeroes options, non-zero otherwise.  See the OPTIONS\n\t   section.  This is a non-portable extension.\n\n       23. rand(): A pseudo-random integer between 0 (inclusive) and\n\t   BC_RAND_MAX (inclusive).  Using this operand will change the value\n\t   of seed.  This is a non-portable extension.\n\n       24. irand(E): A pseudo-random integer between 0 (inclusive) and the\n\t   value of E (exclusive).  If E is negative or is a non-integer (E’s\n\t   scale is not 0), an error is raised, and bc(1) resets (see the\n\t   RESET section) while seed remains unchanged.  If E is larger than\n\t   BC_RAND_MAX, the higher bound is honored by generating several\n\t   pseudo-random integers, multiplying them by appropriate powers of\n\t   BC_RAND_MAX+1, and adding them together.  Thus, the size of integer\n\t   that can be generated with this operand is unbounded.  Using this\n\t   operand will change the value of seed, unless the value of E is 0\n\t   or 1.  In that case, 0 is returned, and seed is not changed.  This\n\t   is a non-portable extension.\n\n       25. maxrand(): The max integer returned by rand().  This is a non-\n\t   portable extension.\n\n       The integers generated by rand() and irand(E) are guaranteed to be as\n       unbiased as possible, subject to the limitations of the pseudo-random\n       number generator.\n\n       Note: The values returned by the pseudo-random number generator with\n       rand() and irand(E) are guaranteed to NOT be cryptographically secure.\n       This is a consequence of using a seeded pseudo-random number generator.\n       However, they are guaranteed to be reproducible with identical seed\n       values.\tThis means that the pseudo-random values from bc(1) should\n       only be used where a reproducible stream of pseudo-random numbers is\n       ESSENTIAL.  In any other case, use a non-seeded pseudo-random number\n       generator.\n\n   Numbers\n       Numbers are strings made up of digits, uppercase letters, and at most 1\n       period for a radix.  Numbers can have up to BC_NUM_MAX digits.\n       Uppercase letters are equal to 9 plus their position in the alphabet,\n       starting from 1 (i.e., A equals 10, or 9+1).\n\n       If a digit or letter makes no sense with the current value of ibase\n       (i.e., they are greater than or equal to the current value of ibase),\n       then the behavior depends on the existence of the -c/--digit-clamp or\n       -C/--no-digit-clamp options (see the OPTIONS section), the existence\n       and setting of the BC_DIGIT_CLAMP environment variable (see the\n       ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section), or the default, which can be queried\n       with the -h/--help option.\n\n       If clamping is off, then digits or letters that are greater than or\n       equal to the current value of ibase are not changed.  Instead, their\n       given value is multiplied by the appropriate power of ibase and added\n       into the number.  This means that, with an ibase of 3, the number AB is\n       equal to 3^1*A+3^0*B, which is 3 times 10 plus 11, or 41.\n\n       If clamping is on, then digits or letters that are greater than or\n       equal to the current value of ibase are set to the value of the highest\n       valid digit in ibase before being multiplied by the appropriate power\n       of ibase and added into the number.  This means that, with an ibase of\n       3, the number AB is equal to 3^1*2+3^0*2, which is 3 times 2 plus 2, or\n       8.\n\n       There is one exception to clamping: single-character numbers (i.e., A\n       alone).\tSuch numbers are never clamped and always take the value they\n       would have in the highest possible ibase.  This means that A alone\n       always equals decimal 10 and Z alone always equals decimal 35.  This\n       behavior is mandated by the standard (see the STANDARDS section) and is\n       meant to provide an easy way to set the current ibase (with the i\n       command) regardless of the current value of ibase.\n\n       If clamping is on, and the clamped value of a character is needed, use\n       a leading zero, i.e., for A, use 0A.\n\n       In addition, bc(1) accepts numbers in scientific notation.  These have\n       the form <number>e<integer>.  The exponent (the portion after the e)\n       must be an integer.  An example is 1.89237e9, which is equal to\n       1892370000.  Negative exponents are also allowed, so 4.2890e-3 is equal\n       to 0.0042890.\n\n       Using scientific notation is an error or warning if the -s or -w,\n       respectively, command-line options (or equivalents) are given.\n\n       WARNING: Both the number and the exponent in scientific notation are\n       interpreted according to the current ibase, but the number is still\n       multiplied by 10^exponent regardless of the current ibase.  For\n       example, if ibase is 16 and bc(1) is given the number string FFeA, the\n       resulting decimal number will be 2550000000000, and if bc(1) is given\n       the number string 10e-4, the resulting decimal number will be 0.0016.\n\n       Accepting input as scientific notation is a non-portable extension.\n\n   Operators\n       The following arithmetic and logical operators can be used.  They are\n       listed in order of decreasing precedence.  Operators in the same group\n       have the same precedence.\n\n       ++ --  Type: Prefix and Postfix\n\n\t      Associativity: None\n\n\t      Description: increment, decrement\n\n       - !

    Manpage text:

    for (i = 0; i < 3; ++i) i; quit


           Other bc(1) implementations will print nothing, and this bc(1) will
           print 0, 1, and 2 on successive lines before exiting.

           The halt statement causes bc(1) to quit, if it is executed.  (Unlike
           quit if it is on a branch of an if statement that is not executed,
           bc(1) does not quit.)

           The limits statement prints the limits that this bc(1) is subject to.
           This is like the quit statement in that it is a compile-time command.

           An expression by itself is evaluated and printed, followed by a
           newline.

           Both scientific notation and engineering notation are available for
           printing the results of expressions.  Scientific notation is activated
           by assigning 0 to obase, and engineering notation is activated by
           assigning 1 to obase.  To deactivate them, just assign a different
           value to obase.

           Scientific notation and engineering notation are disabled if bc(1) is
           run with either the -s or -w command-line options (or equivalents).

           Printing numbers in scientific notation and/or engineering notation is
           a non-portable extension.

       Strings
           If strings appear as a statement by themselves, they are printed
           without a trailing newline.

           In addition to appearing as a lone statement by themselves, strings can
           be assigned to variables and array elements.  They can also be passed
           to functions in variable parameters.

           If any statement that expects a string is given a variable that had a
           string assigned to it, the statement acts as though it had received a
           string.

           If any math operation is attempted on a string or a variable or array
           element that has been assigned a string, an error is raised, and bc(1)
           resets (see the RESET section).

           Assigning strings to variables and array elements and passing them to
           functions are non-portable extensions.

       Print Statement
           The “expressions” in a print statement may also be strings.  If they
           are, there are backslash escape sequences that are interpreted
           specially.  What those sequences are, and what they cause to be
           printed, are shown below:

           \a: \a

           \b: \b

           \\: \

           \e: \

           \f: \f

           \n: \n

           \q: “

           \r: \r

           \t: \t

           Any other character following a backslash causes the backslash and
           character to be printed as-is.

           Any non-string expression in a print statement shall be assigned to
           last, like any other expression that is printed.

       Stream Statement
           The “expressions in a stream statement may also be strings.

           If a stream statement is given a string, it prints the string as though
           the string had appeared as its own statement.  In other words, the
           stream statement prints strings normally, without a newline.

           If a stream statement is given a number, a copy of it is truncated and
           its absolute value is calculated.  The result is then printed as though
           obase is 256 and each digit is interpreted as an 8-bit ASCII character,
           making it a byte stream.

       Order of Evaluation
           All expressions in a statment are evaluated left to right, except as
           necessary to maintain order of operations.  This means, for example,
           assuming that i is equal to 0, in the expression

    Manpage text:

    INTERACTIVE MODE
           Per the standard (see the STANDARDS section), bc(1) has an interactive
           mode and a non-interactive mode.  Interactive mode is turned on
           automatically when both stdin and stdout are hooked to a terminal, but
           the -i flag and --interactive option can turn it on in other
           situations.

           In interactive mode, bc(1) attempts to recover from errors (see the
           RESET section), and in normal execution, flushes stdout as soon as
           execution is done for the current input.  bc(1) may also reset on
           SIGINT instead of exit, depending on the contents of, or default for,
           the BC_SIGINT_RESET environment variable (see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
           section).

    TTY MODE
           If stdin, stdout, and stderr are all connected to a TTY, then “TTY
           mode” is considered to be available, and thus, bc(1) can turn on TTY
           mode, subject to some settings.

           If there is the environment variable BC_TTY_MODE in the environment
           (see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section), then if that environment

    Manpage text:

    However, if BC_PROMPT does not exist, the prompt can be enabled or
           disabled with the BC_TTY_MODE environment variable, the -P and --no-
           prompt options, and the -R and --no-read-prompt options.  See the
           ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES and OPTIONS sections for more details.

    SIGNAL HANDLING
           Sending a SIGINT will cause bc(1) to do one of two things.

           If bc(1) is not in interactive mode (see the INTERACTIVE MODE section),
           or the BC_SIGINT_RESET environment variable (see the ENVIRONMENT
           VARIABLES section), or its default, is either not an integer or it is
           zero, bc(1) will exit.

           However, if bc(1) is in interactive mode, and the BC_SIGINT_RESET or
           its default is an integer and non-zero, then bc(1) will stop executing
           the current input and reset (see the RESET section) upon receiving a
           SIGINT.

           Note that “current input” can mean one of two things.  If bc(1) is
           processing input from stdin in interactive mode, it will ask for more
           input.  If bc(1) is processing input from a file in interactive mode,
           it will stop processing the file and start processing the next file, if
           one exists, or ask for input from stdin if no other file exists.

    Manpage text:

    This means that if a SIGINT is sent to bc(1) as it is executing a file,
           it can seem as though bc(1) did not respond to the signal since it will
           immediately start executing the next file.  This is by design; most
           files that users execute when interacting with bc(1) have function
           definitions, which are quick to parse.  If a file takes a long time to
           execute, there may be a bug in that file.  The rest of the files could
           still be executed without problem, allowing the user to continue.

           SIGTERM and SIGQUIT cause bc(1) to clean up and exit, and it uses the
           default handler for all other signals.  The one exception is SIGHUP; in
           that case, and only when bc(1) is in TTY mode (see the TTY MODE
           section), a SIGHUP will cause bc(1) to clean up and exit.

    COMMAND LINE HISTORY
           bc(1) supports interactive command-line editing.

           If bc(1) can be in TTY mode (see the TTY MODE section), history can be
           enabled.  This means that command-line history can only be enabled when
           stdin, stdout, and stderr are all connected to a TTY.

    Manpage text:

    Like TTY mode itself, it can be turned on or off with the environment
           variable BC_TTY_MODE (see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section).

           If history is enabled, previous lines can be recalled and edited with
           the arrow keys.

           Note: tabs are converted to 8 spaces.

    LOCALES
           This bc(1) ships with support for adding error messages for different
           locales and thus, supports LC_MESSAGES.

    STANDARDS
           bc(1) is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2017 (“POSIX.1-2017”)
           specification at
           https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/bc.html .
           The flags -efghiqsvVw, all long options, and the extensions noted above
           are extensions to that specification.

           In addition, the behavior of the quit implements an interpretation of
           that specification that is different from all known implementations.
           For more information see the Statements subsection of the SYNTAX
           section.

           Note that the specification explicitly says that bc(1) only accepts
           numbers that use a period (.) as a radix point, regardless of the value
           of LC_NUMERIC.
