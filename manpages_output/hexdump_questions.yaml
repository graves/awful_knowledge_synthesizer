Display the input offset in hexadecimal,\n\t     followed by sixteen space-separated, three column, zero-filled,\n\t     bytes of input data, in octal, per line.\n\n     -c      One-byte character display.  Display the input offset in\n\t     hexadecimal, followed by sixteen space-separated, three column,\n\t     space-filled, characters of input data per line.\n\n     -C      Canonical hex+ASCII display.  Display the input offset in\n\t     hexadecimal, followed by sixteen space-separated, two column,\n\t     hexadecimal bytes, followed by the same sixteen bytes in %_p\n\t     format enclosed in ``|'' characters."

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `hexdump`.



    Manpage text:

    The input is manipulated in ``blocks'', where a block is defined as the
         largest amount of data specified by any format string.  Format strings
         interpreting less than an input block's worth of data, whose last format
         unit both interprets some number of bytes and does not have a specified
         iteration count, have the iteration count incremented until the entire
         input block has been processed or there is not enough data remaining in
         the block to satisfy the format string.

         If, either as a result of user specification or hexdump modifying the
         iteration count as described above, an iteration count is greater than
         one, no trailing whitespace characters are output during the last
         iteration.

         It is an error to specify a byte count as well as multiple conversion
         characters or strings unless all but one of the conversion characters or
         strings is _a or _A.

         If, as a result of the specification of the -n option or end-of-file
         being reached, input data only partially satisfies a format string, the
         input block is zero-padded sufficiently to display all available data
         (i.e., any format units overlapping the end of data will display some
         number of the zero bytes).
