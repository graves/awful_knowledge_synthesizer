The overlay can be used with any backend that maintains\n       entryCSN and entryUUID attributes for its entries. It also creates a\n       contextCSN attribute in the root entry of the database.\n\n       The contextCSN is updated for every write operation performed against\n       the database. To reduce database contention, the contextCSN is only\n       updated in memory. The value is written to the database on server\n       shutdown and read into memory on startup, and maintained in memory\n       thereafter. Checkpoints may be configured to write the contextCSN into\n       the underlying database to minimize recovery time after an unclean\n       shutdown."
