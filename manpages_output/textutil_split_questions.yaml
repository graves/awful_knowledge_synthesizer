The\n\t      argument len defaults to 1 if none is specified. A negative\n\t      length is not allowed and will cause the command to throw an\n\t      error. Providing an empty string as input is allowed, the\n\t      command will then return an empty list. If the length of the\n\t      string is not an entire multiple of the chunk length, then the\n\t      last chunk in the generated list will be shorter than len."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `textutil_split`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n::textutil::split::splitx string ?regexp?\n\t      This command splits the string and return a list. The string is\n\t      split according to the regular expression regexp instead of a\n\t      simple list of chars.  Note that if you parentheses are added\n\t      into the regexp, the parentheses part of separator will be added\n\t      into the result list as additional element. If the string is\n\t      empty the result is the empty list, like for split. If regexp is\n\t      empty the string is split at every character, like split does.\n\t      The regular expression regexp defaults to \"[\\\\t \\\\r\\\\n]+\".\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
