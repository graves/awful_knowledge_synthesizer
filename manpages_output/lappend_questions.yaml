Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `lappend`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nlappend(n)\t\t     Tcl Built-In Commands\t\t    lappend(n)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nNAME\n       lappend - Append list elements onto a variable\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       lappend varName ?value value value ...?\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This command treats the variable given by varName as a list and appends\n       each of the value arguments to that list as a separate element, with\n       spaces between elements.  If varName does not exist, it is created as a\n       list with elements given by the value arguments.  Lappend is similar to\n       append except that the values are appended as list elements rather than\n       raw text.  This command provides a relatively efficient way to build up\n       large lists.  For example, “lappend a $b” is much more efficient than\n       “set a [concat $a [list $b]]” when $a is long.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       Using lappend to build up a list of numbers.\n\t      % set var 1\n\t      1\n\t      % lappend var 2\n\t      1 2\n\t      % lappend var 3 4 5\n\t      1 2 3 4 5"
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the lappend command in Tcl?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the lappend command to add the numbers 5, 6, and 7 to an existing list stored in a variable named 'numbers'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the lappend command to create a new list containing the elements 'apple', 'banana', and 'orange'?
