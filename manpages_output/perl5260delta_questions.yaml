    "POSIX::tmpnam()" has been removed
           The fundamentally unsafe "tmpnam()" interface was deprecated in Perl
           5.22 and has now been removed.  In its place, you can use, for example,
           the File::Temp interfaces.

       require ::Foo::Bar is now illegal.
           Formerly, "require ::Foo::Bar" would try to read /Foo/Bar.pm.  Now any
           bareword require which starts with a double colon dies instead.

       Literal control character variable names are no longer permissible
           A variable name may no longer contain a literal control character under
           any circumstances.  These previously were allowed in single-character
           names on ASCII platforms, but have been deprecated there since Perl
           5.20.  This affects things like "$\cT", where \cT is a literal control
           (such as a "NAK" or "NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGE" character) in the source
           code.

       "NBSP" is no longer permissible in "\N{...}"
           The name of a character may no longer contain non-breaking spaces.  It
           has been deprecated to do so since Perl 5.22.

    Deprecations
       String delimiters that aren't stand-alone graphemes are now deprecated
           For Perl to eventually allow string delimiters to be Unicode grapheme
           clusters (which look like a single character, but may be a sequence of
           several ones), we have to stop allowing a single character delimiter
           that isn't a grapheme by itself.  These are unlikely to exist in actual
           code, as they would typically display as attached to the character in
           front of them.

       "\cX" that maps to a printable is no longer deprecated
           This means we have no plans to remove this feature.  It still raises a
           warning, but only if syntax warnings are enabled.  The feature was
           originally intended to be a way to express non-printable characters
           that don't have a mnemonic ("\t" and "\n" are mnemonics for two non-
           printable characters, but most non-printables don't have a mnemonic.)
           But the feature can be used to specify a few printable characters,
           though those are more clearly expressed as the printable itself.  See
           <http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2017/02/msg242944.html>.

When \"re 'strict'\" is enabled, a warning now will be\n\t   generated for all unescaped uses of the two characters \"}\" and \"]\"\n\t   in regular expression patterns (outside bracketed character\n\t   classes) that are taken literally.  This brings them more in line\n\t   with the \")\" character which is always a metacharacter unless\n\t   escaped.  Being a metacharacter only sometimes, depending on an\n\t   action at a distance, can lead to silently having the pattern mean\n\t   something quite different than was intended, which the\n\t   \"re 'strict'\" mode is intended to minimize."

    Obituary
           Jon Portnoy (AVENJ), a prolific Perl author and admired Gentoo
           community member, has passed away on August 10, 2016.  He will be
           remembered and missed by all those who he came in contact with, and
           enriched with his intellect, wit, and spirit.

           It is with great sadness that we also note Kip Hampton's passing.
           Probably best known as the author of the Perl & XML column on XML.com,
           he was a core contributor to AxKit, an XML server platform that became
           an Apache Foundation project.  He was a frequent speaker in the early
           days at OSCON, and most recently at YAPC::NA in Madison.  He was
           frequently on irc.perl.org as ubu, generally in the #axkit-dahut
           community, the group responsible for YAPC::NA Asheville in 2011.

           Kip and his constant contributions to the community will be greatly
           missed.

We're grateful to the entire CPAN\n       community for helping Perl to flourish.\n\n       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,\n       please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.\n\nReporting Bugs\n       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug\n       database at <https://rt.perl.org/>.  There may also be information at\n       <http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.\n\n       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug\n       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a\n       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output\n       of \"perl -V\", will be sent off to \"perlbug@perl.org\" to be analysed by\n       the Perl porting team."
