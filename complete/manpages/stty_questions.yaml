If no options or arguments are\n     specified, it reports the settings of a subset of characteristics as well\n     as additional ones if they differ from their default values.  Otherwise\n     it modifies the terminal state according to the specified arguments.\n     Some combinations of arguments are mutually exclusive on some terminal\n     types.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -a      Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard\n\t     output as per IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”).\n\n     -e      Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard\n\t     output in the traditional BSD ``all'' and ``everything'' formats.\n\n     -f      Open and use the terminal named by file rather than using\n\t     standard input.  The file is opened using the O_NONBLOCK flag of\n\t     open(), making it possible to set or display settings on a\n\t     terminal that might otherwise block on the open.\n\n     -g      Display all the current settings for the terminal to standard\n\t     output in a form that may be used as an argument to a subsequent\n\t     invocation of stty to restore the current terminal state as per\n\t     IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”).\n\n     The following arguments are available to set the terminal\n     characteristics:\n\n   Control Modes:\n     Control mode flags affect hardware characteristics associated with the\n     terminal.\tThis corresponds to the c_cflag in the termios structure.\n\n     number\t Set terminal baud rate to the number given, if possible.  If\n\t\t the baud rate is set to zero, modem control is no longer\n\t\t asserted.\n\n     clocal (-clocal)\n\t\t Assume a line without (with) modem control.\n\n     cread (-cread)\n\t\t Enable (disable) the receiver.\n\n     crtscts (-crtscts)\n\t\t Enable (disable) RTS/CTS flow control.\n\n     cs5 cs6 cs7 cs8\n\t\t Select character size, if possible.\n\n     cstopb (-cstopb)\n\t\t Use two (one) stop bits per character.\n\n     hup (-hup)  Same as hupcl (-hupcl).\n\n     hupcl (-hupcl)\n\t\t Stop asserting modem control (do not stop asserting modem\n\t\t control) on last close.\n\n     ispeed number\n\t\t Set terminal input baud rate to the number given, if\n\t\t possible.  If the input baud rate is set to zero, the input\n\t\t baud rate is set to the value of the output baud rate.\n\n     ospeed number\n\t\t Set terminal output baud rate to the number given, if\n\t\t possible.  If the output baud rate is set to zero, modem\n\t\t control is no longer asserted.\n\n     parenb (-parenb)\n\t\t Enable (disable) parity generation and detection.\n\n     parodd (-parodd)\n\t\t Select odd (even) parity.\n\n     speed number\n\t\t This sets both ispeed and ospeed to number.\n\n   Input Modes:\n     This corresponds to the c_iflag in the termios structure.\n\n     brkint (-brkint)\n\t\t Signal (do not signal) INTR on break.\n\n     icrnl (-icrnl)\n\t\t Map (do not map) CR to NL on input.\n\n     ignbrk (-ignbrk)\n\t\t Ignore (do not ignore) break on input.\n\n     igncr (-igncr)\n\t\t Ignore (do not ignore) CR on input.\n\n     ignpar (-ignpar)\n\t\t Ignore (do not ignore) characters with parity errors.\n\n     imaxbel (-imaxbel)\n\t\t The system imposes a limit of MAX_INPUT (currently 255)\n\t\t characters in the input queue.  If imaxbel is set and the\n\t\t input queue limit has been reached, subsequent input causes\n\t\t the system to send an ASCII BEL character to the output queue\n\t\t (the terminal beeps at you).  Otherwise, if imaxbel is unset\n\t\t and the input queue is full, the next input character causes\n\t\t the entire input and output queues to be discarded.\n\n     inlcr (-inlcr)\n\t\t Map (do not map) NL to CR on input.\n\n     inpck (-inpck)\n\t\t Enable (disable) input parity checking.\n\n     istrip (-istrip)\n\t\t Strip (do not strip) input characters to seven bits.\n\n     iutf8 (-iutf8)\n\t\t Assume input characters are UTF-8 encoded.\n\n     ixany (-ixany)\n\t\t Allow any character (allow only START) to restart output.\n\n     ixoff (-ixoff)\n\t\t Request that the system send (not send) START/STOP characters\n\t\t when the input queue is nearly empty/full.\n\n     ixon (-ixon)\n\t\t Enable (disable) START/STOP output control.  Output from the\n\t\t system is stopped when the system receives STOP and started\n\t\t when the system receives START, or if ixany is set, any\n\t\t character restarts output.\n\n     parmrk (-parmrk)\n\t\t Mark (do not mark) characters with parity errors.\n\n   Output Modes:\n     This corresponds to the c_oflag of the termios structure.\n\n     bs0 bs1\t Select the style of delay for backspaces (e.g., set BSDLY to\n\t\t BS0).\n\n     cr0 cr1 cr2 cr3\n\t\t Select the style of delay for carriage returns (e.g., set\n\t\t CRDLY to CR0).\n\n     ff0 ff1\t Select the style of delay for form feeds (e.g., set FFDLY to\n\t\t FF0).\n\n     nl0 nl1\t Select the style of delay for newlines (e.g., set NLDLY to\n\t\t NL0).\n\n     ocrnl (-ocrnl)\n\t\t Map (do not map) carriage return to newline on output.\n\n     ofdel (-odell)\n\t\t Use DELs (NULs) as fill characters.\n\n     ofill (-ofill)\n\t\t Use fill characters (use timing) for delays.\n\n     onlcr (-onlcr)\n\t\t Map (do not map) NL to CR-NL on output.\n\n     onlret (-onlret)\n\t\t On the terminal, NL performs (does not perform) the CR\n\t\t function.\n\n     onocr (-onocr)\n\t\t Do not (do) output CRs at column zero.\n\n     opost (-opost)\n\t\t Post-process output (do not post-process output; ignore all\n\t\t other output modes).\n\n     oxtabs (-oxtabs)\n\t\t Expand (do not expand) tabs to spaces on output.\n\n     tab0 tab1 tab2 tab3\n\t\t Select the style of delay for horizontal tabs (e.g., set\n\t\t TABDLY to TAB0).\n\n     tabs (-tabs)\n\t\t Same as tab0 (tab3).\n\n     vt0 vt1\t Select the style of delay for vertical tabs (e.g., set VTDLY\n\t\t to VT0).\n\n   Local Modes:\n     Local mode flags (lflags) affect various and sundry characteristics of\n     terminal processing.  Historically the term \"local\" pertained to new job\n     control features implemented by Jim Kulp on a Pdp 11/70 at IIASA.\tLater,\n     the driver ran on the first VAX at Evans Hall, UC Berkeley, where the job\n     control details were greatly modified, but the structure definitions and\n     names remained essentially unchanged.  The second interpretation of the\n     'l' in lflag is ``line discipline flag'', which corresponds to the\n     c_lflag of the termios structure.\n\n     altwerase (-altwerase)\n\t\t Use (do not use) an alternate word erase algorithm when\n\t\t processing WERASE characters.\tThis alternate algorithm\n\t\t considers sequences of alphanumeric/underscores as words.

Otherwise,\n\t\t control characters echo as themselves.\n\n     echoe (-echoe)\n\t\t The ERASE character shall (shall not) visually erase the last\n\t\t character in the current line from the display, if possible.\n\n     echok (-echok)\n\t\t Echo (do not echo) NL after KILL character.\n\n     echoke (-echoke)\n\t\t The KILL character shall (shall not) visually erase the\n\t\t current line from the display, if possible.\n\n     echonl (-echonl)\n\t\t Echo (do not echo) NL, even if echo is disabled.\n\n     echoprt (-echoprt)\n\t\t For printing terminals.  If set, echo erased characters\n\t\t backwards within ``\\'' and ``/''.  Otherwise, disable this\n\t\t feature.\n\n     flusho (-flusho)\n\t\t Indicates output is (is not) being discarded.\n\n     icanon (-icanon)\n\t\t Enable (disable) canonical input (ERASE and KILL processing).\n\n     iexten (-iexten)\n\t\t Enable (disable) any implementation-defined special control\n\t\t characters that are not currently controlled by icanon, isig,\n\t\t ixoff, or ixon.\n\n     isig (-isig)\n\t\t Enable (disable) the checking of characters against the\n\t\t special control characters INTR, QUIT, and SUSP.\n\n     mdmbuf (-mdmbuf)\n\t\t If set, flow control output based on condition of Carrier\n\t\t Detect.  Otherwise, writes return an error if Carrier Detect\n\t\t is low (and Carrier is not being ignored with the CLOCAL\n\t\t flag.)\n\n     noflsh (-noflsh)\n\t\t Disable (enable) flush after INTR, QUIT, or SUSP.\n\n     pendin (-pendin)\n\t\t Indicates input is (is not) pending after a switch from non-\n\t\t canonical to canonical mode and will be re-input when a read\n\t\t becomes pending or more input arrives.\n\n     tostop (-tostop)\n\t\t Send (do not send) SIGTTOU for background output.  This\n\t\t causes background jobs to stop if they attempt terminal\n\t\t output.\n\n   Control Characters:\n     control-character string\n\t\t Set control-character to string.  If string is a single\n\t\t character, the control character is set to that character.\n\t\t If string is the two character sequence \"^-\" or the string\n\t\t \"undef\" the control character is disabled (i.e., set to\n\t\t {_POSIX_VDISABLE}.)\n\n\t\t Recognized control-characters:"
