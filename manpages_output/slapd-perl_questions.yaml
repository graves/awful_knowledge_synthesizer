Any perl database section of the configuration file\n       slapd.conf(5) must then specify what Perl module to use.  Slapd then\n       creates a new Perl object that handles all the requests for that\n       particular instance of the backend.\n\n       You will need to create a method for each one of the following actions:\n\n\t * new\t      # creates a new object,\n\t * search     # performs the ldap search,\n\t * compare    # does a compare,\n\t * modify     # modifies an entry,\n\t * add\t      # adds an entry to backend,\n\t * modrdn     # modifies an entry's rdn,\n\t * delete     # deletes an ldap entry,\n\t * config     # process unknown config file lines,\n\t * init       # called after backend is initialized.\n\n       Unless otherwise specified, the methods return the result code which\n       will be returned to the client.\tUnimplemented actions can just return\n       unwillingToPerform (53)."
