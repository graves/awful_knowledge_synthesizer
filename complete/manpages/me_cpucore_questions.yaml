The format of asm is specified in the\n\t      section MATCH PROGRAM REPRESENTATION.\n\n\t      Each element of the result contains instruction label,\n\t      instruction name, and the instruction arguments, in this order.\n\t      The label can be the empty string. Jump destinations are shown\n\t      as labels, strings and tokens unencoded. Token names are\n\t      prefixed with their numeric id, if, and only if a tokmap is\n\t      defined. The two components are separated by a colon.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core asm asm\n\t      This method returns code in the format as specified in section\n\t      MATCH PROGRAM REPRESENTATION generated from ME assembly code\n\t      asm, which is in the format as returned by the method disasm.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core new asm\n\t      This method creates state value for a ME virtual machine in its\n\t      initial state and returns it as its result.\n\n\t      The argument matchcode contains a Tcl representation of the\n\t      match instructions the machine has to execute while parsing the\n\t      input stream. Its format is specified in the section MATCH\n\t      PROGRAM REPRESENTATION.\n\n\t      The tokmap argument taken by the implementation provided by the\n\t      package grammar::me::tcl is here hidden inside of the match\n\t      instructions and therefore not needed.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core lc state location\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      uses it to convert a location in the input stream (as offset)\n\t      into a line number and column index. The result of the method is\n\t      a 2-element list containing the two pieces in the order\n\t      mentioned in the previous sentence.\n\n\t      Note that the method cannot convert locations which the machine\n\t      has not yet read from the input stream. In other words, if the\n\t      machine has read 7 characters so far it is possible to convert\n\t      the offsets 0 to 6, but nothing beyond that. This also shows\n\t      that it is not possible to convert offsets which refer to\n\t      locations before the beginning of the stream.\n\n\t      This utility allows higher levels to convert the location\n\t      offsets found in the error status and the AST into more human\n\t      readable data.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core tok state ?from ?to??\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns a Tcl list containing the part of the input stream\n\t      between the locations from and to (both inclusive). If to is not\n\t      specified it will default to the value of from. If from is not\n\t      specified either the whole input stream is returned.\n\n\t      This method places the same restrictions on its location\n\t      arguments as the method lc.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core pc state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the current value of the stored program counter.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core iseof state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the current value of the stored eof flag.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core at state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the current location in the input stream.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core cc state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the current token.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core sv state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the current semantic value stored in it.\tThis is an\n\t      abstract syntax tree as specified in the document\n\t      grammar::me_ast, section AST VALUES.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core ok state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the match status stored in it.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core error state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the current error status stored in it.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core lstk state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the location stack.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core astk state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the AST stack.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core mstk state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the AST marker stack.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core estk state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the error stack.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core rstk state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the subroutine return stack.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core nc state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the nonterminal match cache as a dictionary.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core ast state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the abstract syntax tree currently at the top of the AST\n\t      stack stored in it.  This is an abstract syntax tree as\n\t      specified in the document grammar::me_ast, section AST VALUES.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core halted state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the current halt status stored in it, i.e. if the\n\t      machine has stopped or not.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core code state\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine and\n\t      returns the code stored in it, i.e. the instructions executed by\n\t      the machine.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core eof statevar\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine as\n\t      stored in the variable named by statevar and modifies it so that\n\t      the eof flag inside is set. This signals to the machine that\n\t      whatever token are in the input queue are the last to be\n\t      processed. There will be no more.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core put statevar tok lex line col\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine as\n\t      stored in the variable named by statevar and modifies it so that\n\t      the token tok is added to the end of the input queue, with\n\t      associated lexeme data lex and line/column information.\n\n\t      The operation will fail with an error if the eof flag of the\n\t      machine has been set through the method eof.\n\n       ::grammar::me::cpu::core run statevar ?n?\n\t      This method takes the state value of a ME virtual machine as\n\t      stored in the variable named by statevar, executes a number of\n\t      instructions and stores the state resulting from their\n\t      modifications back into the variable.\n\n\t      The execution loop will run until either\n\n\t      •      n instructions have been executed, or\n\n\t      •      a halt instruction was executed, or\n\n\t      •      the input queue is empty and the code is asking for more\n\t\t     tokens to process.\n\n       If no limit n was set only the last two conditions are checked for.\n\n   MATCH PROGRAM REPRESENTATION\n       A match program is represented by nested Tcl list. The first element,\n       asm, is a list of integer numbers, the instructions to execute, and\n       their arguments. The second element, pool, is a list of strings,\n       referenced by the instructions, for error messages, token names, etc.\n       The third element, tokmap, provides ordering information for the\n       tokens, mapping their names to their numerical rank. This element can\n       be empty, forcing lexicographic comparison when matching ranges.\n\n       All ME instructions are encoded as integer numbers, with the mapping\n       given below. A number of the instructions, those which handle error\n       messages, have been given an additional argument to supply that message\n       explicitly instead of having it constructed from token names, etc. This\n       allows the machine state to store only the message ids instead of the\n       full strings.\n\n       Jump destination arguments are absolute indices into the asm element,\n       refering to the instruction to jump to. Any string arguments are\n       absolute indices into the pool element. Tokens, characters, messages,\n       and token (actually character) classes to match are coded as references\n       into the pool as well.\n\n       [1]    \"ict_advance message\"\n\n       [2]    \"ict_match_token tok message\"\n\n       [3]    \"ict_match_tokrange tokbegin tokend message\"\n\n       [4]    \"ict_match_tokclass code message\"\n\n       [5]    \"inc_restore branchlabel nt\"\n\n       [6]    \"inc_save nt\"\n\n       [7]    \"icf_ntcall branchlabel\"\n\n       [8]    \"icf_ntreturn\"\n\n       [9]    \"iok_ok\"\n\n       [10]   \"iok_fail\"\n\n       [11]   \"iok_negate\"\n\n       [12]   \"icf_jalways branchlabel\"\n\n       [13]   \"icf_jok branchlabel\"\n\n       [14]   \"icf_jfail branchlabel\"\n\n       [15]   \"icf_halt\"\n\n       [16]   \"icl_push\"\n\n       [17]   \"icl_rewind\"\n\n       [18]   \"icl_pop\"\n\n       [19]   \"ier_push\"\n\n       [20]   \"ier_clear\"\n\n       [21]   \"ier_nonterminal message\"\n\n       [22]   \"ier_merge\"\n\n       [23]   \"isv_clear\"\n\n       [24]   \"isv_terminal\"\n\n       [25]   \"isv_nonterminal_leaf nt\"\n\n       [26]   \"isv_nonterminal_range nt\"\n\n       [27]   \"isv_nonterminal_reduce nt\"\n\n       [28]   \"ias_push\"\n\n       [29]   \"ias_mark\"\n\n       [30]   \"ias_mrewind\"\n\n       [31]   \"ias_mpop\"\n\nCPU STATE\n       A state value is a list containing the following elements, in the order\n       listed below:\n\n       [1]    code: Match instructions, see MATCH PROGRAM REPRESENTATION.\n\n       [2]    pc:   Program counter, int.\n\n       [3]    halt: Halt flag, boolean.\n\n       [4]    eof:  Eof flag, boolean\n\n       [5]    tc:   Terminal cache, and input queue.
