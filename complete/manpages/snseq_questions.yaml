It is useful for\n       determining file access patterns of applications as well as measuring\n       I/O latency and performance at both VFS and device levels.\n\n       Running snseq first requires capturing client traces using the cvdb\n       command.  snseq emits to \"stdout\" so capturing output to a file\n       requires shell redirection.\n\n       By default, snseq displays a human-readable ASCII format. However, some\n       snseq command lines allow the specification of --csv that will cause it\n       to emit CSV format that can be used with spreadsheet applications.\n       This is especially useful for producing graphs. Visualizing data in\n       this manner can provide insight into how an application is performing\n       I/O."

  manpageQuestion3: What command would you use with snseq to examine the read operations in a trace file and display the results in human-readable ASCII format?

If for some reason the Python package available on\n       the system is incompatible with snseq, installing an additional Python\n       package may be required to run snseq. Alternatively, cvdb \"perf\" traces\n       captured on one system can often be processed on another system.  It is\n       often possible to capture cvdb perf traces on a client and then copy\n       them over to the MDC and run snseq there. This technique can also be\n       used to process perf traces taken from a backrev client, subject to\n       certain limitations. For example, older cvdb perf traces do not contain\n       enough information to display file names.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       cvdbset(8), cvdb(8)\n\nXsan File System\t\t November 2022\t\t\t      SNSEQ(8)"
