Each cell contains exactly one value of arbitrary form.\n       The cells in the matrix are addressed by pairs of integer numbers, with\n       the first (left) number in the pair specifying the column and the\n       second (right) number specifying the row the cell is in. These indices\n       are counted from 0 upward. The special non-numeric index end refers to\n       the last row or column in the matrix, depending on the context. Indices\n       of the form end-number are counted from the end of the row or column,\n       like they are for standard Tcl lists. Trying to access non-existing\n       cells causes an error.\n\n       The matrices here are created empty, i.e. they have neither rows nor\n       columns. The user then has to add rows and columns as needed by his\n       application. A specialty of this structure is the ability to export an\n       array-view onto its contents. Such can be used by tkTable, for example,\n       to link the matrix into the display.\n\n       The main command of the package is:\n\n       ::struct::matrix ?matrixName? ?=|:=|as|deserialize source?\n\t      The command creates a new matrix object with an associated\n\t      global Tcl command whose name is matrixName.  This command may\n\t      be used to invoke various operations on the matrix.  It has the\n\t      following general form:\n\n\t      matrixName option ?arg arg ...?\n\t\t     Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the\n\t\t     command.\n\n       If matrixName is not specified a unique name will be generated by the\n       package itself. If a source is specified the new matrix will be\n       initialized to it. For the operators =, :=, and as the argument source\n       is interpreted as the name of another matrix object, and the assignment\n       operator = will be executed. For deserialize the source is a serialized\n       matrix object and deserialize will be executed.\n\n       In other words\n\n\n\t   ::struct::matrix mymatrix = b\n\n\n       is equivalent to\n\n\n\t   ::struct::matrix mymatrix\n\t   mymatrix = b\n\n\n       and\n\n\n\t   ::struct::matrix mymatrix deserialize $b\n\n\n       is equivalent to\n\n\n\t   ::struct::matrix mymatrix\n\t   mymatrix deserialize $b\n\n\n       The following commands are possible for matrix objects:\n\n       matrixName = sourcematrix\n\t      This is the assignment operator for matrix objects. It copies\n\t      the matrix contained in the matrix object sourcematrix over the\n\t      matrix data in matrixName. The old contents of matrixName are\n\t      deleted by this operation.\n\n\t      This operation is in effect equivalent to\n\n\n\t\t  matrixName deserialize [sourcematrix serialize]\n\n\n       matrixName --> destmatrix\n\t      This is the reverse assignment operator for matrix objects. It\n\t      copies the matrix contained in the matrix object matrixName over\n\t      the matrix data in the object destmatrix.  The old contents of\n\t      destmatrix are deleted by this operation.\n\n\t      This operation is in effect equivalent to\n\n\n\t\t  destmatrix deserialize [matrixName serialize]\n\n\n       matrixName add column ?values?\n\t      Extends the matrix by one column and then acts like set column\n\t      (see below) on this new column if there were values supplied.\n\t      Without values the new cells will be set to the empty string.\n\t      The new column is appended immediately behind the last existing\n\t      column.\n\n       matrixName add row ?values?\n\t      Extends the matrix by one row and then acts like set row (see\n\t      below) on this new row if there were values supplied. Without\n\t      values the new cells will be set to the empty string. The new\n\t      row is appended immediately behind the last existing row.\n\n       matrixName add columns n\n\t      Extends the matrix by n columns. The new cells will be set to\n\t      the empty string. The new columns are appended immediately\n\t      behind the last existing column. A value of n equal to or\n\t      smaller than 0 is not allowed.\n\n       matrixName add rows n\n\t      Extends the matrix by n rows. The new cells will be set to the\n\t      empty string. The new rows are appended immediately behind the\n\t      last existing row. A value of n equal to or smaller than 0 is\n\t      not allowed.\n\n       matrixName cells\n\t      Returns the number of cells currently managed by the matrix.\n\t      This is the product of rows and columns.\n\n       matrixName cellsize column row\n\t      Returns the length of the string representation of the value\n\t      currently contained in the addressed cell.\n\n       matrixName columns\n\t      Returns the number of columns currently managed by the matrix.\n\n       matrixName columnwidth column\n\t      Returns the length of the longest string representation of all\n\t      the values currently contained in the cells of the addressed\n\t      column if these are all spanning only one line. For cell values\n\t      spanning multiple lines the length of their longest line goes\n\t      into the computation.\n\n       matrixName delete column column\n\t      Deletes the specified column from the matrix and shifts all\n\t      columns with higher indices one index down.\n\n       matrixName delete columns n\n\t      Deletes n columns from the right of the matrix. The value of n\n\t      has to satisfy the constraint \"0 < n < [matrixName columns]\"\n\n       matrixName delete row row\n\t      Deletes the specified row from the matrix and shifts all row\n\t      with higher indices one index down.\n\n       matrixName delete rows n\n\t      Deletes n rows from the bottom of the matrix. The value of n has\n\t      to satisfy the constraint \"0 < n < [matrixName rows]\"\n\n       matrixName deserialize serialization\n\t      This is the complement to serialize. It replaces matrix data in\n\t      matrixName with the matrix described by the serialization value.\n\t      The old contents of matrixName are deleted by this operation.\n\n       matrixName destroy\n\t      Destroys the matrix, including its storage space and associated\n\t      command.\n\n       matrixName format 2string ?report?\n\t      Formats the matrix using the specified report object and returns\n\t      the string containing the result of this operation. The report\n\t      has to support the printmatrix method. If no report is specified\n\t      the system will use an internal report definition to format the\n\t      matrix.\n\n       matrixName format 2chan ??report? channel?\n\t      Formats the matrix using the specified report object and writes\n\t      the string containing the result of this operation into the\n\t      channel. The report has to support the printmatrix2channel\n\t      method.  If no report is specified the system will use an\n\t      internal report definition to format the matrix. If no channel\n\t      is specified the system will use stdout.\n\n       matrixName get cell column row\n\t      Returns the value currently contained in the cell identified by\n\t      row and column index.\n\n       matrixName get column column\n\t      Returns a list containing the values from all cells in the\n\t      column identified by the index. The contents of the cell in row\n\t      0 are stored as the first element of this list.\n\n       matrixName get rect column_tl row_tl column_br row_br\n\t      Returns a list of lists of cell values. The values stored in the\n\t      result come from the sub-matrix whose top-left and bottom-right\n\t      cells are specified by column_tl, row_tl and column_br, row_br\n\t      resp. Note that the following equations have to be true:\n\t      \"column_tl <= column_br\" and \"row_tl <= row_br\". The result is\n\t      organized as follows: The outer list is the list of rows, its\n\t      elements are lists representing a single row. The row with the\n\t      smallest index is the first element of the outer list. The\n\t      elements of the row lists represent the selected cell values.\n\t      The cell with the smallest index is the first element in each\n\t      row list.\n\n       matrixName get row row\n\t      Returns a list containing the values from all cells in the row\n\t      identified by the index. The contents of the cell in column 0\n\t      are stored as the first element of this list.\n\n       matrixName insert column column ?values?\n\t      Extends the matrix by one column and then acts like set column\n\t      (see below) on this new column if there were values supplied.\n\t      Without values the new cells will be set to the empty string.\n\t      The new column is inserted just before the column specified by\n\t      the given index. This means, if column is less than or equal to\n\t      zero, then the new column is inserted at the beginning of the\n\t      matrix, before the first column. If column has the value end, or\n\t      if it is greater than or equal to the number of columns in the\n\t      matrix, then the new column is appended to the matrix, behind\n\t      the last column. The old column at the chosen index and all\n\t      columns with higher indices are shifted one index upward.\n\n       matrixName insert row row ?values?\n\t      Extends the matrix by one row and then acts like set row (see\n\t      below) on this new row if there were values supplied. Without\n\t      values the new cells will be set to the empty string. The new\n\t      row is inserted just before the row specified by the given\n\t      index. This means, if row is less than or equal to zero, then\n\t      the new row is inserted at the beginning of the matrix, before\n\t      the first row. If row has the value end, or if it is greater\n\t      than or equal to the number of rows in the matrix, then the new\n\t      row is appended to the matrix, behind the last row. The old row\n\t      at that index and all rows with higher indices are shifted one\n\t      index upward.\n\n       matrixName link ?-transpose? arrayvar\n\t      Links the matrix to the specified array variable. This means\n\t      that the contents of all cells in the matrix is stored in the\n\t      array too, with all changes to the matrix propagated there too.\n\t      The contents of the cell (column,row) is stored in the array\n\t      using the key column,row. If the option -transpose is specified\n\t      the key row,column will be used instead. It is possible to link\n\t      the matrix to more than one array. Note that the link is\n\t      bidirectional, i.e. changes to the array are mirrored in the\n\t      matrix too.\n\n       matrixName links\n\t      Returns a list containing the names of all array variables the\n\t      matrix was linked to through a call to method link.\n\n       matrixName rowheight row\n\t      Returns the height of the specified row in lines. This is the\n\t      highest number of lines spanned by a cell over all cells in the\n\t      row.\n\n       matrixName rows\n\t      Returns the number of rows currently managed by the matrix.\n\n       matrixName search ?-nocase? ?-exact|-glob|-regexp? all pattern\n\t      Searches the whole matrix for cells matching the pattern and\n\t      returns a list with all matches. Each item in the aforementioned\n\t      list is a list itself and contains the column and row index of\n\t      the matching cell, in this order. The results are ordered by\n\t      column first and row second, both times in ascending order. This\n\t      means that matches to the left and the top of the matrix come\n\t      before matches to the right and down.\n\n\t      The type of the pattern (string, glob, regular expression) is\n\t      determined by the option after the search keyword. If no option\n\t      is given it defaults to -exact.\n\n\t      If the option -nocase is specified the search will be case-\n\t      insensitive.\n\n       matrixName search ?-nocase? ?-exact|-glob|-regexp? column column\n       pattern\n\t      Like search all, but the search is restricted to the specified\n\t      column.\n\n       matrixName search ?-nocase? ?-exact|-glob|-regexp? row row pattern\n\t      Like search all, but the search is restricted to the specified\n\t      row.\n\n       matrixName search ?-nocase? ?-exact|-glob|-regexp? rect column_tl\n       row_tl column_br row_br pattern\n\t      Like search all, but the search is restricted to the specified\n\t      rectangular area of the matrix.\n\n       matrixName serialize ?column_tl row_tl column_br row_br?\n\t      This method serializes the sub-matrix spanned up by the\n\t      rectangle specification. In other words it returns a tcl value\n\t      completely describing that matrix. If no rectangle is specified\n\t      the whole matrix will be serialized.  This allows, for example,\n\t      the transfer of matrix objects (or parts thereof) over arbitrary\n\t      channels, persistence, etc.  This method is also the basis for\n\t      both the copy constructor and the assignment operator.\n\n\t      The result of this method has to be semantically identical over\n\t      all implementations of the matrix interface. This is what will\n\t      enable us to copy matrix data between different implementations\n\t      of the same interface.\n\n\t      The result is a list containing exactly three items.\n\n\t      The first two elements of the list specify the number of rows\n\t      and columns of the matrix, in that order. The values integer\n\t      numbers greater than or equal to zero.\n\n\t      The last element of the list contains the values of the matrix\n\t      cells we have serialized, in the form of a value like it is\n\t      returned by the get rect. However empty cells to the right and\n\t      bottom of the matrix can be left out of that value as the size\n\t      information in the serialization allows the receiver the\n\t      creation of a matrix with the proper size despite the missing\n\t      values.\n\n\t\t  # A possible serialization for the matrix structure\n\t\t  #\n\t\t  # | a b d g |\n\t\t  # | c e     |\n\t\t  # | f       |\n\t\t  #\n\t\t  # is\n\t\t  #\n\t\t  # 3 4 {{a b d g} {c e} {f}}"
