If it is invoked by launchd(8), bootpd\n     continues to service requests until it is idle for a period of 5 minutes,\n     after which it exits to conserve system resources.  If invoked manually,\n     bootpd continues to run indefinitely.\n\n     If bootpd receives a SIGHUP (-1) signal, it will re-read its\n     configuration and client binding files.\n\n     When a request from a client arrives, the server logs an entry to\n     /var/log/system.log indicating which client made the request, and logs\n     another entry once a reply is sent.  This feature can be turned off using\n     the -q option described below."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `bootpd`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nSee bootptab(5) for more information about the /etc/bootptab file.\n\n     For Open Directory, bootpd looks at the /Computers records for the\n     following properties:\n\n     ENetAddress\t      (String) The ethernet MAC address(es) of the\n\t\t\t      computer.  Each address must be of the form\n\t\t\t      xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx using only the characters\n\t\t\t      0123456789abcdef.  Leading zeros must be\n\t\t\t      specified.\n\n     IPAddress\t\t      (String) The IP address(es) of the computer.\n\n     IPAddressAndENetAddress  (String) Pairs of IP and Ethernet MAC addresses\n\t\t\t      of the computer.\tEach address pair consists of\n\t\t\t      an single IP and MAC address separated by a\n\t\t\t      slash character, e.g.\n\t\t\t      \"192.168.1.1/01:23:45:67:89:ab\".\tThis attribute\n\t\t\t      should be provided when multiple addresses are\n\t\t\t      provided because not all directories return\n\t\t\t      attribute values in a guaranteed order.\n\n     BootFile\t\t      (String) The bootfile to use for this computer.\n\nDHCP SERVICE\n     If DHCP service is enabled for a client, the server processes the\n     client's packet.  The packet may be a request for an IP address and\n     option information (DHCP Discover, DHCP Request) or for just option\n     information (DHCP Inform).  The packet might also tell the server that\n     the address is in use by some other host (DHCP Decline), or that the\n     client is done with the IP address (DHCP Release)."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `bootpd`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe server uses the DHCP client identifier (option 61) if it is present\n     as the unique client identifier, otherwise it uses the htype/hlen/chaddr\n     fields in the DHCP packet.\n\n   IP Allocation\n     The DHCP server first tries to find a static binding for the client (see\n     section BOOTP/DHCP STATIC BINDINGS above).  If one exists, it uses it.\n     If not, it tries to find an existing dynamic binding from its lease\n     database, stored in /var/db/dhcpd_leases.\tIf one exists and it is\n     applicable to the subnet, the server uses it, otherwise, it tries to\n     allocate an address from one of its address pools.  If an address is\n     available, the server uses it, otherwise the packet is discarded.\n\n     After a suitable IP address is found for the client, the server attempts\n     to insert as many of the requested DHCP options from the client's request\n     as it can into the reply.\n\n     When the server allocates an address dynamically, it automatically\n     excludes addresses that appear in static host entries.  For example, if\n     the address range goes from 10.0.0.2 through 10.0.0.10, but there is a\n     static entry that specifies 10.0.0.3, that address is automatically\n     excluded from the pool."
