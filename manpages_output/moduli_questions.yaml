A second primality\n     testing pass, using ssh-keygen -M screen, provides a high degree of\n     assurance that the numbers are prime and are safe for use in Diffie-\n     Hellman operations by sshd(8).  This moduli format is used as the output\n     from each pass.\n\n     The file consists of newline-separated records, one per modulus,\n     containing seven space-separated fields.  These fields are as follows:\n\n\t   timestamp\tThe time that the modulus was last processed as\n\t\t\tYYYYMMDDHHMMSS.\n\n\t   type \tDecimal number specifying the internal structure of\n\t\t\tthe prime modulus.  Supported types are:"
