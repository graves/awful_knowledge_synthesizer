Currently logged in users are tracked in /var/run/utmpx.  The\n     interface to the utmpx file is described in endutxent(3).\tThe file is\n     not automatically created if they do not exist; it must be created\n     manually.\n\n     Traditionally, separate files would be used to store the running log of\n     the logins and logouts (wtmpx), and the last login of each user\n     (lastlogx).  With the availability of the Apple system log facility\n     asl(3), these separate files can be replace with log entries, which are\n     automatically generated when utmpx entries are written.  The API to\n     access the logins and logouts is described in endutxent_wtmp(3) while the\n     last login info is accessible with getlastlogx(3)."
