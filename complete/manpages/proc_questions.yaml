Normally, name is unqualified (does\n       not include the names of any containing namespaces), and the new\n       procedure is created in the current namespace.  If name includes any\n       namespace qualifiers, the procedure is created in the specified\n       namespace.  Args specifies the formal arguments to the procedure.  It\n       consists of a list, possibly empty, each of whose elements specifies\n       one argument.  Each argument specifier is also a list with either one\n       or two fields.  If there is only a single field in the specifier then\n       it is the name of the argument; if there are two fields, then the first\n       is the argument name and the second is its default value.  Arguments\n       with default values that are followed by non-defaulted arguments become\n       required arguments.  In 8.6 this will be considered an error.\n\n       When name is invoked a local variable will be created for each of the\n       formal arguments to the procedure; its value will be the value of\n       corresponding argument in the invoking command or the argument's\n       default value.  Actual arguments are assigned to formal arguments\n       strictly in order.  Arguments with default values need not be specified\n       in a procedure invocation.  However, there must be enough actual\n       arguments for all the formal arguments that do not have defaults, and\n       there must not be any extra actual arguments.  Arguments with default\n       values that are followed by non-defaulted arguments become required\n       arguments (in 8.6 it will be considered an error).  There is one\n       special case to permit procedures with variable numbers of arguments.\n       If the last formal argument has the name args, then a call to the\n       procedure may contain more actual arguments than the procedure has\n       formals.  In this case, all of the actual arguments starting at the one\n       that would be assigned to args are combined into a list (as if the list\n       command had been used); this combined value is assigned to the local\n       variable args.\n\n       When body is being executed, variable names normally refer to local\n       variables, which are created automatically when referenced and deleted\n       when the procedure returns.  One local variable is automatically\n       created for each of the procedure's arguments.  Other variables can\n       only be accessed by invoking one of the global, variable, upvar or\n       namespace upvar commands.\n\n       The proc command returns an empty string.  When a procedure is invoked,\n       the procedure's return value is the value specified in a return\n       command.  If the procedure does not execute an explicit return, then\n       its return value is the value of the last command executed in the\n       procedure's body.  If an error occurs while executing the procedure\n       body, then the procedure-as-a-whole will return that same error.\n\nEXAMPLES\n       This is a procedure that accepts arbitrarily many arguments and prints\n       them out, one by one.\n\t      proc printArguments args {\n\t\t foreach arg $args {\n\t\t    puts $arg\n\t\t }\n\t      }\n\n       This procedure is a bit like the incr command, except it multiplies the\n       contents of the named variable by the value, which defaults to 2:\n\t      proc mult {varName {multiplier 2}} {\n\t\t upvar 1 $varName var\n\t\t set var [expr {$var * $multiplier}]\n\t      }"
