If x is \"-\", no escape char is used and arguments\n\t      containing metachars are surrounded by quotes instead.\n\n       -ox    Specifies \"x\", rather than double-quote, to be the open quote\n\t      character, which is used if the -e- option is specified.\n\n       -cx    Specifies \"x\" to be the close quote character.\n\n       -pn    Specifies \"n\" to be the open quote character, as an integer.\n\n       -dn    Specifies \"n\" to be the close quote character, as an integer."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the lessecho tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use lessecho to display the contents of a file while escaping metacharacters with a backslash?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using lessecho to display a file's contents with "x" as the escape character and "" as the open quote character?
