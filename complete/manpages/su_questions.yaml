A shell is then\n     executed.\n\n     PAM is used to set the policy su(1) will use.  In particular, by default\n     only users in the “admin” or “wheel” groups can switch to UID 0 (“root”).\n     This group requirement may be changed by modifying the “pam_group”\n     section of /etc/pam.d/su.\tSee pam_group(8) for details on how to modify\n     this setting.\n\n     By default, the environment is unmodified with the exception of USER,\n     HOME, and SHELL.  HOME and SHELL are set to the target login's default\n     values.  USER is set to the target login, unless the target login has a\n     user ID of 0, in which case it is unmodified.  The invoked shell is the\n     one belonging to the target login.  This is the traditional behavior of\n     su."
