Quick uses a quadratic\n\t interpolation post correlation, resampler performs resampling of the\n\t signal before correlation and post-resampler performs resampling of\n\t the correlated signal. Quadratic interpollation results can have some\n\t error present but runs much faster than resampling. Quadratic\n\t interpollation can be used to do a quick analysis before spending\n\t time doing the full analysis. Post resampling, where the correlation\n\t signal is upsampled is much quicker than resampling prior to\n\t correlation but can produce slightly different results when the drift\n\t is right on the edge of a quantization level. post-resampler is the\n\t default mode if nothing is specified.\n\n     [--audio-limit seconds]\n\t Limit the audio analysis to the first N seconds of audio in the file.\n\n     [--window-lower lower-limit]\n\t Specify the smallest window size to perform the analysis on.
