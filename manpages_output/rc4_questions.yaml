[ -in\n       channel | -infile filename | string ]\n\n       ::rc4::RC4Init keydata\n\n       ::rc4::RC4 Key data\n\n       ::rc4::RC4Final Key\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This package is an implementation in Tcl of the RC4 stream cipher\n       developed by Ron Rivest of RSA Data Security Inc. The cipher was a\n       trade secret of RSA but was reverse-engineered and published to the\n       internet in 1994. It is used in a number of network protocols for\n       securing communications. To evade trademark restrictions this cipher is\n       sometimes known as ARCFOUR.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::rc4::rc4 ?-hex? -key keyvalue ?-command lst? ?-out channel? [ -in\n       channel | -infile filename | string ]\n\t      Perform the RC4 algorithm on either the data provided by the\n\t      argument or on the data read from the -in channel. If an -out\n\t      channel is given then the result will be written to this\n\t      channel.\tGiving the -hex option will return a hexadecimal\n\t      encoded version of the result if not using an -out channel.\n\n\t      The data to be processes can be specified either as a string\n\t      argument to the rc4 command, or as a filename or a pre-opened\n\t      channel. If the -infile argument is given then the file is\n\t      opened, the data read and processed and the file is closed. If\n\t      the -in argument is given then data is read from the channel\n\t      until the end of file. The channel is not closed. If the -out\n\t      argument is given then the processing result is written to this\n\t      channel.\n\n\t      If -command is provided then the rc4 command does not return\n\t      anything. Instead the command provided is called with the rc4\n\t      result data appended as the final parameter. This is most useful\n\t      when reading from Tcl channels as a fileevent is setup on the\n\t      channel and the data processed in chunks\n\n\t      Only one of -infile, -in or string should be given.\n\nPROGRAMMING INTERFACE\n       ::rc4::RC4Init keydata\n\t      Initialize a new RC4 key. The keydata is any amount of binary\n\t      data and is used to initialize the cipher internal state.\n\n       ::rc4::RC4 Key data\n\t      Encrypt or decrypt the input data using the key obtained by\n\t      calling RC4Init.\n\n       ::rc4::RC4Final Key\n\t      This should be called to clean up resources associated with Key.\n\t      Once this function has been called the key is destroyed.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n       % set keydata [binary format H* 0123456789abcdef]\n       % rc4::rc4 -hex -key $keydata HelloWorld\n       3cf1ae8b7f1c670b612f\n       % rc4::rc4 -hex -key $keydata [binary format H* 3cf1ae8b7f1c670b612f]\n       HelloWorld"
