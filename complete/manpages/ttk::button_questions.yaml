If less than zero,\n       specifies a minimum width.  If zero or unspecified, the natural width\n       of the text label is used.  Note that some themes may specify a non-\n       zero -width in the style.\n\nWIDGET COMMAND\n       In addition to the standard cget, configure, identify, instate, and\n       state commands, buttons support the following additional widget\n       commands:\n\n       pathName invoke\n\t      Invokes the command associated with the button.\n\nSTANDARD STYLES\n       Ttk::button widgets support the Toolbutton style in all standard\n       themes, which is useful for creating widgets for toolbars.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY OPTIONS\n       [-state state] May be set to normal or disabled to control the disabled\n       state bit. This is a “write-only” option: setting it changes the widget\n       state, but the state widget command does not affect the state option."
