Both old and new must be of the same\n     type (that is, both must be either directories or non-directories) and\n     must reside on the same file system.\n\n     The rename() system call guarantees that an instance of new will always\n     exist, even if the system should crash in the middle of the operation.\n\n     If the final component of old is a symbolic link, the symbolic link is\n     renamed, not the file or directory to which it points."

If from is a relative\n     path, the file to be renamed is located relative to the directory\n     associated with the file descriptor fromfd instead of the current working\n     directory.  If the to is a relative path, the same happens only relative\n     to the directory associated with tofd.  If the renameat() is passed the\n     special value AT_FDCWD in the fromfd or tofd parameter, the current\n     working directory is used in the determination of the file for the\n     respective path parameter.\n\n     The renamex_np() and renameatx_np() system calls are similar to their\n     counterparts except that they take a flags argument.  Values for flags\n     are constructed with below bits set:\n\n\t   RENAME_SWAP\n\t\t   On file systems that support it (see getattrlist(2)\n\t\t   VOL_CAP_INT_RENAME_SWAP), it will cause the source and\n\t\t   target to be atomically swapped.  Source and target need\n\t\t   not be of the same type, i.e. it is possible to swap a file\n\t\t   with a directory.  EINVAL is returned in case of bitwise-\n\t\t   inclusive OR with RENAME_EXCL."
