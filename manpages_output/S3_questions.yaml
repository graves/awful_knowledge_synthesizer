See http://www.amazonaws.com/ for details on\n       that system.  Access to the service is via HTTP (SOAP or REST).\tMuch\n       of this documentation will not make sense if you're not familiar with\n       the terms and functionality of the Amazon S3 service.\n\n       This package provides services for reading and writing the data items\n       via the REST interface.\tIt also provides some higher-level operations.\n       Other packages in the same distribution provide for even more\n       functionality.\n\n       Copyright 2006 Darren New.

See\n       LICENSE.txt for the terms.\n\nERROR REPORTING\n       The error reporting from this package makes use of $errorCode to\n       provide more details on what happened than simply throwing an error.\n       Any error caught by the S3 package (and we try to catch them all) will\n       return with an $errorCode being a list having at least three elements.\n       In all cases, the first element will be \"S3\". The second element will\n       take on one of six values, with that element defining the value of the\n       third and subsequent elements. S3::REST does not throw an error, but\n       rather returns a dictionary with the keys \"error\", \"errorInfo\", and\n       \"errorCode\" set. This allows for reliable background use. The possible\n       second elements are these:\n\n       usage  The usage of the package is incorrect. For example, a command\n\t      has been invoked which requires the library to be configured\n\t      before the library has been configured, or an invalid\n\t      combination of options has been specified. The third element of\n\t      $errorCode supplies the name of the parameter that was wrong.\n\t      The fourth usually provides the arguments that were actually\n\t      supplied to the throwing proc, unless the usage error isn't\n\t      confined to a single proc.\n\n       local  Something happened on the local system which threw an error. For\n\t      example, a request to upload or download a file was made and the\n\t      file permissions denied that sort of access. The third element\n\t      of $errorCode is the original $errorCode.\n\n       socket Something happened with the socket. It closed prematurely, or\n\t      some other condition of failure-to-communicate-with-Amazon was\n\t      detected. The third element of $errorCode is the original\n\t      $errorCode, or sometimes the message from fcopy, or ...?\n\n       remote The Amazon web service returned an error code outside the 2xx\n\t      range in the HTTP header. In other words, everything went as\n\t      documented, except this particular case was documented not to\n\t      work.  The third element is the dictionary returned from\n\t      ::S3::REST.  Note that S3::REST itself never throws this error,\n\t      but just returns the dictionary. Most of the higher-level\n\t      commands throw for convenience, unless an argument indicates\n\t      they should not. If something is documented as \"not throwing an\n\t      S3 remote error\", it means a status return is set rather than\n\t      throwing an error if Amazon returns a non-2XX HTTP result code.\n\n       notyet The user obeyed the documentation, but the author has not yet\n\t      gotten around to implementing this feature. (Right now, only TLS\n\t      support and sophisticated permissions fall into this category,\n\t      as well as the S3::Acl command.)\n\n       xml    The service has returned invalid XML, or XML whose schema is\n\t      unexpected. For the high-level commands that accept service XML\n\t      as input for parsing, this may also be thrown.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       This package provides several separate levels of complexity.\n\n       •      The lowest level simply takes arguments to be sent to the\n\t      service, sends them, retrieves the result, and provides it to\n\t      the caller.  Note: This layer allows both synchronous and event-\n\t      driven processing. It depends on the MD5 and SHA1 and base64\n\t      packages from Tcllib (available at\n\t      http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/).\tNote that S3::Configure is\n\t      required for S3::REST to work due to the authentication portion,\n\t      so we put that in the \"lowest level.\"\n\n       •      The next layer parses the results of calls, allowing for\n\t      functionality such as uploading only changed files,\n\t      synchronizing directories, and so on.  This layer depends on the\n\t      TclXML package as well as the included xsxp package. These\n\t      packages are package required when these more-sophisticated\n\t      routines are called, so nothing breaks if they are not correctly\n\t      installed.\n\n       •      Also included is a separate program that uses the library.  It\n\t      provides code to parse $argv0 and $argv from the command line,\n\t      allowing invocation as a tclkit, etc.  (Not yet implmented.)\n\n       •      Another separate program provides a GUI interface allowing drag-\n\t      and-drop and other such functionality. (Not yet implemented.)\n\n       •      Also built on this package is the OddJob program. It is a\n\t      separate program designed to allow distribution of computational\n\t      work units over Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud web service.\n\n       The goal is to have at least the bottom-most layers implemented in pure\n       Tcl using only that which comes from widely-available sources, such as\n       Tcllib.\n\nLOW LEVEL COMMANDS\n       These commands do not require any packages not listed above.  They talk\n       directly to the service, or they are utility or configuration routines.\n       Note that the \"xsxp\" package was written to support this package, so it\n       should be available wherever you got this package.\n\n       S3::Configure ?-reset boolean? ?-retries integer? ?-accesskeyid\n       idstring? ?-secretaccesskey idstring? ?-service-access-point FQDN?\n       ?-use-tls boolean? ?-default-compare\n       always|never|exists|missing|newer|date|checksum|different? ?-default-\n       separator string? ?-default-acl private|public-read|public-read-\n       write|authenticated-read|keep|calc? ?-default-bucket bucketname?\n\t      There is one command for configuration, and that is\n\t      S3::Configure.  If called with no arguments, it returns a\n\t      dictionary of key/value pairs listing all current settings.  If\n\t      called with one argument, it returns the value of that single\n\t      argument.  If called with two or more arguments, it must be\n\t      called with pairs of arguments, and it applies the changes in\n\t      order.  There is only one set of configuration information per\n\t      interpreter.\n\n\t      The following options are accepted:\n\n\t      -reset boolean\n\t\t     By default, false.  If true, any previous changes and any\n\t\t     changes on the same call before the reset option will be\n\t\t     returned to default values.\n\n\t      -retries integer\n\t\t     Default value is 3.  If Amazon returns a 500 error, a\n\t\t     retry after an exponential backoff delay will be tried\n\t\t     this many times before finally throwing the 500 error.\n\t\t     This applies to each call to S3::REST from the higher-\n\t\t     level commands, but not to S3::REST itself.  That is,\n\t\t     S3::REST will always return httpstatus 500 if that's what\n\t\t     it receives. Functions like S3::Put will retry the PUT\n\t\t     call, and will also retry the GET and HEAD calls used to\n\t\t     do content comparison.  Changing this to 0 will prevent\n\t\t     retries and their associated delays.  In addition, socket\n\t\t     errors (i.e., errors whose errorCode starts with \"S3\n\t\t     socket\") will be similarly retried after backoffs.\n\n\t      -accesskeyid idstring\n\n\t      -secretaccesskey idstring\n\t\t     Each defaults to an empty string.\tThese must be set\n\t\t     before any calls are made. This is your S3 ID.  Once you\n\t\t     sign up for an account, go to http://www.amazonaws.com/,\n\t\t     sign in, go to the \"Your Web Services Account\" button,\n\t\t     pick \"AWS Access Identifiers\", and your access key ID and\n\t\t     secret access keys will be available. All S3::REST calls\n\t\t     are authenticated.  Blame Amazon for the poor choice of\n\t\t     names.\n\n\t      -service-access-point FQDN\n\t\t     Defaults to \"s3.amazonaws.com\". This is the fully-\n\t\t     qualified domain name of the server to contact for\n\t\t     S3::REST calls. You should probably never need to touch\n\t\t     this, unless someone else implements a compatible\n\t\t     service, or you wish to test something by pointing the\n\t\t     library at your own service.\n\n\t      -slop-seconds integer\n\t\t     When comparing dates between Amazon and the local\n\t\t     machine, two dates within this many seconds of each other\n\t\t     are considered the same. Useful for clock drift\n\t\t     correction, processing overhead time, and so on.\n\n\t      -use-tls boolean\n\t\t     Defaults to false. This is not yet implemented. If true,\n\t\t     S3::REST will negotiate a TLS connection to Amazon. If\n\t\t     false, unencrypted connections are used.\n\n\t      -bucket-prefix string\n\t\t     Defaults to \"TclS3\".  This string is used by\n\t\t     S3::SuggestBucketName if that command is passed an empty\n\t\t     string as an argument. It is used to distinguish\n\t\t     different applications using the Amazon service.  Your\n\t\t     application should always set this to keep from\n\t\t     interfering with the buckets of other users of Amazon S3\n\t\t     or with other buckets of the same user.\n\n\t      -default-compare\n\t      always|never|exists|missing|newer|date|checksum|different\n\t\t     Defaults to \"always.\" If no -compare is specified on\n\t\t     S3::Put, S3::Get, or S3::Delete, this comparison is used.\n\t\t     See those commands for a description of the meaning.\n\n\t      -default-separator string\n\t\t     Defaults to \"/\". This is currently unused. It might make\n\t\t     sense to use this for S3::Push and S3::Pull, but allowing\n\t\t     resources to have slashes in their names that aren't\n\t\t     marking directories would be problematic. Hence, this\n\t\t     currently does nothing.\n\n\t      -default-acl private|public-read|public-read-\n\t      write|authenticated-read|keep|calc\n\t\t     Defaults to an empty string. If no -acl argument is\n\t\t     provided to S3::Put or S3::Push, this string is used\n\t\t     (given as the x-amz-acl header if not keep or calc). If\n\t\t     this is also empty, no x-amz-acl header is generated.\n\t\t     This is not used by S3::REST.\n\n\t      -default-bucket bucketname\n\t\t     If no bucket is given to S3::GetBucket, S3::PutBucket,\n\t\t     S3::Get, S3::Put, S3::Head, S3::Acl, S3::Delete,\n\t\t     S3::Push, S3::Pull, or S3::Toss, and if this\n\t\t     configuration variable is not an empty string (and not\n\t\t     simply \"/\"), then this value will be used for the bucket.\n\t\t     This is useful if one program does a large amount of\n\t\t     resource manipulation within a single bucket."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `S3`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nS3::SuggestBucket ?name?\n\t      The S3::SuggestBucket command accepts an optional string as a\n\t      prefix and returns a valid bucket containing the name argument\n\t      and the Access Key ID. This makes the name unique to the owner\n\t      and to the application (assuming the application picks a good\n\t      name argument).  If no name is provided, the name from\n\t      S3::Configure -bucket-prefix is used.  If that too is empty\n\t      (which is not the default), an error is thrown.\n\n       S3::REST dict\n\t      The S3::REST command takes as an argument a dictionary and\n\t      returns a dictionary.  The return dictionary has the same keys\n\t      as the input dictionary, and includes additional keys as the\n\t      result.  The presence or absence of keys in the input dictionary\n\t      can control the behavior of the routine.\tIt never throws an\n\t      error directly, but includes keys \"error\", \"errorInfo\", and\n\t      \"errorCode\" if necessary.  Some keys are required, some\n\t      optional. The routine can run either in blocking or non-blocking\n\t      mode, based on the presense of resultvar in the input\n\t      dictionary. This requires the -accesskeyid and -secretaccesskey\n\t      to be configured via S3::Configure before being called.\n\n\t      The possible input keys are these:\n\n\t      verb GET|PUT|DELETE|HEAD\n\t\t     This required item indicates the verb to be used.\n\n\t      resource string\n\t\t     This required item indicates the resource to be accessed.\n\t\t     A leading / is added if not there already. It will be\n\t\t     URL-encoded for you if necessary. Do not supply a\n\t\t     resource name that is already URL-encoded.\n\n\t      ?rtype torrent|acl?\n\t\t     This indicates a torrent or acl resource is being\n\t\t     manipulated.  Do not include this in the resource key, or\n\t\t     the \"?\" separator will get URL-encoded.\n\n\t      ?parameters dict?\n\t\t     This optional dictionary provides parameters added to the\n\t\t     URL for the transaction. The keys must be in the correct\n\t\t     case (which is confusing in the Amazon documentation) and\n\t\t     the values must be valid. This can be an empty dictionary\n\t\t     or omitted entirely if no parameters are desired. No\n\t\t     other error checking on parameters is performed.\n\n\t      ?headers dict?\n\t\t     This optional dictionary provides headers to be added to\n\t\t     the HTTP request. The keys must be in lower case for the\n\t\t     authentication to work. The values must not contain\n\t\t     embedded newlines or carriage returns. This is primarily\n\t\t     useful for adding x-amz-* headers. Since authentication\n\t\t     is calculated by S3::REST, do not add that header here.\n\t\t     Since content-type gets its own key, also do not add that\n\t\t     header here.\n\n\t      ?inbody contentstring?\n\t\t     This optional item, if provided, gives the content that\n\t\t     will be sent. It is sent with a tranfer encoding of\n\t\t     binary, and only the low bytes are used, so use [encoding\n\t\t     convertto utf-8] if the string is a utf-8 string. This is\n\t\t     written all in one blast, so if you are using non-\n\t\t     blocking mode and the inbody is especially large, you may\n\t\t     wind up blocking on the write socket.\n\n\t      ?infile filename?\n\t\t     This optional item, if provided, and if inbody is not\n\t\t     provided, names the file from which the body of the HTTP\n\t\t     message will be constructed. The file is opened for\n\t\t     reading and sent progressively by [fcopy], so it should\n\t\t     not block in non-blocking mode even if the file is very\n\t\t     large. The file is transfered in binary mode, so the\n\t\t     bytes on your disk will match the bytes in your resource.\n\t\t     Due to HTTP restrictions, it must be possible to use\n\t\t     [file size] on this file to determine the size at the\n\t\t     start of the transaction.\n\n\t      ?S3chan channel?\n\t\t     This optional item, if provided, indicates the already-\n\t\t     open socket over which the transaction should be\n\t\t     conducted. If not provided, a connection is made to the\n\t\t     service access point specified via S3::Configure, which\n\t\t     is normally s3.amazonaws.com. If this is provided, the\n\t\t     channel is not closed at the end of the transaction.\n\n\t      ?outchan channel?\n\t\t     This optional item, if provided, indicates the already-\n\t\t     open channel to which the body returned from S3 should be\n\t\t     written. That is, to retrieve a large resource, open a\n\t\t     file, set the translation mode, and pass the channel as\n\t\t     the value of the key outchan. Output will be written to\n\t\t     the channel in pieces so memory does not fill up\n\t\t     unnecessarily. The channel is not closed at the end of\n\t\t     the transaction.\n\n\t      ?resultvar varname?\n\t\t     This optional item, if provided, indicates that S3::REST\n\t\t     should run in non-blocking mode. The varname should be\n\t\t     fully qualified with respect to namespaces and cannot be\n\t\t     local to a proc. If provided, the result of the S3::REST\n\t\t     call is assigned to this variable once everything has\n\t\t     completed; use trace or vwait to know when this has\n\t\t     happened.\tIf this key is not provided, the result is\n\t\t     simply returned from the call to S3::REST and no calls to\n\t\t     the eventloop are invoked from within this call.\n\n\t      ?throwsocket throw|return?\n\t\t     This optional item, if provided, indicates that S3::REST\n\t\t     should throw an error if throwmode is throw and a socket\n\t\t     error is encountered.  It indicates that S3::REST should\n\t\t     return the error code in the returned dictionary if a\n\t\t     socket error is encountered and this is set to return. If\n\t\t     throwsocket is set to return or if the call is not\n\t\t     blocking, then a socket error (i.e., an error whose error\n\t\t     code starts with \"S3 socket\" will be returned in the\n\t\t     dictionary as error, errorInfo, and errorCode.  If a\n\t\t     foreground call is made (i.e., resultvar is not\n\t\t     provided), and this option is not provided or is set to\n\t\t     throw, then error will be invoked instead.\n\n       Once the call to S3::REST completes, a new dict is returned, either in\n       the resultvar or as the result of execution. This dict is a copy of the\n       original dict with the results added as new keys. The possible new keys\n       are these:\n\n\t      error errorstring\n\n\t      errorInfo errorstring\n\n\t      errorCode errorstring\n\t\t     If an error is caught, these three keys will be set in\n\t\t     the result.  Note that S3::REST does not consider a\n\t\t     non-2XX HTTP return code as an error. The errorCode value\n\t\t     will be formatted according to the ERROR REPORTING\n\t\t     description.  If these are present, other keys described\n\t\t     here might not be.\n\n\t      httpstatus threedigits\n\t\t     The three-digit code from the HTTP transaction. 2XX for\n\t\t     good, 5XX for server error, etc.\n\n\t      httpmessage text\n\t\t     The textual result after the status code. \"OK\" or\n\t\t     \"Forbidden\" or etc.\n\n\t      outbody contentstring\n\t\t     If outchan was not specified, this key will hold a\n\t\t     reference to the (unencoded) contents of the body\n\t\t     returned.\tIf Amazon returned an error (a la the\n\t\t     httpstatus not a 2XX value), the error message will be in\n\t\t     outbody or written to outchan as appropriate.\n\n\t      outheaders dict\n\t\t     This contains a dictionary of headers returned by Amazon.\n\t\t     The keys are always lower case. It's mainly useful for\n\t\t     finding the x-amz-meta-* headers, if any, although things\n\t\t     like last-modified and content-type are also useful.  The\n\t\t     keys of this dictionary are always lower case.  Both keys\n\t\t     and values are trimmed of extraneous whitespace.\n\nHIGH LEVEL COMMANDS\n       The routines in this section all make use of one or more calls to\n       S3::REST to do their work, then parse and manage the data in a\n       convenient way.\tAll these commands throw errors as described in ERROR\n       REPORTING unless otherwise noted.\n\n       In all these commands, all arguments are presented as name/value pairs,\n       in any order. All the argument names start with a hyphen.\n\n       There are a few options that are common to many of the commands, and\n       those common options are documented here.\n\n       -blocking boolean\n\t      If provided and specified as false, then any calls to S3:REST\n\t      will be non-blocking, and internally these routines will call\n\t      [vwait] to get the results. In other words, these routines will\n\t      return the same value, but they'll have event loops running\n\t      while waiting for Amazon.\n\n       -parse-xml xmlstring\n\t      If provided, the routine skips actually communicating with\n\t      Amazon, and instead behaves as if the XML string provided was\n\t      returned as the body of the call. Since several of these\n\t      routines allow the return of data in various formats, this\n\t      argument can be used to parse existing XML to extract the bits\n\t      of information that are needed. It's also helpful for testing.\n\n       -bucket bucketname\n\t      Almost every high-level command needs to know what bucket the\n\t      resources are in. This option specifies that. (Only the command\n\t      to list available buckets does not require this parameter.)\n\t      This does not need to be URL-encoded, even if it contains\n\t      special or non-ASCII characters. May or may not contain leading\n\t      or trailing spaces - commands normalize the bucket. If this is\n\t      not supplied, the value is taken from S3::Configure -default-\n\t      bucket if that string isn't empty. Note that spaces and slashes\n\t      are always trimmed from both ends and the rest must leave a\n\t      valid bucket.\n\n       -resource resourcename\n\t      This specifies the resource of interest within the bucket.  It\n\t      may or may not start with a slash - both cases are handled.\n\t      This does not need to be URL-encoded, even if it contains\n\t      special or non-ASCII characters.\n\n       -compare always|never|exists|missing|newer|date|checksum|different\n\t      When commands copy resources to files or files to resources, the\n\t      caller may specify that the copy should be skipped if the\n\t      contents are the same. This argument specifies the conditions\n\t      under which the files should be copied. If it is not passed, the\n\t      result of S3::Configure -default-compare is used, which in turn\n\t      defaults to \"always.\" The meanings of the various values are\n\t      these:\n\n\t      always Always copy the data. This is the default.\n\n\t      never  Never copy the data. This is essentially a no-op, except\n\t\t     in S3::Push and S3::Pull where the -delete flag might\n\t\t     make a difference.\n\n\t      exists Copy the data only if the destination already exists.\n\n\t      missing\n\t\t     Copy the data only if the destination does not already\n\t\t     exist.\n\n\t      newer  Copy the data if the destination is missing, or if the\n\t\t     date on the source is newer than the date on the\n\t\t     destination by at least S3::Configure -slop-seconds\n\t\t     seconds. If the source is Amazon, the date is taken from\n\t\t     the Last-Modified header. If the source is local, it is\n\t\t     taken as the mtime of the file. If the source data is\n\t\t     specified in a string rather than a file, it is taken as\n\t\t     right now, via [clock seconds].\n\n\t      date   Like newer, except copy if the date is newer or older.\n\n\t      checksum\n\t\t     Calculate the MD5 checksum on the local file or string,\n\t\t     ask Amazon for the eTag of the resource, and copy the\n\t\t     data if they're different. Copy the data also if the\n\t\t     destination is missing. Note that this can be slow with\n\t\t     large local files unless the C version of the MD5 support\n\t\t     is available.\n\n\t      different\n\t\t     Copy the data if the destination does not exist.  If the\n\t\t     destination exists and an actual file name was specified\n\t\t     (rather than a content string), and the date on the file\n\t\t     differs from the date on the resource, copy the data.  If\n\t\t     the data is provided as a content string, the \"date\" is\n\t\t     treated as \"right now\", so it will likely always differ\n\t\t     unless slop-seconds is large.  If the dates are the same,\n\t\t     the MD5 checksums are compared, and the data is copied if\n\t\t     the checksums differ.\n\n       Note that \"newer\" and \"date\" don't care about the contents, and\n       \"checksum\" doesn't care about the dates, but \"different\" checks both.\n\n       S3::ListAllMyBuckets ?-blocking boolean? ?-parse-xml xmlstring?\n       ?-result-type REST|xml|pxml|dict|names|owner?\n\t      This routine performs a GET on the Amazon S3 service, which is\n\t      defined to return a list of buckets owned by the account\n\t      identified by the authorization header.

In this case, a non-2XX\n\t\t     httpstatus will not throw an error. You may not combine\n\t\t     this with -parse-xml.\n\n\t      -result-type xml\n\t\t     The raw XML of the body is returned as the result (with\n\t\t     no encoding applied).\n\n\t      -result-type pxml\n\t\t     The XML of the body as parsed by xsxp::parse is returned.\n\n\t      -result-type dict\n\t\t     A dictionary of interesting portions of the XML is\n\t\t     returned. The dictionary contains the following keys:\n\n\t\t     Owner/ID\n\t\t\t    The Amazon AWS ID (in hex) of the owner of the\n\t\t\t    bucket.\n\n\t\t     Owner/DisplayName\n\t\t\t    The Amazon AWS ID's Display Name.\n\n\t\t     Bucket/Name\n\t\t\t    A list of names, one for each bucket.\n\n\t\t     Bucket/CreationDate\n\t\t\t    A list of dates, one for each bucket, in the same\n\t\t\t    order as Bucket/Name, in ISO format (as returned\n\t\t\t    by Amazon)."

Again, no encoding is performed, and\n\t\t     the metadata should not contain characters like newlines,\n\t\t     carriage returns, and so on. It is best to stick with\n\t\t     simple ASCII strings, or to fix the library in several\n\t\t     places.\n\n\t      -content-type\n\t\t     This overrides the content-type calculated by -file or\n\t\t     sets the content-type for -content.\n\n\t      -compare\n\t\t     This is the standard compare mode argument.

(See S3::Sync for that.) Note too that resource names\n\t      are case sensitive, so changing the case of a file on a Windows\n\t      machine may lead to otherwise-unnecessary transfers.  Note that\n\t      only regular files are considered, so devices, pipes, symlinks,\n\t      and directories are not copied.\n\n\t      -bucket\n\t\t     This names the bucket into which data will be pushed.\n\n\t      -directory\n\t\t     This names the local directory from which files will be\n\t\t     taken.

That is, it is the remote equivalent of\n\t\t     -directory.  If it is not specified, the root of the\n\t\t     bucket will be treated as the remote directory.

If true, resources in the\n\t\t     destination that are not in the source directory are\n\t\t     deleted with S3::Delete.  Since only regular files are\n\t\t     considered, the existance of a symlink, pipe, device, or\n\t\t     directory in the local source will not prevent the\n\t\t     deletion of a remote resource with a corresponding name.\n\n\t      -error This controls the behavior of S3::Push in the event that\n\t\t     S3::Put throws an error. Note that errors encountered on\n\t\t     the local file system or in reading the list of resources\n\t\t     in the remote bucket always throw errors.\tThis option\n\t\t     allows control over \"partial\" errors, when some files\n\t\t     were copied and some were not.

When all files have been\n\t\t     transfered, the prefix may be invoked zero or more times\n\t\t     with delete as the first additional argument and the\n\t\t     suffix of the resource being deleted as the second\n\t\t     additional argument, with a third argument being either\n\t\t     an empty string (if the delete worked) or the errorCode\n\t\t     from S3::Delete if it failed. Finally, the prefix will be\n\t\t     invoked with finished as the first additional argument\n\t\t     and the return value as the second additional argument.\n       The return result from this command is a dictionary. They keys are the\n       suffixes (i.e., the common portion of the path after the -directory and\n       -prefix), while the values are either \"copied\", \"skipped\" (if -compare\n       indicated not to copy the file), or the errorCode thrown by S3::Put, as\n       appropriate. If -delete was true, there may also be entries for\n       suffixes with the value \"deleted\" or \"notdeleted\", indicating whether\n       the attempted S3::Delete worked or not, respectively. There is one\n       additional pair in the return result, whose key is the empty string and\n       whose value is a nested dictionary.  The keys of this nested dictionary\n       include \"filescopied\" (the number of files successfully copied),\n       \"bytescopied\" (the number of data bytes in the files copied, excluding\n       headers, metadata, etc), \"compareskipped\" (the number of files not\n       copied due to -compare mode), \"errorskipped\" (the number of files not\n       copied due to thrown errors), \"filesdeleted\" (the number of resources\n       deleted due to not having corresponding files locally, or 0 if -delete\n       is false), and \"filesnotdeleted\" (the number of resources whose\n       deletion was attempted but failed).\n\n       Note that this is currently implemented somewhat inefficiently.\tIt\n       fetches the bucket listing (including timestamps and eTags), then calls\n       S3::Put, which uses HEAD to find the timestamps and eTags again.\n       Correcting this with no API change is planned for a future upgrade."

The author, at this time, does not plan to\n\t      change this behavior. Welcome to Open Source.\n\n       •      S3::Sync is neither designed nor implemented yet.  The intention\n\t      would be to keep changes synchronised, so changes could be made\n\t      to both the bucket and the local directory and be merged by\n\t      S3::Sync.\n\n       •      Nor is -compare calc fully implemented. This is primarily due to\n\t      Windows not providing a convenient method for distinguishing\n\t      between local files that are \"public-read\" or \"public-read-\n\t      write\". Assistance figuring out TWAPI for this would be\n\t      appreciated. The U**X semantics are difficult to map directly as\n\t      well. See the source for details.  Note that there are not tests\n\t      for calc, since it isn't done yet.\n\n       •      The HTTP processing is implemented within the library, rather\n\t      than using a \"real\" HTTP package. Hence, multi-line headers are\n\t      not (yet) handled correctly. Do not include carriage returns or\n\t      linefeeds in x-amz-meta-* headers, content-type values, and so\n\t      on.  The author does not at this time expect to improve this.\n\n       •      Internally, S3::Push and S3::Pull and S3::Toss are all very\n\t      similar and should be refactored.\n\n       •      The idea of using -compare never -delete true to delete files\n\t      that have been deleted from one place but not the other yet not\n\t      copying changed files is untested.\n\nUSAGE SUGGESTIONS\n       To fetch a \"directory\" out of a bucket, make changes, and store it\n       back:\n\n       file mkdir ./tempfiles\n       S3::Pull -bucket sample -prefix of/interest -directory ./tempfiles \\\n\t -timestamp aws\n       do_my_process ./tempfiles other arguments\n       S3::Push -bucket sample -prefix of/interest -directory ./tempfiles \\\n\t -compare newer -delete true"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `S3`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nTo delete files locally that were deleted off of S3 but not otherwise\n       update files:\n\n       S3::Pull -bucket sample -prefix of/interest -directory ./myfiles \\\n\t -compare never -delete true\n\n\nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\n       The author intends to work on several additional projects related to\n       this package, in addition to finishing the unfinished features.\n\n       First, a command-line program allowing browsing of buckets and transfer\n       of files from shell scripts and command prompts is useful.\n\n       Second, a GUI-based program allowing visual manipulation of bucket and\n       resource trees not unlike Windows Explorer would be useful.\n\n       Third, a command-line (and perhaps a GUI-based) program called \"OddJob\"\n       that will use S3 to synchronize computation amongst multiple servers\n       running OddJob. An S3 bucket will be set up with a number of scripts to\n       run, and the OddJob program can be invoked on multiple machines to run\n       scripts on all the machines, each moving on to the next unstarted task\n       as it finishes each.  This is still being designed, and it is intended\n       primarily to be run on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud.\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.  Please report such in the category amazon-s3\n       of the Tcllib SF Trackers\n       [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also report\n       any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or\n       documentation.\n\nKEYWORDS\n       amazon, cloud, s3\n\nCATEGORY\n       Networking\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) Copyright 2006,2008 Darren New.
