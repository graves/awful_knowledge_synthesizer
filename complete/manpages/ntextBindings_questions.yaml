A few of these behave\n       in a way that is different from most contemporary text-editing\n       applications.  Ntext aims to provide more familiar behaviour.\n\n       Features of the Ntext bindings that differ from the default Text\n       bindings:\n\n       •      Clicking near the end of a (logical) line moves the cursor to\n\t      the end of that line (not the start of the next line).  If the\n\t      widget is in -wrap word mode, the same rule applies to display\n\t      lines.\n\n       •      Double-clicking or dragging near the end of a (logical) line\n\t      will highlight/select characters from the end of that line (not\n\t      the next line, or the region at the end of the line where there\n\t      are no characters).  If the widget is in -wrap word mode, the\n\t      same rule applies to display lines.\n\n       •      The End key implements \"Smart End\" (successive keypresses move\n\t      the cursor to the end of the display line, then to the end of\n\t      the logical line); the Home key implements \"Smart Home\" (which\n\t      is similar to \"Smart End\", but also toggles between the\n\t      beginning and end of leading whitespace).\n\n       •      When a selection exists, a <<Paste>> operation (e.g. <Control-\n\t      v>) overwrites the selection (as most editors do), and does so\n\t      on all platforms.\n\n       •      The <Insert> key toggles between \"Insert\" and \"Overwrite\" modes\n\t      for keyboard input.  (In contrast, the Text binding tag uses\n\t      <Insert> as a method to paste the \"primary selection\", a task\n\t      that can be accomplished instead by mouse middle-click.)\n\n       •      The <Escape> key clears the selection.\n\n       •      Selecting with <Shift-Button1> selects from the previous\n\t      position of the insertion cursor. (In the Text binding tag, the\n\t      selection anchor may be the position of the previous mouse\n\t      click.)\n\n       •      <Shift-Button1> operations do not alter the selection anchor.\n\t      (In the Text binding tag, they do.)\n\n       •      By default, the Ntext binding tag does not provide several of\n\t      the Control-key bindings supplied by the Text binding tag.\n\t      Modern keyboards offer alternatives, such as cursor keys for\n\t      navigation; modern applications often use the Control-key\n\t      bindings for other purposes (e.g. <Control-p> for \"print\").\n\n       The last three cases, the behavior of Text is often useful, so Ntext\n       gives you the option of retaining it, by setting variables defined in\n       the ::ntext namespace to 1 (instead of their default 0).  Explaining\n       these features in more detail:\n\n       •      If the mouse is clicked at position A, then the keyboard is used\n\t      to move the cursor to B, then shift is held down, and the mouse\n\t      is clicked at C: the Text binding tag gives a selection from A\n\t      to C; the Ntext gives a selection from B to C.  If you want\n\t      Ntext to behave like Text in this respect, set\n\t      ::ntext::classicMouseSelect to 1.\n\n       •      The Text binding tag allows successive <Shift-Button-1> events\n\t      to change both ends of the selection, by moving the selection\n\t      anchor to the end of the selection furthest from the mouse\n\t      click.  Instead, the Ntext binding tag fixes the anchor, and\n\t      multiple Shift-Button-1 events can only move the non-anchored\n\t      end of the selection.  If you want Ntext to behave like Text in\n\t      this respect, set ::ntext::classicAnchor to 1.  In both Text and\n\t      Ntext, keyboard navigation with the Shift key held down alters\n\t      the selection and keeps the selection anchor fixed.\n\n       •      The following \"extra\" Text bindings are switched off by default,\n\t      but can be activated in Ntext by setting ::ntext::classicExtras\n\t      to 1: <Control-a>, <Control-b>, <Control-d>, <Control-e>,\n\t      <Control-f>, <Control-h>, <Control-i>, <Control-k>, <Control-n>,\n\t      <Control-o>, <Control-p>, <Control-t>, <Control-space>,\n\t      <Control-Shift-space>.\n\nCONFIGURATION OPTIONS\n       Ntext provides alternatives to a number of behaviours of the classic\n       Text binding tag.  Where there is an option, the Ntext behaviour is\n       switched on by default, except for display-line indentation which is\n       discussed on a separate page at ntextIndent.\n\n       The behaviour of Ntext may be configured application-wide by setting\n       the values of a number of namespace variables:\n\n       ::ntext::classicAnchor\n\n       •      0 - (default value) selects Ntext behaviour, i.e. the anchor\n\t      point is fixed\n\n       •      1 - selects classic Text behaviour, i.e. the anchor point is\n\t      variable\n\n       ::ntext::classicExtras\n\n       •      0 - (default value) selects Ntext behaviour, i.e. several\n\t      \"extra\" Text bindings are de-activated\n\n       •      1 - selects classic Text behaviour, i.e. the \"extra\" Text\n\t      bindings are activated\n\n       ::ntext::classicMouseSelect\n\n       •      0 - (default value) selects Ntext behaviour, i.e. the anchor\n\t      point for mouse selection operations is moved by keyboard\n\t      navigation\n\n       •      1 - selects classic Text behaviour\n\n       ::ntext::overwrite\n\n       •      0 - (initial value) text typed at the keyboard is inserted into\n\t      the widget\n\n       •      1 - text typed at the keyboard overwrites text already in the\n\t      widget\n\n       •      The value is toggled by the Insert key.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       To use Ntext but keep classic Text 's variable-anchor feature:\n\n       package require ntext\n       text .t\n       set ::ntext::classicAnchor 1\n       bindtags .t {.t Ntext . all}"
