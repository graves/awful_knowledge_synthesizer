    NAME
           perl5100delta - what is new for perl 5.10.0

    DESCRIPTION
           This document describes the differences between the 5.8.8 release and
           the 5.10.0 release.

           Many of the bug fixes in 5.10.0 were already seen in the 5.8.X
           maintenance releases; they are not duplicated here and are documented
           in the set of man pages named perl58[1-8]?delta.

    Core Enhancements
       The "feature" pragma
           The "feature" pragma is used to enable new syntax that would break
           Perl's backwards-compatibility with older releases of the language.
           It's a lexical pragma, like "strict" or "warnings".

           Currently the following new features are available: "switch" (adds a
           switch statement), "say" (adds a "say" built-in function), and "state"
           (adds a "state" keyword for declaring "static" variables). Those
           features are described in their own sections of this document.

           The "feature" pragma is also implicitly loaded when you require a
           minimal perl version (with the "use VERSION" construct) greater than,
           or equal to, 5.9.5. See feature for details.

The following\n       expression:\n\n\t   $a // $b\n\n       is merely equivalent to\n\n\t  defined $a ? $a : $b\n\n       and the statement\n\n\t  $c //= $d;\n\n       can now be used instead of\n\n\t  $c = $d unless defined $c;\n\n       The \"//\" operator has the same precedence and associativity as \"||\".\n       Special care has been taken to ensure that this operator Do What You\n       Mean while not breaking old code, but some edge cases involving the\n       empty regular expression may now parse differently.  See perlop for\n       details.\n\n   Switch and Smart Match operator\n       Perl 5 now has a switch statement. It's available when \"use feature\n       'switch'\" is in effect.

See \"Smart\n       matching in detail\" in perlsyn.\n\n       This feature was contributed by Robin Houston.\n\n   Regular expressions\n       Recursive Patterns\n\t   It is now possible to write recursive patterns without using the\n\t   \"(??{})\" construct. This new way is more efficient, and in many\n\t   cases easier to read.\n\n\t   Each capturing parenthesis can now be treated as an independent\n\t   pattern that can be entered by using the \"(?PARNO)\" syntax (\"PARNO\"\n\t   standing for \"parenthesis number\"). For example, the following\n\t   pattern will match nested balanced angle brackets:\n\n\t       /\n\t\t^\t\t       # start of line\n\t\t(\t\t       # start capture buffer 1\n\t\t   <\t\t       #   match an opening angle bracket\n\t\t   (?:\t\t       #   match one of:\n\t\t       (?>\t       #     don't backtrack over the inside of this group\n\t\t\t   [^<>]+      #       one or more non angle brackets\n\t\t       )\t       #     end non backtracking group\n\t\t   |\t\t       #     ... or ...\n\t\t       (?1)\t       #     recurse to bracket 1 and try it again\n\t\t   )*\t\t       #   0 or more times.\n\t\t   >\t\t       #   match a closing angle bracket\n\t\t)\t\t       # end capture buffer one\n\t\t$\t\t       # end of line\n\t       /x"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perl5100delta`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPCRE users should note that Perl's recursive regex feature allows\n\t   backtracking into a recursed pattern, whereas in PCRE the recursion\n\t   is atomic or \"possessive\" in nature.  As in the example above, you\n\t   can add (?>) to control this selectively.  (Yves Orton)\n\n       Named Capture Buffers\n\t   It is now possible to name capturing parenthesis in a pattern and\n\t   refer to the captured contents by name. The naming syntax is\n\t   \"(?<NAME>....)\".  It's possible to backreference to a named buffer\n\t   with the \"\\k<NAME>\" syntax. In code, the new magical hashes \"%+\"\n\t   and \"%-\" can be used to access the contents of the capture buffers.\n\n\t   Thus, to replace all doubled chars with a single copy, one could\n\t   write\n\n\t       s/(?<letter>.)\\k<letter>/$+{letter}/g\n\n\t   Only buffers with defined contents will be \"visible\" in the \"%+\"\n\t   hash, so it's possible to do something like\n\n\t       foreach my $name (keys %+) {\n\t\t   print \"content of buffer '$name' is $+{$name}\\n\";\n\t       }\n\n\t   The \"%-\" hash is a bit more complete, since it will contain array\n\t   refs holding values from all capture buffers similarly named, if\n\t   there should be many of them."

This is considered a feature. :-)\n\t   (Yves Orton)\n\n       Possessive Quantifiers\n\t   Perl now supports the \"possessive quantifier\" syntax of the \"atomic\n\t   match\" pattern. Basically a possessive quantifier matches as much\n\t   as it can and never gives any back. Thus it can be used to control\n\t   backtracking. The syntax is similar to non-greedy matching, except\n\t   instead of using a '?' as the modifier the '+' is used. Thus \"?+\",\n\t   \"*+\", \"++\", \"{min,max}+\" are now legal quantifiers.

See perlre for their descriptions. (Yves\n\t   Orton)\n\n       Relative backreferences\n\t   A new syntax \"\\g{N}\" or \"\\gN\" where \"N\" is a decimal integer allows\n\t   a safer form of back-reference notation as well as allowing\n\t   relative backreferences. This should make it easier to generate and\n\t   embed patterns that contain backreferences. See \"Capture buffers\"\n\t   in perlre. (Yves Orton)\n\n       \"\\K\" escape\n\t   The functionality of Jeff Pinyan's module Regexp::Keep has been\n\t   added to the core. In regular expressions you can now use the\n\t   special escape \"\\K\" as a way to do something like floating length\n\t   positive lookbehind. It is also useful in substitutions like:\n\n\t     s/(foo)bar/$1/g\n\n\t   that can now be converted to\n\n\t     s/foo\\Kbar//g\n\n\t   which is much more efficient. (Yves Orton)\n\n       Vertical and horizontal whitespace, and linebreak\n\t   Regular expressions now recognize the \"\\v\" and \"\\h\" escapes that\n\t   match vertical and horizontal whitespace, respectively. \"\\V\" and\n\t   \"\\H\" logically match their complements."

    UNITCHECK blocks
           "UNITCHECK", a new special code block has been introduced, in addition
           to "BEGIN", "CHECK", "INIT" and "END".

           "CHECK" and "INIT" blocks, while useful for some specialized purposes,
           are always executed at the transition between the compilation and the
           execution of the main program, and thus are useless whenever code is
           loaded at runtime. On the other hand, "UNITCHECK" blocks are executed
           just after the unit which defined them has been compiled. See perlmod
           for more information. (Alex Gough)

       New Pragma, "mro"
           A new pragma, "mro" (for Method Resolution Order) has been added. It
           permits to switch, on a per-class basis, the algorithm that perl uses
           to find inherited methods in case of a multiple inheritance hierarchy.
           The default MRO hasn't changed (DFS, for Depth First Search). Another
           MRO is available: the C3 algorithm. See mro for more information.
           (Brandon Black)

           Note that, due to changes in the implementation of class hierarchy
           search, code that used to undef the *ISA glob will most probably break.
           Anyway, undef'ing *ISA had the side-effect of removing the magic on the
           @ISA array and should not have been done in the first place. Also, the
           cache *::ISA::CACHE:: no longer exists; to force reset the @ISA cache,
           you now need to use the "mro" API, or more simply to assign to @ISA
           (e.g. with "@ISA = @ISA").

       state() variables
           A new class of variables has been introduced. State variables are
           similar to "my" variables, but are declared with the "state" keyword in
           place of "my". They're visible only in their lexical scope, but their

    MAD
           MAD, which stands for Miscellaneous Attribute Decoration, is a still-
           in-development work leading to a Perl 5 to Perl 6 converter. To enable
           it, it's necessary to pass the argument "-Dmad" to Configure. The
           obtained perl isn't binary compatible with a regular perl 5.10, and has
           space and speed penalties; moreover not all regression tests still pass
           with it. (Larry Wall, Nicholas Clark)

       kill() on Windows
           On Windows platforms, "kill(-9, $pid)" now kills a process tree.  (On
           Unix, this delivers the signal to all processes in the same process
           group.)

    Incompatible Changes
       Packing and UTF-8 strings
           The semantics of pack() and unpack() regarding UTF-8-encoded data has
           been changed. Processing is now by default character per character
           instead of byte per byte on the underlying encoding. Notably, code that
           used things like "pack("a*", $string)" to see through the encoding of
           string will now simply get back the original $string. Packed strings
           can also get upgraded during processing when you store upgraded
           characters. You can get the old behaviour by using "use bytes".

    Manpage text:

    To be consistent with pack(), the "C0" in unpack() templates indicates
           that the data is to be processed in character mode, i.e. character by
           character; on the contrary, "U0" in unpack() indicates UTF-8 mode,
           where the packed string is processed in its UTF-8-encoded Unicode form
           on a byte by byte basis. This is reversed with regard to perl 5.8.X,
           but now consistent between pack() and unpack().

           Moreover, "C0" and "U0" can also be used in pack() templates to specify
           respectively character and byte modes.

           "C0" and "U0" in the middle of a pack or unpack format now switch to
           the specified encoding mode, honoring parens grouping. Previously,
           parens were ignored.

           Also, there is a new pack() character format, "W", which is intended to
           replace the old "C". "C" is kept for unsigned chars coded as bytes in
           the strings internal representation. "W" represents unsigned (logical)
           character values, which can be greater than 255. It is therefore more
           robust when dealing with potentially UTF-8-encoded data (as "C" will
           wrap values outside the range 0..255, and not respect the string
           encoding).

    In practice, that means that pack formats are now encoding-neutral,
           except "C".

           For consistency, "A" in unpack() format now trims all Unicode
           whitespace from the end of the string. Before perl 5.9.2, it used to
           strip only the classical ASCII space characters.

       Byte/character count feature in unpack()
           A new unpack() template character, ".", returns the number of bytes or
           characters (depending on the selected encoding mode, see above) read so
           far.

       The $* and $# variables have been removed
           $*, which was deprecated in favor of the "/s" and "/m" regexp
           modifiers, has been removed.

           The deprecated $# variable (output format for numbers) has been
           removed.

           Two new severe warnings, "$#/$* is no longer supported", have been
           added.

       substr() lvalues are no longer fixed-length
           The lvalues returned by the three argument form of substr() used to be
           a "fixed length window" on the original string. In some cases this
           could cause surprising action at distance or other undefined behaviour.
           Now the length of the window adjusts itself to the length of the string
           assigned to it.

    Parsing of "-f _"
           The identifier "_" is now forced to be a bareword after a filetest
           operator. This solves a number of misparsing issues when a global "_"
           subroutine is defined.

       ":unique"
           The ":unique" attribute has been made a no-op, since its current
           implementation was fundamentally flawed and not threadsafe.

       Effect of pragmas in eval
           The compile-time value of the "%^H" hint variable can now propagate
           into eval("")uated code. This makes it more useful to implement lexical
           pragmas.

           As a side-effect of this, the overloaded-ness of constants now
           propagates into eval("").

       chdir FOO
           A bareword argument to chdir() is now recognized as a file handle.
           Earlier releases interpreted the bareword as a directory name.  (Gisle
           Aas)

       Handling of .pmc files
           An old feature of perl was that before "require" or "use" look for a
           file with a .pm extension, they will first look for a similar filename
           with a .pmc extension. If this file is found, it will be loaded in

    Previously, .pmc files were loaded only if more recent than the
           matching .pm file. Starting with 5.9.4, they'll be always loaded if
           they exist.

       $^V is now a "version" object instead of a v-string
           $^V can still be used with the %vd format in printf, but any character-
           level operations will now access the string representation of the
           "version" object and not the ordinals of a v-string.  Expressions like
           "substr($^V, 0, 2)" or "split //, $^V" no longer work and must be
           rewritten.

       @- and @+ in patterns
           The special arrays "@-" and "@+" are no longer interpolated in regular
           expressions. (Sadahiro Tomoyuki)

       $AUTOLOAD can now be tainted
           If you call a subroutine by a tainted name, and if it defers to an
           AUTOLOAD function, then $AUTOLOAD will be (correctly) tainted.  (Rick
           Delaney)

       Tainting and printf

    Removal of the bytecode compiler and of perlcc
           "perlcc", the byteloader and the supporting modules (B::C, B::CC,
           B::Bytecode, etc.) are no longer distributed with the perl sources.
           Those experimental tools have never worked reliably, and, due to the
           lack of volunteers to keep them in line with the perl interpreter
           developments, it was decided to remove them instead of shipping a
           broken version of those.  The last version of those modules can be
           found with perl 5.9.4.

           However the B compiler framework stays supported in the perl core, as
           with the more useful modules it has permitted (among others, B::Deparse
           and B::Concise).

    Manpage text:

    A new manual page, perlunifaq (the Perl Unicode FAQ), has been added
           (Juerd Waalboer).

           The perlcommunity manpage gives a description of the Perl community on
           the Internet and in real life. (Edgar "Trizor" Bering)

           The CORE manual page documents the "CORE::" namespace. (Tels)

           The long-existing feature of "/(?{...})/" regexps setting $_ and pos()
           is now documented.

    Performance Enhancements
       In-place sorting
           Sorting arrays in place ("@a = sort @a") is now optimized to avoid
           making a temporary copy of the array.

           Likewise, "reverse sort ..." is now optimized to sort in reverse,
           avoiding the generation of a temporary intermediate list.

       Lexical array access
           Access to elements of lexical arrays via a numeric constant between 0
           and 255 is now faster. (This used to be only the case for global
           arrays.)

       XS-assisted SWASHGET
           Some pure-perl code that perl was using to retrieve Unicode properties
           and transliteration mappings has been reimplemented in XS.

    Manpage text:

    Constant subroutines
           The interpreter internals now support a far more memory efficient form
           of inlineable constants. Storing a reference to a constant value in a
           symbol table is equivalent to a full typeglob referencing a constant
           subroutine, but using about 400 bytes less memory. This proxy constant
           subroutine is automatically upgraded to a real typeglob with subroutine
           if necessary.  The approach taken is analogous to the existing space
           optimisation for subroutine stub declarations, which are stored as
           plain scalars in place of the full typeglob.

           Several of the core modules have been converted to use this feature for
           their system dependent constants - as a result "use POSIX;" now takes
           about 200K less memory.

       "PERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV"
           The new compilation flag "PERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV", introduced as an
           option in perl 5.8.8, is turned on by default in perl 5.9.3. It
           prevents perl from creating an empty scalar with every new typeglob.
           See perl589delta for details.
