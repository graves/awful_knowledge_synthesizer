Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perl5162delta`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPERL5162DELTA(1)       Perl Programmers Reference Guide       PERL5162DELTA(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       perl5162delta - what is new for perl v5.16.2\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This document describes differences between the 5.16.1 release and the\n       5.16.2 release.\n\n       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.16.0, first read\n       perl5161delta, which describes differences between 5.16.0 and 5.16.1.\n\nIncompatible Changes\n       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.16.0 If any\n       exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See\n       \"Reporting Bugs\" below.\n\nModules and Pragmata\n   Updated Modules and Pragmata\n       •   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 2.70 to version\n\t   2.76.\n\nConfiguration and Compilation\n       •   configuration should no longer be confused by ls colorization\n\nPlatform Support\n   Platform-Specific Notes\n       AIX Configure now always adds -qlanglvl=extc99 to the CC flags on AIX\n\t   when using xlC.  This will make it easier to compile a number of\n\t   XS-based modules that assume C99 [perl #113778].\n\nSelected Bug Fixes\n       •   fix /\\h/ equivalence with /[\\h]/\n\n\t   see [perl #114220]\n\nKnown Problems\n       There are no new known problems.\n\nAcknowledgements\n       Perl 5.16.2 represents approximately 2 months of development since Perl\n       5.16.1 and contains approximately 740 lines of changes across 20 files\n       from 9 authors.\n\n       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant\n       community of users and developers. The following people are known to\n       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.16.2:\n\n       Andy Dougherty, Craig A. Berry, Darin McBride, Dominic Hargreaves,\n       Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Peter Martini, Ricardo Signes, Tony\n       Cook.\n\n       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically\n       generated from version control history. In particular, it does not\n       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who\n       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.\n\n       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,\n       please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.\n\nReporting Bugs\n       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles\n       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug\n       database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be\n       information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.\n\n       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug\n       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a\n       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output\n       of \"perl -V\", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by\n       the Perl porting team.\n\n       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it\n       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please\n       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed\n       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core\n       committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues,\n       figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to\n       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is\n       supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl\n       core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       The Changes file for an explanation of how to view exhaustive details\n       on what changed.\n\n       The INSTALL file for how to build Perl.\n\n       The README file for general stuff.\n\n       The Artistic and Copying files for copyright information.\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-19\t\t      PERL5162DELTA(1)"
