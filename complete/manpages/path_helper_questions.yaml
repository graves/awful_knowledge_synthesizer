(The MANPATH\n     environment variable will not be modified unless it is already set in the\n     environment.)\n\n     Files in these directories should contain one path element per line.\n\n     Prior to reading these directories, default PATH and MANPATH values are\n     obtained from the files /etc/paths and /etc/manpaths respectively.\n\n     Options:\n\n     -c      Generate C-shell commands on stdout.  This is the default if\n\t     SHELL ends with \"csh\".\n\n     -s      Generate Bourne shell commands on stdout.\tThis is the default if\n\t     SHELL does not end with \"csh\".\n\nNOTE\n     The path_helper utility should not be invoked directly.  It is intended\n     only for use by the shell profile."
