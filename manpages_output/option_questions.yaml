The add form of the command\n       adds a new option to the database.  Pattern contains the option being\n       specified, and consists of names and/or classes separated by asterisks\n       or dots, in the usual X format (see PATTERN FORMAT).  Value contains a\n       text string to associate with pattern;  this is the value that will be\n       returned in calls to Tk_GetOption or by invocations of the option get\n       command.  If priority is specified, it indicates the priority level for\n       this option (see below for legal values);  it defaults to interactive.\n       This command always returns an empty string."

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `option`.



    Manpage text:

    Each word in the pattern conventionally starts with either an upper-
           case letter (in which case it denotes the class of either a widget or
           an option) or any other character, when it denotes the name of a widget
           or option. The last word in the pattern always indicates the option;
           the preceding ones constrain which widgets that option will be looked
           for in.

           When two words are separated by a period, the latter widget must be a
           direct child of the former (or the option must apply to only the
           indicated widgets).  When two words are separated by an asterisk, any
           depth of widgets may lie between the former and latter widgets (and the
           option applies to all widgets that are children of the former widget).

           If the overall pattern is preceded by an asterisk, then the overall
           pattern applies anywhere it can throughout the whole widget hierarchy.
           Otherwise the first word of the pattern is matched against the name and
           class of the “.” toplevel, which are usually set by options to wish.
