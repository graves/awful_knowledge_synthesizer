Only\n       meaningful when the -undo option is true.  [-blockcursor blockCursor] Specifies│\n       a boolean that says whether the blinking insertion cursor should be     │\n       drawn as a character-sized rectangular block.  If false (the default) a │\n       thin vertical line is used for the insertion cursor.  [-endline endLine]\n\tSpecifies an integer line index representing the last line of the      │\n       underlying textual data store that should be contained in the widget.   │\n       This allows a text widget to reflect only a portion of a larger piece   │\n       of text.   Instead of an integer, the empty string can be provided to   │\n       this configuration option, which will configure the widget to end at    │\n       the very last line in the textual data store.  [-height height]\n       Specifies the desired height for the window, in units of characters in\n       the font given by the -font option.  Must be at least one.\n       [-inactiveselectbackground inactiveSelectBackground] Specifies the      │\n       colour to use for the selection (the sel tag) when the window does not  │\n       have the input focus.  If empty, {}, then no selection is shown when    │\n       the window does not have the focus.  [-maxundo maxUndo] Specifies the\n       maximum number of compound undo actions on the undo stack. A zero or a\n       negative value imply an unlimited undo stack.  [-spacing1 spacing1]\n       Requests additional space above each text line in the widget, using any\n       of the standard forms for screen distances.  If a line wraps, this\n       option only applies to the first line on the display.  This option may\n       be overridden with -spacing1 options in tags.  [-spacing2 spacing2] For\n       lines that wrap (so that they cover more than one line on the display)\n       this option specifies additional space to provide between the display\n       lines that represent a single line of text.  The value may have any of\n       the standard forms for screen distances.  This option may be overridden\n       with -spacing2 options in tags.\t[-spacing3 spacing3] Requests\n       additional space below each text line in the widget, using any of the\n       standard forms for screen distances.  If a line wraps, this option only\n       applies to the last line on the display.  This option may be overridden\n       with -spacing3 options in tags.\t[-startline startLine] Specifies an    │\n       integer line index representing the first line of the underlying        │\n       textual data store that should be contained in the widget.  This allows │\n       a text widget to reflect only a portion of a larger piece of text.      │\n       Instead of an integer, the empty string can be provided to this\t       │\n       configuration option, which will configure the widget to start at the   │\n       very first line in the textual data store.  [-state state] Specifies\n       one of two states for the text:\tnormal or disabled.  If the text is\n       disabled then characters may not be inserted or deleted and no\n       insertion cursor will be displayed, even if the input focus is in the\n       widget.\t[-tabs tabs] Specifies a set of tab stops for the window.  The\n       option's value consists of a list of screen distances giving the\n       positions of the tab stops, each of which is a distance relative to the\n       left edge of the widget (excluding borders, padding, etc).  Each\n       position may optionally be followed in the next list element by one of\n       the keywords left, right, center, or numeric, which specifies how to\n       justify text relative to the tab stop.  Left is the default; it causes\n       the text following the tab character to be positioned with its left\n       edge at the tab position.  Right means that the right edge of the text\n       following the tab character is positioned at the tab position, and\n       center means that the text is centered at the tab position.  Numeric\n       means that the decimal point in the text is positioned at the tab\n       position;  if there is no decimal point then the least significant\n       digit of the number is positioned just to the left of the tab position;\n       if there is no number in the text then the text is right-justified at\n       the tab position.  For example, “-tabs {2c left 4c 6c center}” creates\n       three tab stops at two-centimeter intervals;  the first two use left\n       justification and the third uses center justification.\n\n\t      If the list of tab stops does not have enough elements to cover\n\t      all of the tabs in a text line, then Tk extrapolates new tab\n\t      stops using the spacing and alignment from the last tab stop in\n\t      the list.  Tab distances must be strictly positive, and must\n\t      always increase from one tab stop to the next (if not, an error\n\t      is thrown).  The value of the tabs option may be overridden by\n\t      -tabs options in tags.\n\n\t      If no -tabs option is specified, or if it is specified as an\n\t      empty list, then Tk uses default tabs spaced every eight\n\t      (average size) characters.  To achieve a different standard\n\t      spacing, for example every 4 characters, simply configure the\n\t      widget with “-tabs \"[expr {4 * [font measure $font 0]}] left\"\n\t      -tabstyle wordprocessor”.\n       [-tabstyle tabStyle] Specifies how to interpret the relationship\n       between tab stops on a line and tabs in the text of that line.  The\n       value must be tabular (the default) or wordprocessor. Note that tabs\n       are interpreted as they are encountered in the text.  If the tab style\n       is tabular then the n'th tab character in the line's text will be\n       associated with the n'th tab stop defined for that line.  If the tab\n       character's x coordinate falls to the right of the n'th tab stop, then\n       a gap of a single space will be inserted as a fallback.\tIf the tab\n       style is wordprocessor then any tab character being laid out will use\n       (and be defined by) the first tab stop to the right of the preceding\n       characters already laid out on that line.  The value of the tabstyle\n       option may be overridden by -tabstyle options in tags.  [-undo undo]\n       Specifies a boolean that says whether the undo mechanism is active or\n       not.  [-width width] Specifies the desired width for the window in\n       units of characters in the font given by the -font option.  If the font\n       does not have a uniform width then the width of the character “0” is\n       used in translating from character units to screen units.  [-wrap wrap]\n       Specifies how to handle lines in the text that are too long to be\n       displayed in a single line of the text's window.  The value must be\n       none or char or word.  A wrap mode of none means that each line of text\n       appears as exactly one line on the screen;  extra characters that do\n       not fit on the screen are not displayed.  In the other modes each line\n       of text will be broken up into several screen lines if necessary to\n       keep all the characters visible.  In char mode a screen line break may\n       occur after any character; in word mode a line break will only be made\n       at word boundaries.\n______________________________________________________________________________"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tk_textCut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The text command creates a new window (given by the pathName argument)\n       and makes it into a text widget.  Additional options, described above,\n       may be specified on the command line or in the option database to\n       configure aspects of the text such as its default background color and\n       relief.\tThe text command returns the path name of the new window.\n\n       A text widget displays one or more lines of text and allows that text\n       to be edited.  Text widgets support four different kinds of annotations\n       on the text, called tags, marks, embedded windows or embedded images.\n       Tags allow different portions of the text to be displayed with\n       different fonts and colors.  In addition, Tcl commands can be\n       associated with tags so that scripts are invoked when particular\n       actions such as keystrokes and mouse button presses occur in particular\n       ranges of the text.  See TAGS below for more details.\n\n       The second form of annotation consists of floating markers in the text\n       called “marks”.\tMarks are used to keep track of various interesting\n       positions in the text as it is edited.  See MARKS below for more\n       details."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tk_textCut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe third form of annotation allows arbitrary windows to be embedded in\n       a text widget.  See EMBEDDED WINDOWS below for more details.\n\n       The fourth form of annotation allows Tk images to be embedded in a text\n       widget.\tSee EMBEDDED IMAGES below for more details.\n\n       The text widget also has a built-in undo/redo mechanism.  See THE UNDO\n       MECHANISM below for more details.\n\n       The text widget allows for the creation of peer widgets.  These are     │\n       other text widgets which share the same underlying data (text, marks,   │\n       tags, images, etc).  See PEER WIDGETS below for more details.\n\nINDICES\n       Many of the widget commands for texts take one or more indices as\n       arguments.  An index is a string used to indicate a particular place\n       within a text, such as a place to insert characters or one endpoint of\n       a range of characters to delete.  Indices have the syntax\n\t      base modifier modifier modifier ...\n       Where base gives a starting point and the modifiers adjust the index\n       from the starting point (e.g. move forward or backward one character).\n       Every index must contain a base, but the modifiers are optional.  Most  │\n       modifiers (as documented below) allow an optional submodifier.  Valid   │\n       submodifiers are any and display. If the submodifier is abbreviated,    │\n       then it must be followed by whitespace, but otherwise there need be no  │\n       space between the submodifier and the following modifier.  Typically    │\n       the display submodifier adjusts the meaning of the following modifier   │\n       to make it refer to visual or non-elided units rather than logical      │\n       units, but this is explained for each relevant case below.  Lastly,     │\n       where count is used as part of a modifier, it can be positive or        │\n       negative, so “base - -3 lines” is perfectly valid (and equivalent to    │\n       “base +3lines”)."

So, for example, the index “1.0   │\n       -1c +1c” refers to the index “2.0”.\t\t\t\t       │\n\n       Where modifiers result in index changes by display lines, display chars │\n       or display indices, and the base refers to an index inside an elided    │\n       tag, that base index is considered to be equivalent to the first        │\n       following non-elided index.\n\nTAGS\n       The first form of annotation in text widgets is a tag.  A tag is a\n       textual string that is associated with some of the characters in a\n       text.  Tags may contain arbitrary characters, but it is probably best\n       to avoid using the characters “ ” (space), +, or -: these characters\n       have special meaning in indices, so tags containing them cannot be used\n       as indices.  There may be any number of tags associated with characters\n       in a text.  Each tag may refer to a single character, a range of\n       characters, or several ranges of characters.  An individual character\n       may have any number of tags associated with it."

    The second purpose for tags is event bindings.  You can associate
           bindings with a tag in much the same way you can associate bindings
           with a widget class:  whenever particular X events occur on characters
           with the given tag, a given Tcl command will be executed.  Tag bindings
           can be used to give behaviors to ranges of characters; among other
           things, this allows hypertext-like features to be implemented.  For
           details, see the description of the “pathName tag bind” widget command
           below.  Tag bindings are shared between all peer widgets (including any │
           bindings for the special sel tag).

           The third use for tags is in managing the selection.  See THE SELECTION
           below.  With the exception of the special sel tag, all tags are shared  │
           between peer text widgets, and may be manipulated on an equal basis     │
           from any such widget.  The sel tag exists separately and independently  │

    MARKS
           The second form of annotation in text widgets is a mark.  Marks are
           used for remembering particular places in a text.  They are something
           like tags, in that they have names and they refer to places in the
           file, but a mark is not associated with particular characters.
           Instead, a mark is associated with the gap between two characters.
           Only a single position may be associated with a mark at any given time.
           If the characters around a mark are deleted the mark will still remain;
           it will just have new neighbor characters.  In contrast, if the
           characters containing a tag are deleted then the tag will no longer
           have an association with characters in the file.  Marks may be
           manipulated with the “pathName mark” widget command, and their current
           locations may be determined by using the mark name as an index in
           widget commands.

           Each mark also has a “gravity”, which is either left or right.  The
           gravity for a mark specifies what happens to the mark when text is
           inserted at the point of the mark.  If a mark has left gravity, then
           the mark is treated as if it were attached to the character on its
           left, so the mark will remain to the left of any text inserted at the
           mark position.  If the mark has right gravity, new text inserted at the
           mark position will appear to the left of the mark (so that the mark
           remains rightmost).  The gravity for a mark defaults to right.

    Manpage text:

    The name space for marks is different from that for tags:  the same
           name may be used for both a mark and a tag, but they will refer to
           different things.

           Two marks have special significance.  First, the mark insert is
           associated with the insertion cursor, as described under THE INSERTION
           CURSOR below.  Second, the mark current is associated with the
           character closest to the mouse and is adjusted automatically to track
           the mouse position and any changes to the text in the widget (one
           exception:  current is not updated in response to mouse motions if a
           mouse button is down;  the update will be deferred until all mouse
           buttons have been released).  Neither of these special marks may be
           deleted.  With the exception of these two special marks, all marks are  │
           shared between peer text widgets, and may be manipulated on an equal    │
           basis from any peer.

    EMBEDDED WINDOWS
           The third form of annotation in text widgets is an embedded window.
           Each embedded window annotation causes a window to be displayed at a
           particular point in  the text.  There may be any number of embedded
           windows in a text widget, and any widget may be used as an embedded
           window (subject to the usual rules for geometry management, which
           require the text window to be the parent of the embedded window or a
           descendant of its parent).  The embedded window's position on the
           screen will be updated as the text is modified or scrolled, and it will
           be mapped and unmapped as it moves into and out of the visible area of
           the text widget.  Each embedded window occupies one unit's worth of     │
           index space in the text widget, and it may be referred to either by the
           name of its embedded window or by its position in the widget's index
           space.  If the range of text containing the embedded window is deleted
           then the window is destroyed.  Similarly if the text widget as a whole  │
           is deleted, then the window is destroyed.

    EMBEDDED IMAGES
           The final form of annotation in text widgets is an embedded image.
           Each embedded image annotation causes an image to be displayed at a
           particular point in  the text.  There may be any number of embedded
           images in a text widget, and a particular image may be embedded in
           multiple places in the same text widget.  The embedded image's position
           on the screen will be updated as the text is modified or scrolled.
           Each embedded image occupies one unit's worth of index space in the     │
           text widget, and it may be referred to either by its position in the
           widget's index space, or the name it is assigned when the image is
           inserted into the text widget with pathName image create.  If the range
           of text containing the embedded image is deleted then that copy of the
           image is removed from the screen.

           When an embedded image is added to a text widget with the pathName

When creating a peer, a contiguous range of lines (e.g.    │\n       only lines 52 through 125) may be specified.  This allows a peer to     │\n       contain just a small portion of the overall text.  The range of lines   │\n       will expand and contract as text is inserted or deleted.  The peer will │\n       only ever display complete lines of text (one cannot share just part of │\n       a line).  If the peer's contents contracts to nothing (i.e. all\t       │\n       complete lines in the peer widget have been deleted from another        │\n       widget), then it is impossible for new lines to be inserted.

Note that a peer which    │\n       does not contain all of the underlying data store still has indices     │\n       numbered from “1.0” to “end”.  It is simply that those indices reflect  │\n       a subset of the total data, and data outside the contained range is not │\n       accessible to the peer.\tThis means that the command peerName index end │\n       may return quite different values in different peers.

If both index1 and\n\t      index2 are specified, then delete all the characters starting\n\t      with the one given by index1 and stopping just before index2\n\t      (i.e. the character at index2 is not deleted).

It is not allowable to\n\t      delete characters in a way that would leave the text without a\n\t      newline as the last character.  The command returns an empty\n\t      string.

They are sorted and the text is removed\n\t      from the last range to the first range so deleted text does not\n\t      cause an undesired index shifting side-effects.  If multiple\n\t      ranges with the same start index are given, then the longest\n\t      range is used.  If overlapping ranges are given, then they will\n\t      be merged into spans that do not cause deletion of text outside\n\t      the given ranges due to text shifted during deletion."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tk_textCut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n   ISSUES CONCERNING CHARS AND INDICES\n       Before Tk 8.5, the widget used the string “chars” to refer to index     │\n       positions (which included characters, embedded windows and embedded     │\n       images).  As of Tk 8.5 the text widget deals separately and correctly   │\n       with “chars” and “indices”.  For backwards compatibility, however, the  │\n       index modifiers “+N chars” and “-N chars” continue to refer to indices. │\n       One must use any of the full forms “+N any chars” or “-N any chars”     │\n       etc. to refer to actual character indices.  This confusion may be fixed │\n       in a future release by making the widget correctly interpret “+N chars” │\n       as a synonym for “+N any chars”.\n\n   PERFORMANCE ISSUES\n       Text widgets should run efficiently under a variety of conditions.  The\n       text widget uses about 2-3 bytes of main memory for each byte of text,\n       so texts containing a megabyte or more should be practical on most\n       workstations.  Text is represented internally with a modified B-tree\n       structure that makes operations relatively efficient even with large\n       texts.  Tags are included in the B-tree structure in a way that allows\n       tags to span large ranges or have many disjoint smaller ranges without\n       loss of efficiency.  Marks are also implemented in a way that allows\n       large numbers of marks.\tIn most cases it is fine to have large numbers\n       of unique tags, or a tag that has many distinct ranges."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tk_textCut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nOne performance problem can arise if you have hundreds or thousands of\n       different tags that all have the following characteristics: the first\n       and last ranges of each tag are near the beginning and end of the text,\n       respectively, or a single tag range covers most of the text widget.\n       The cost of adding and deleting tags like this is proportional to the\n       number of other tags with the same properties.  In contrast, there is\n       no problem with having thousands of distinct tags if their overall\n       ranges are localized and spread uniformly throughout the text.\n\n       Very long text lines can be expensive, especially if they have many\n       marks and tags within them.\n\n       The display line with the insert cursor is redrawn each time the cursor\n       blinks, which causes a steady stream of graphics traffic.  Set the\n       insertOffTime attribute to 0 avoid this.\n\n   KNOWN BUGS\n       The pathName search -regexp sub-command attempts to perform\t       │\n       sophisticated regexp matching across multiple lines in an efficient     │\n       fashion (since Tk 8.5), examining each line individually, and then in   │\n       small groups of lines, whether searching forwards or backwards.\tUnder  │\n       certain conditions the search result might differ from that obtained by │\n       applying the same regexp to the entire text from the widget in one go.  │\n       For example, when searching with a greedy regexp, the widget will       │\n       continue to attempt to add extra lines to the match as long as one of   │\n       two conditions are true: either Tcl's regexp library returns a code to  │\n       indicate a longer match is possible (but there are known bugs in Tcl    │\n       which mean this code is not always correctly returned); or if each      │\n       extra line added results in at least a partial match with the pattern.  │\n       This means in the case where the first extra line added results in no   │\n       match and Tcl's regexp system returns the incorrect code and adding a   │\n       second extra line would actually match, the text widget will return the │\n       wrong result.  In practice this is a rare problem, but it can occur,    │\n       for example:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       │\n\t      pack [text .t]\t\t\t\t\t\t       │\n       will not find a match when one exists of 19 characters starting from    │\n       the first “b”.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       │"

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tk_textCut`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nWhenever one possible match is fully enclosed in another, the search    │\n       command will attempt to ensure only the larger match is returned.  When │\n       performing backwards regexp searches it is possible that Tcl will not   │\n       always achieve this, in the case where a match is preceded by one or    │\n       more short, non-overlapping matches, all of which are preceded by a     │\n       large match which actually encompasses all of them.  The search\t       │\n       algorithm used by the widget does not look back arbitrarily far for a   │\n       possible match which might cover large portions of the widget.  For     │\n       example: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t       │\n\t      pack [text .t]\t\t\t\t\t\t       │\n       matches at “5.0” when a true greedy match would match at “1.0”.\t       │\n       Similarly if we add -all to this case, it matches at all of “5.0”,      │\n       “4.0”, “3.0” and “1.0”, when really it should only match at “1.0” since │\n       that match encloses all the others.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       entry(n), scrollbar(n)"
