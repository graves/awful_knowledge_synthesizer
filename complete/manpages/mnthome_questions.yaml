Since automount does not put up an authentication\n     dialog asking for an user name and password, automount mounts the\n     fileserver using guest login.  Thus you end up with getting the world\n     access privileges and the privileges are shown via \"mapping\".  You also\n     would have to allow guest access to the server to that sharepoint.\n\n     Mapping makes all the files/folders appear like they are owned by the\n     current user.  Even those items not really owned by the current user show\n     up as being owned by the current user.  The server provides user access\n     rights (UARights) which is a summary of what the access rights are\n     regardless of the category (owner, group, world) from which they were\n     obtained.\tWhen doing \"mapping\", the AppleShare client will take these\n     UARights and show them as the owner rights.  So, everything looks like it\n     is owned by the current user and the owner rights are set to the\n     UARights.\tThus if you had access to that file/folder before, then you\n     still do.\n\n     The options are:\n\n     -v      Display version number.\n\n     -d      Print debugging information.\n\n     -m      Alternative mount point is specified with the -m option followed\n\t     by a path to an existing directory.  Normally, the volume is\n\t     mounted in /Network/Servers/ or /var/automount/Network/Servers/.\n\n     -n      Do not force the unmount of the previous mount point.\n\n     -b      Exec the user's shell after mount of home.\n\n     -p      A password may be specified with the -p option followed by a\n\t     password.\tIf this option is not used, then the user will be\n\t     prompted to enter in a password.\n\n     -i      Display information about the AFP home mount point.\n\n     -u      Attempt to unmount the current home directory mount.\n\n     -x      This option must be followed by a path to an existing AFP mount\n\t     point.  Display information about the mount point.\n\n     -s      Skip preflight check to see if the currently mounted home\n\t     directory is already correctly mounted for the user.\n\nEXAMPLES\n     The following example illustrates how to mount an AFP home directory:\n\n\t   mnthome\n\n     This example shows how to print the debugging information and provide a\n     password:\n\n\t   mnthome -d -p foobar"

    BUGS
         I get the mounting url from the "home_loc" attribute and the mountpath
         from the "home" attribute (with the path from home_loc subtracted out).
         If your AFP home directory automounts in a different location, then you
         need to use the -m option to specify an alternative mount point.

         I cant figure out how to cd out of the current home dir so I can do the
         unmount and then restore the user back into the new home dir.  If you are
         in the AFP home directory when you use mnthome, you automatically get put
         back into that same directory when mnthome leaves.  If mnthome works,
         then your current directory is a dead directory and you need to "cd ~" to
         get to your new home directory.

         If the server with the home directory was already mounted by another
         user, you will not be able to replace it with a mount made by your user
         id.  The original mount must be first unmounted by the mounting user or
         root.
