A file event\n       handler is a binding between a channel and a script, such that the\n       script is evaluated whenever the channel becomes readable or writable.\n       File event handlers are most commonly used to allow data to be received\n       from another process on an event-driven basis, so that the receiver can\n       continue to interact with the user while waiting for the data to\n       arrive.\tIf an application invokes gets or read on a blocking channel\n       when there is no input data available, the process will block; until\n       the input data arrives, it will not be able to service other events, so\n       it will appear to the user to “freeze up”.  With fileevent, the process\n       can tell when data is present and only invoke gets or read when they\n       will not block.\n\n       The channelId argument to fileevent refers to an open channel such as a\n       Tcl standard channel (stdin, stdout, or stderr), the return value from\n       an invocation of open or socket, or the result of a channel creation\n       command provided by a Tcl extension.\n\n       If the script argument is specified, then fileevent creates a new event\n       handler:  script will be evaluated whenever the channel becomes\n       readable or writable (depending on the second argument to fileevent).\n       In this case fileevent returns an empty string.\tThe readable and\n       writable event handlers for a file are independent, and may be created\n       and deleted separately.\tHowever, there may be at most one readable and\n       one writable handler for a file at a given time in a given interpreter.\n       If fileevent is called when the specified handler already exists in the\n       invoking interpreter, the new script replaces the old one.\n\n       If the script argument is not specified, fileevent returns the current\n       script for channelId, or an empty string if there is none.  If the\n       script argument is specified as an empty string then the event handler\n       is deleted, so that no script will be invoked.  A file event handler is\n       also deleted automatically whenever its channel is closed or its\n       interpreter is deleted.\n\n       A channel is considered to be readable if there is unread data\n       available on the underlying device.  A channel is also considered to be\n       readable if there is unread data in an input buffer, except in the\n       special case where the most recent attempt to read from the channel was\n       a gets call that could not find a complete line in the input buffer.\n       This feature allows a file to be read a line at a time in nonblocking\n       mode using events.  A channel is also considered to be readable if an\n       end of file or error condition is present on the underlying file or\n       device.\tIt is important for script to check for these conditions and\n       handle them appropriately;  for example, if there is no special check\n       for end of file, an infinite loop may occur where script reads no data,\n       returns, and is immediately invoked again.\n\n       A channel is considered to be writable if at least one byte of data can\n       be written to the underlying file or device without blocking, or if an\n       error condition is present on the underlying file or device.\n\n       Event-driven I/O works best for channels that have been placed into\n       nonblocking mode with the fconfigure command.  In blocking mode, a puts\n       command may block if you give it more data than the underlying file or\n       device can accept, and a gets or read command will block if you attempt\n       to read more data than is ready;  no events will be processed while the\n       commands block.\tIn nonblocking mode puts, read, and gets never block.\n       See the documentation for the individual commands for information on\n       how they handle blocking and nonblocking channels.\n\n       The script for a file event is executed at global level (outside the\n       context of any Tcl procedure) in the interpreter in which the fileevent\n       command was invoked.  If an error occurs while executing the script\n       then the command registered with interp bgerror is used to report the\n       error.  In addition, the file event handler is deleted if it ever\n       returns an error;  this is done in order to prevent infinite loops due\n       to buggy handlers.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       In this setup GetData will be called with the channel as an argument\n       whenever $chan becomes readable.\n\t      proc GetData {chan} {\n\t\t  if {![eof $chan]} {\n\t\t      puts [gets $chan]\n\t\t  }\n\t      }\n\n\t      fileevent $chan readable [list GetData $chan]"
