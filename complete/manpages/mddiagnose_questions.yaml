A great deal\n     of information is harvested, spanning system state, system and Spotlight\n     details.\n\n   What mddiagnose Collects:\n\t   •   A spindump of the system\n\t   •   Several seconds of top output\n\t   •   Individual samples of mds and mdworker\n\t   •   Paths for all files used by Spotlight to contain its database\n\t       on every volume\n\t   •   All system logs\n\t   •   All spin and crash reports for the following processes:\n\t\t  mds\n\t\t  mdworker\n\n\t   •   Recent spin and crash reports for the following processes, for\n\t       all local users:\n\t\t  mds\n\t\t  mdworker\n\n\t   •   The query text and result quality statistics for recent\n\t       Spotlight searches.  The actual results of the searches are not\n\t       gathered\n\t   •   General information about disks and mounted network shares\n\t   •   The path of the last file indexed by each mdworker process on\n\t       behalf of Spotlight.  The path of the last file which resulted\n\t       in a crash of an mdworker process.  In each case, only the path\n\t       is gathered, not the contents of the file\n\t   •   Spotlight configuration for each volume currently mounted on\n\t       your system.  This includes the path and size of all files used\n\t       internally by Spotlight as well as a listing of paths that are\n\t       user excluded from indexing\n\t   •   Comprehensive information about internal state of Spotlight\n\n   What mddiagnose Doesn't Collect:\n\t   •   No user data is harvested from any volume\n\t   •   No paths or files found by any search are returned\n\t   •   No database storage or user files are returned\n\t   •   No authentication credentials are harvested from the system\n\nOPTIONS\n     -h      Print full usage.\n     -m      Gather a subset of the normal report.\n     -f path Write the diagnostic to the specified path.\n     -p path Gather Spotlight permissions and filter information.  Run as\n\t     owner of that file.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     mddiagnose exits with status 0 if there were no internal errors\n     encountered during the diagnostic, or >0 when an error unrelated to\n     external state occurs or unusable input is provided by the user.\n\nMac OS X\t\t\t 15 March 2011\t\t\t      Mac OS X"
