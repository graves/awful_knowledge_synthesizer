If a file\n       does not exist, bzmore looks for a file of the same name with the\n       addition of a .bz2 suffix.\n\n       Bzmore normally pauses after each screenful, printing --More-- at the\n       bottom of the screen.  If the user then types a carriage return, one\n       more line is displayed.\tIf the user hits a space, another screenful is\n       displayed.  Other possibilities are enumerated later.\n\n       Bzmore looks in the file /etc/termcap to determine terminal\n       characteristics, and to determine the default window size.  On a\n       terminal capable of displaying 24 lines, the default window size is 22\n       lines.  Other sequences which may be typed when bzmore pauses, and\n       their effects, are as follows (i is an optional integer argument,\n       defaulting to 1) :"
