    3. A count of total interrupt level wakeups which resulted in dispatching
         a thread from the process in question. For example, if a thread were
         blocked in a usleep() system call, a timer interrupt would cause that
         thread to be dispatched, and would increment this counter. For workloads
         with a significant idle component, this metric is useful to study in
         conjunction with the package idle exit metric reported below.

         4. A count of "package idle exits" induced by timers/device interrupts
         which awakened threads from the process in question. This is a subset of
         the interrupt wakeup count. Timers and other interrupts that trigger
         "package idle exits" have a greater impact on energy consumption relative
         to other interrupts. With the exception of some Mac Pro systems, Mac and
         iOS systems are typically single package systems, wherein all CPUs are
         part of a single processor complex (typically a single IC die) with
         shared logic that can include (depending on system specifics) shared last
         level caches, an integrated memory controller etc. When all CPUs in the
         package are idle, the hardware can power-gate significant portions of the
         shared logic in addition to each individual processor's logic, as well as
         take measures such as placing DRAM in to self-refresh (also referred to
         as auto-refresh), place interconnects into lower-power states etc. Hence
         a timer or interrupt that triggers an exit from this package idle state
         results in a a greater increase in power than a timer that occurred when
         the CPU in question was already executing. The process initiating a
         package idle wakeup may also be the "prime mover", i.e. it may be the
         trigger for further activity in its own or other processes. This metric
         is most useful when the system is relatively idle, as with typical light
         workloads such as web browsing and movie playback; with heavier
         workloads, the CPU activity can be high enough such that package idle
         entry is relatively rare, thus masking package idle exits due to the
         process/thread in question.

    5. If any processes arrived and vanished during the inter-sample
         interval, or a previously sampled process vanished, their statistics are
         reflected in the row labeled "DEAD_TASKS". This can identify issues
         involving transient processes which may be spawned too frequently. dtrace
         ("execsnoop") or other tools can then be used to identify the transient
         processes in question. Running powermetrics in coalition mode, (see
         below), will also help track down transient process issues, by billing
         the coalition to which the process belongs.

         Interrupt Distribution

         The interrupts sampler reports interrupt frequencies, classified by
         interrupt vector and associated device, on a per-CPU basis. Mac OS
         currently assigns all device interrupts to CPU0, but timers and
         interprocessor interrupts can occur on other CPUs. Interrupt frequencies
         can be useful in identifying misconfigured devices or areas of
         improvement in interrupt load, and can serve as a proxy for identifying
         device activity across the sample interval. For example, during a
         network-heavy workload, an increase in interrupts associated with Airport
         wireless ("ARPT"), or wired ethernet ("ETH0" "ETH1" etc.) is not
         unexpected. However, if the interrupt frequency for a given device is
         non-zero when the device is not active (e.g. if "HDAU" interrupts, for
         High Definition Audio, occur even when no audio is playing), that may be
         a driver error. The int_sources sampler attributes interrupts to the
         responsible InterruptEventSources, which helps disambiguate the cause of
         an interrupt if the vector serves more than one source.

    Battery Statistics

         The battery sampler reports battery discharge rates, current and maximum
         charge levels, cycle counts and degradation from design capacity across
         the interval in question, if a delta was reported by the battery
         management unit. Note that the battery controller data may arrive out-of-
         phase with respect to powermetrics samples, which can cause aliasing
         issues across short sample intervals. Discharge rates across
         discontinuities such as sleep/wake may also be inaccurate on some
         systems; however, the rate of change of the total charge level across
         longer intervals is a useful indicator of total system load. Powermetrics
         does not filter discharge rates for A/C connect/disconnect events, system
         sleep residency etc. Battery discharge rates are typically not comparable
         across machine models.

         Processor Energy Usage

         The cpu_power sampler reports data derived from the Intel energy models;
         as of the Sandy Bridge intel microarchitecture, the Intel power control
         unit internally maintains an energy consumption model whose details are
         proprietary, but are likely based on duty cycles for individual execution
         units, current voltage/frequency etc. These numbers are not strictly
         accurate but are correlated with actual energy consumption. This section
         lists: power dissipated by the processor package which includes the CPU
         cores, the integrated GPU and the system agent (integrated memory
         controller, last level cache), and separately, CPU core power and GT
         (integrated GPU) power (the latter two in a forthcoming version). The
         energy model data is generally not comparable across machine models.

    The cpu_power sampler next reports, on processors with Nehalem and newer
         microarchitectures, hardware derived processor frequency and idle
         residency information, labeled "P-states" and "C-states" respectively in
         Intel terminology.

         C-states are further classified in to "package c-states" and per-core C-
         states. The processor enters a "c-state" in the scheduler's idle loop,
         which results in clock-gating or power-gating CPU core and, potentially,
         package logic, considerably reducing power dissipation. High package c-
         state residency is a goal to strive for, as energy consumption of the CPU
         complex, integrated memory controller if any and DRAM is significantly
         reduced when in a package c-state. Package c-states occur when all CPU
         cores within the package are idle, and the on-die integrated GPU if any
         (SandyBridge mobile and beyond), on the system is also idle. Powermetrics
         reports package c-state residency as a fraction of the time sampled. This
         is available on Nehalem microarchitecture and newer processors. Note that
         some systems, such as Mac Pros, do not enable "package" c-states.

    Powermetrics also reports per-core c-state residencies, signifying when
         the core in question (which can include multiple SMTs or "hyperthreads")
         is idle, as well as active/inactive duty cycle histograms for each
         logical processor within the core. This is available on Nehalem
         microarchitecture and newer processors.

         This section also lists the average clock frequency at which the given
         logical processor executed when not idle within the sampled interval,
         expressed as both an absolute frequency in MHz and as a percentage of the
         nominal rated frequency. These average frequencies can vary due to the
         operating system's demand based dynamic voltage and frequency scaling.
         Some systems can execute at frequencies greater than the nominal or "P1"
         frequency, which is termed "turbo mode" on Intel systems. Such operation
         will manifest as > 100% of nominal frequency. Lengthy execution in turbo
         mode is typically energy inefficient, as those frequencies have high
         voltage requirements, resulting in a correspondingly quadratic increase
         in power insufficient to outweigh the reduction in execution time.
         Current systems typically have a single voltage/frequency domain per-
         package, but as the processors can execute out-of-phase, they may display
         different average execution frequencies.

    Disk Usage and Network Activity

         The network and disk samplers reports deltas in disk and network activity
         that occured during the sample. Also specifying --show-process-netstats
         and --show-process-io will give you this information on a per process
         basis in the tasks sampler.

         Backlight level

         The battery sampler also reports the instantaneous value of the backlight
         luminosity level. This value is likely not comparable across systems and
         machine models, but can be useful when comparing scenarios on a given
         system.

         Devices

         The devices sampler, for each device, reports the time spent in each of
         the device's states over the course of the sample. The meaning of the
         different states is specific to each device. Powermetrics denotes low
         power states with an "L", device usable states with a "U" and power on
         states with an "O".

    Thermal

         The thermal sampler displays the current thermal pressure the system is
         under. This is an instantaneous value taken at the end of the sample
         window, and does not necessarily reflect the value at other times in the
         window.

         SFI

         The sfi sampler shows system wide selective forced idle statistics.
         Selective forced idle is a mechanism the operating system uses to limit
         system power while minimizing user impact, by throttling certain threads
         on the system. Each thread belongs to an SFI class, and this sampler
         displays how much each SFI class is currently being throttled or empty if
         none of them is throttled. These are instantaneous values taken at the
         end of the sample window, and do not necessarily reflect the values at
         other times in the window. To get SFI wait time statistics on a per
         process basis use --show-process-wait-times.
