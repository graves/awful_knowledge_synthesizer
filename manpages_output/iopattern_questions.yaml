Uses DTrace.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       iopattern [-v] [-d device] [-f filename] [-m mount_point] [interval\n       [count]]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This prints details on the I/O access pattern for the disks, such as\n       percentage of events that were of a random or sequential nature.  By\n       default totals for all disks are printed.\n\n       An event is considered random when the heads seek. This program prints\n       the percentage of events that are random. The size of the seek is not\n       measured - it's either random or not.\n\n       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this\n       command.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -v     print timestamp, string\n\n       -d device\n\t      instance name to snoop (eg, dad0)\n\n       -f filename\n\t      full pathname of file to snoop\n\n       -m mount_point\n\t      mountpoint for filesystem to snoop\n\nEXAMPLES\n       Default output, print I/O summary every 1 second,\n\t      # iopattern\n\n       Print 10 second samples,\n\t      # iopattern 10\n\n       Print 12 x 5 second samples,\n\t      # iopattern 5 12\n\n       Snoop events on the root filesystem only,\n\t      # iopattern -m /\n\nFIELDS\n       %RAN   percentage of events of a random nature\n\n       %SEQ   percentage of events of a sequential nature\n\n       COUNT  number of I/O events\n\n       MIN    minimum I/O event size\n\n       MAX    maximum I/O event size\n\n       AVG    average I/O event size\n\n       KR     total kilobytes read during sample\n\n       KW     total kilobytes written during sample\n\n       DEVICE device name\n\n       MOUNT  mount point\n\n       FILE   filename (basename) for I/O operation\n\n       TIME   timestamp, string\n\nIDEA\n       Ryan Matteson\n\nDOCUMENTATION\n       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs\n       directory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with\n       verbose descriptions explaining the output.\n\nEXIT\n       iopattern will run forever until Ctrl-C is hit, or the specified count\n       is reached.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Brendan Gregg [Sydney, Australia]\n\nSEE ALSO\n       iosnoop(1M), iotop(1M), dtrace(1M)"
