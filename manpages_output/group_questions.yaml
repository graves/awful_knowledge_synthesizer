These fields are\n     as follows:\n\t   group     Name of the group.\n\t   passwd    Group's encrypted password.\n\t   gid\t     The group's decimal ID.\n\t   member    Group members.\n\n     The group field is the group name used for granting file access to users\n     who are members of the group.  The gid field is the number associated\n     with the group name.  They should both be unique across the system (and\n     often across a group of systems) since they control file access.  The\n     passwd field is an optional encrypted password.  This field is rarely\n     used and an asterisk is normally placed in it rather than leaving it\n     blank.  The member field contains the names of users granted the\n     privileges of group.  The member names are separated by commas without\n     spaces or newlines.  A user is automatically in a group if that group was\n     specified in their /etc/passwd entry and does not need to be added to\n     that group in the /etc/group file."
