ECHO_REQUEST\n     datagrams (“pings”) have an IP and ICMP header, followed by a “struct\n     timeval” and then an arbitrary number of “pad” bytes used to fill out the\n     packet.  The options are as follows:"

    Manpage text:

    This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably
         have to do a lot of testing to find it.  If you are lucky, you may manage
         to find a file that either cannot be sent across your network or that
         takes much longer to transfer than other similar length files.  You can
         then examine this file for repeated patterns that you can test using the
         -p option of ping.

    TTL DETAILS
         The TTL value of an IP packet represents the maximum number of IP routers
         that the packet can go through before being thrown away.  In current
         practice you can expect each router in the Internet to decrement the TTL
         field by exactly one.

         The TCP/IP specification recommends setting the TTL field for IP packets
         to 64, but many systems use smaller values (4.3BSD uses 30, 4.2BSD used
         15).

         The maximum possible value of this field is 255, and most UNIX systems
         set the TTL field of ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to 255.  This is why you
         will find you can “ping” some hosts, but not reach them with telnet(1) or
         ftp(1).
