Defaults to 0.  [-bordercursor borderCursor] Specifies the name\n       of the cursor to show when over borders, a visual indication that\n       interactive resizing is allowed (it is thus affect by the value of\n       -resizeborders).  Defaults to crosshair.  [-borderwidth or\n       -bd borderWidth] Specifies a non-negative pixel value or list of values\n       indicating the width of the 3-D border to draw on interior table cells\n       (if such a border is being drawn; the relief option typically\n       determines this).  If one value is specified, a rectangle of this width\n       will be drawn.  If two values are specified, then only the left and\n       right edges of the cell will have borders.  If four values are\n       specified, then the values correspond to the {left right top bottom}\n       edges.  This can be overridden by the a tag's borderwidth option.  It\n       can also be affected by the defined -drawmode for the table.  Each\n       value in the list must have one of the forms acceptable to\n       Tk_GetPixels.  [-browsecommand or -browsecmd browseCommand] Specifies a\n       command which will be evaluated anytime the active cell changes.  It\n       uses the %-substition model described in COMMAND SUBSTITUTION below.\n       Any changes to the active cell while the command is running are ignored\n       to prevent recursion.  [-cache cache] A boolean value that specifies\n       whether an internal cache of the table contents should be kept.\tThis\n       greatly enhances speed performance when used with -command but uses\n       extra memory.  Can maintain state when both -command and -variable are\n       empty.  The cache is automatically flushed whenever the value of -cache\n       or -variable changes, otherwise you have to explicitly call clear on\n       it.  Defaults to off.  [-colorigin colOrigin] Specifies what column\n       index to interpret as the leftmost column in the table.\tThis value is\n       used for user indices in the table.  Defaults to 0.  [-cols cols]\n       Number of cols in the table.  Defaults to 10.\n       [-colseparator colSeparator] Specifies a separator character that will\n       be interpreted as the column separator when cutting or pasting data in\n       a table.  By default, columns are separated as elements of a tcl list.\n       [-colstretchmode colStretchMode] Specifies one of the following stretch\n       modes for columns to fill extra allocated window space:\n\n\t      none   Columns will not stretch to fill the assigned window\n\t\t     space.  If the columns are too narrow, there will be a\n\t\t     blank space at the right of the table.  This is the\n\t\t     default.\n\n\t      unset  Only columns that do not have a specific width set will\n\t\t     be stretched.\n\n\t      all    All columns will be stretched by the same number of\n\t\t     pixels to fill the window space allocated to the table.\n\t\t     This mode can interfere with interactive border resizing\n\t\t     which tries to force column width.\n\n\t      last   The last column will be stretched to fill the window\n\t\t     space allocated to the table.\n\n\t      fill (only valid for -rowstretch currently)\n\t\t     The table will get more or less columns according to the\n\t\t     window space allocated to the table.  This mode has\n\t\t     numerous quirks and may disappear in the future.\n       [-coltagcommand colTagCommand] Provides the name of a procedure that\n       will be evaluated by the widget to determine the tag to be used for a\n       given column.  When displaying a cell, the table widget will first\n       check to see if a tag has been defined using the tag col widget method.\n       If no tag is found, it will evaluate the named procedure passing the\n       column number in question as the sole argument.\tThe procedure is\n       expected to return the name of a tag to use, or a null string.  Errors\n       occurring during the evaluation of the procedure, or the return of an\n       invalid tag name are silently ignored.  [-colwidth colWidth] Default\n       column width, interpreted as characters in the default font when the\n       number is positive, or pixels if it is negative.  Defaults to 10.\n       [-command command] Specified a command to use as a procedural interface\n       to cell values.\tIf -usecommand is true, this command will be used\n       instead of any reference to the -variable array.  When retrieving cell\n       values, the return value of the command is used as the value for the\n       cell.  It uses the %-substition model described in COMMAND SUBSTITUTION\n       below.  [-drawmode drawMode] Sets the table drawing mode to one of the\n       following options:\n\n\t      slow   The table is drawn to an offscreen pixmap using the Tk\n\t\t     bordering functions (double-buffering).  This means there\n\t\t     will be no flashing, but this mode is slow for larger\n\t\t     tables.\n\n\t      compatible\n\t\t     The table is drawn directly to the screen using the Tk\n\t\t     border functions.\tIt is faster, but the screen may flash\n\t\t     on update.  This is the default.\n\n\t      fast   The table is drawn directly to the screen and the borders\n\t\t     are done with fast X calls, so they are always one pixel\n\t\t     wide only.  As a side effect, it restricts -borderwidth\n\t\t     to a range of 0 or 1.  This mode provides best\n\t\t     performance for large tables, but can flash on redraw and\n\t\t     is not 100% Tk compatible on the border mode.\n\n\t      single The table is drawn to the screen as in fast mode, but\n\t\t     only single pixel lines are drawn (not square borders).\n       [-ellipsis ellipsis] This specifies a string to display at the end of a\n       line that would be clipped by its cell, like ``...''.  An ellipsis will\n       be displayed only on non-wrapping, non-multiline cells that would be\n       clipped.  The ellipsis will display on the left for east anchored\n       cells, otherwise it displays on the right.  Defaults to \"\" (no\n       ellipsis).  [-flashmode flashMode] A boolean value which specifies\n       whether cells should flash when their value changes.  The table tag\n       flash will be applied to these cells for the duration specified by\n       -flashtime.  Defaults to 0.  [-flashtime flashTime] The amount of time,\n       in 1/4 second increments, for which a cell should flash when its value\n       has changed.  -flashmode must be on.  Defaults to 2.  [-height height]\n       Specifies the desired height for the window, in rows.  If zero or less,\n       then the desired height for the window is made just large enough to\n       hold all the rows in the table.\tThe height can be further limited by\n       -maxheight.  [-invertselected invertSelected] Specifies whether the\n       foreground and background of an item should simply have their values\n       swapped instead of merging the sel tag options when the cell is\n       selected.  Defaults to 0 (merge sel tag).  [-ipadx ipadX] A pixel value\n       specifying the internal offset X padding for text in a cell.  This\n       value does not grow the size of the cell, it just causes the text to be\n       drawn further from the cell border.  It only affects one side\n       (depending on anchor).  Defaults to 0.  See -padx for an alternate\n       padding style.  [-ipady ipadY] A pixel value specifying the internal\n       offset Y padding for text in a cell.  This value does not grow the size\n       of the cell, it just causes the text to be drawn further from the cell\n       border.\tIt only affects one side (depending on anchor).  Defaults to\n       0.  See -pady for an alternate padding style.  [-justify justify] How\n       to justify multi-line text in a cell.  It must be one of left, right,\n       or center.  Defaults to left.  [-maxheight maxHeight] The max height in\n       pixels that the window will request.  Defaults to 600.\n       [-maxwidth maxWidth] The max width in pixels that the window will\n       request.  Defaults to 800.  [-multiline multiline] Specifies the\n       default setting for the multiline tag option.  Defaults to 1.\n       [-padx padX] A pixel value specifying the offset X padding for a cell.\n       This value causes the default size of the cell to increase by two times\n       the value (one for each side), unless a specific pixel size is chosen\n       for the cell with the width command.  This will force an empty area on\n       the left and right of each cell edge.  This padding affects all types\n       of data in the cell.  Defaults to 0.  See -ipadx for an alternate\n       padding style.  [-pady padY] A pixel value specifying the offset Y\n       padding for a cell.  This value causes the default size of the cell to\n       increase by two times the value (one for each side), unless a specific\n       pixel size is chosen for the cell with the height command.  This will\n       force an empty area on the top and bottom of each cell edge.  This\n       padding affects all types of data in the cell.  Defaults to 0.  See\n       -ipadx for an alternate padding style.  [-resizeborders resizeBorders]\n       Specifies what kind of interactive border resizing to allow, must be\n       one of row, col, both (default) or none.  [-rowheight rowHeight]\n       Default row height, interpreted as lines in the default font when the\n       number is positive, or pixels if it is negative.  Defaults to 1.\n       [-roworigin rowOrigin] Specifies what row index to interpret as the\n       topmost row in the table.  This value is used for user indices in the\n       table.  Defaults to 0.  [-rows rows] Number of rows in the table.\n       Defaults to 10.\t[-rowseparator rowSeparator] Specifies a separator\n       character that will be interpreted as the row separator when cutting or\n       pasting data in a table.  By default, rows are separated as tcl lists.\n       [-rowstretchmode rowStretchMode] Specifies the stretch modes for rows\n       to fill extra allocated window space.  See -colstretchmode for valid\n       options.  [-rowtagcommand rowTagCommand] Provides the name of a\n       procedure that can evaluated by the widget to determine the tag to be\n       used for a given row.  The procedure must be defined by the user to\n       accept a single argument (the row number), and return a tag name or\n       null string.  This operates in a similar manner as -coltagcommand,\n       except that it applies to row tags.  [-selectioncommand or\n       -selcmd selectionCommand] Specifies a command to evaluate when the\n       selection is retrieved from a table via the selection mechanism (ie:\n       evaluating ``selection get'').  The return value from this command will\n       become the string passed on by the selection mechanism.\tIt uses the\n       %-substition model described in COMMAND SUBSTITUTION below.  If an\n       error occurs, a Tcl background error is generated and nothing is\n       returned.  [-selectmode selectMode] Specifies one of several styles for\n       manipulating the selection.  The value of the option may be arbitrary,\n       but the default bindings expect it to be either single, browse,\n       multiple, or extended; the default value is browse.  These styles are\n       like those for the Tk listbox, except expanded for 2 dimensions.\n       [-selecttitle selectTitles] Specifies whether title cells should be\n       allowed in the selection.  Defaults to 0 (disallowed).\n       [-selecttype selectType] Specifies one of several types of selection\n       for the table.  The value of the option may be one of row, col, cell,\n       or both (meaning row && col); the default value is cell.  These types\n       define whether an entire row/col is affected when a cell's selection is\n       changed (set or clear).\t[-sparsearray sparseArray] A boolean value\n       that specifies whether an associated Tcl array should be kept as a\n       sparse array (1, the default) or as a full array (0).  If true, then\n       cell values that are empty will be deleted from the array (taking less\n       memory).  If false, then all values in the array will be maintained.\n       [-state state] Specifies one of two states for the entry:  normal or\n       disabled.  If the table is disabled then the value may not be changed\n       using widget commands and no insertion cursor will be displayed, even\n       if the input focus is in the widget.  Also, all insert or delete\n       methods will be ignored.  Defaults to normal.  [-titlecols titleCols]\n       Number of columns to use as a title area.  Defaults to 0.\n       [-titlerows titleRows] Number of rows to use as a title area.  Defaults\n       to 0.  [-usecommand useCommand] A boolean value which specifies whether\n       to use the command option.  This value sets itself to zero if command\n       is used and returns an error.  Defaults to 1 (will use command if\n       specified).  [-validate validate] A boolean specifying whether\n       validation should occur for the active buffer.  Defaults to 0.\n       [-validatecommand or -vcmd validateCommand] Specifies a command to\n       execute when the active cell is edited.\tThis command is expected to\n       return a Tcl boolean.  If it returns true, then it is assumed the new\n       value is OK, otherwise the new value is rejected (the edition will not\n       take place).  Errors in this command are handled in the background.  It\n       uses the %-substition model described in COMMAND SUBSTITUTION below.\n       [-variable variable] Global Tcl array variable to attach to the table's\n       C array.  It will be created if it doesn't already exist or is a simple\n       variable.  Keys used by the table in the array are of the form row,col\n       for cells and the special key active which contains the value of the\n       active cell buffer.  The Tcl array is managed as a sparse array (the\n       table does not require that all valid indices have values).  No stored\n       value for an index is equivalent to the empty string, and clearing a\n       cell will remove that index from the Tcl array, unless the -sparsearray\n       options is set to 0.  [-width width] Specifies the desired width for\n       the window, in columns.\tIf zero or less, then the desired width for\n       the window is made just large enough to hold all the columns in the\n       table.  The width can be further limited by -maxwidth.  [-wrap wrap]\n       Specifies the default wrap value for tags.  Defaults to 0.\n______________________________________________________________________________"

    DESCRIPTION
           The table command creates a 2-dimensional grid of cells.  The table can
           use a Tcl array variable or Tcl command for data storage and retrieval,
           as well as optionally cache data in memory for speed.  One of these
           data sources must be configured before any data is retained by the
           table.  The widget has an active cell, the contents of which can be
           edited (when the state is normal).  The widget supports a default style
           for the cells and also multiple tags, which can be used to change the
           style of a row, column or cell (see TAGS for details).  A cell flash
           can be set up so that changed cells will change color for a specified
           amount of time ("blink").  Cells can have embedded images or windows,
           as described in TAGS and "EMBEDDED WINDOWS" respectively.

           One or more cells may be selected as described below.  If a table is
           exporting its selection (see -exportselection option), then it will
           observe the standard X11 protocols for handling the selection.  See THE
           SELECTION for details.

           It is not necessary for all the cells to be displayed in the table
           window at once; commands described below may be used to change the view
           in the window.  Tables allow scrolling in both directions using the
           standard -xscrollcommand and -yscrollcommand options.  They also
           support scanning, as described below.

           In order to obtain good performance, the table widget supports multiple
           drawing modes, two of which are fully Tk compatible.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tkTable`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nINITIALIZATION\n       When the table command is loaded into an interpreter, a built-in Tcl\n       command, tkTableInit, is evaluated.  This will search for the\n       appropriate table binding init file to load.  The directories searched\n       are those in $tcl_pkgPath, both with Tktable(version) appended and\n       without, $tk_library and [pwd] (the current directory).\tYou can also\n       define an $env(TK_TABLE_LIBRARY) to head this search list.  By default,\n       the file searched for is called tkTable.tcl, but this can be overridden\n       by setting $env(TK_TABLE_LIBRARY_FILE).\n\n       This entire init script can be overridden by providing your own\n       tkTableInit procedure before the library is loaded.  Otherwise, the\n       aforementioned env(TK_TABLE_LIBRARY) variable will be set with the\n       directory in which $env(TK_TABLE_LIBRARY_FILE) was found.\n\n\nINDICES\n       Many of the widget commands for tables take one or more indices as\n       arguments.  An index specifies a particular cell of the table, in any\n       of the following ways:\n\n       number,number\n\t\t   Specifies the cell as a numerical index of row,col which\n\t\t   corresponds to the index of the associated Tcl array, where\n\t\t   -roworigin,-colorigin corresponds to the first cell in the\n\t\t   table (0,0 by default).  The values for row and column will\n\t\t   be constrained to actual values in the table, which means a\n\t\t   valid cell is always found.\n\n       active\t   Indicates the cell that has the location cursor.  It is\n\t\t   specified with the activate widget command.\n\n       anchor\t   Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set\n\t\t   with the selection anchor widget command.\n\n       bottomright Indicates the bottom-rightmost cell visible in the table.\n\n       end\t   Indicates the bottom right cell of the table.\n\n       origin\t   Indicates the top-leftmost editable cell of the table, not\n\t\t   necessarily in the display.\tThis takes into account the\n\t\t   user specified origin and title area.\n\n       topleft\t   Indicates the top-leftmost editable cell visible in the\n\t\t   table (this excludes title cells).\n\n       @x,y\t   Indicates the cell that covers the point in the table\n\t\t   window specified by x and y (in pixel coordinates).\tIf no\n\t\t   cell covers that point, then the closest cell to that point\n\t\t   is used.\n\n       In the widget command descriptions below, arguments named index, first,\n       and last always contain text indices in one of the above forms."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tkTable`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nTAGS\n       A tag is a textual string that is associated with zero or more rows,\n       columns or cells in a table.  Tags may contain arbitrary characters,\n       but it is probably best to avoid using names which look like indices to\n       reduce coding confusion.  A tag can apply to an entire row or column,\n       or just a single cell.  There are several permanent tags in each table\n       that can be configured by the user and will determine the attributes\n       for special cells:\n\n\t      active\tThis tag is given to the active cell\n\n\t      flash\tIf flash mode is on, this tag is given to any recently\n\t\t\tedited cells.\n\n\t      sel\tThis tag is given to any selected cells.\n\n\t      title\tThis tag is given to any cells in the title rows and\n\t\t\tcolumns.  This tag has -state disabled by default.\n\n       Tags control the way cells are displayed on the screen.\tWhere\n       appropriate, the default for displaying cells is determined by the\n       options for the table widget.  However, display options may be\n       associated with individual tags using the ``pathName tag configure''\n       widget command.\tIf a cell, row or column has been tagged, then the\n       display options associated with the tag override the default display\n       style.

Each\n       embedded window occupies one cell's worth of space in the table widget,\n       and it is referred to by the index of the cell in the table.  Windows\n       associated with the table widget are destroyed when the table widget is\n       destroyed.\n\n       Windows are used for display purposes only.  A value still exists for\n       that cell, but will not be shown unless the window is deleted in some\n       way.  If the window is destroyed or lost by the table widget to another\n       geometry manager, then any data associated with it is lost (the cell it\n       occupied will no longer appear in window names).\n\n       When an embedded window is added to a table widget with the window\n       configure widget command, several configuration options may be\n       associated with it.  These options may be modified with later calls to\n       the window configure widget command.  The following options are\n       currently supported:\n\n\t      -create script\n\t\t     NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED.

If\n\t\t     no -window option has been specified for this cell then\n\t\t     this script will be evaluated when the cell is about to\n\t\t     be displayed on the screen.  Script must create a window\n\t\t     for the cell and return the name of that window as its\n\t\t     result.  If the cell's window should ever be deleted, the\n\t\t     script will be evaluated again the next time the cell is\n\t\t     displayed.\n\n\t      -background or -bg color\n\t\t     Background color of the cell.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tkTable`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nTHE SELECTION\n       Table selections are available as type STRING.  By default, the value\n       of the selection will be the values of the selected cells in nested Tcl\n       list form where each row is a list and each column is an element of a\n       row list.  You can change the way this value is interpreted by setting\n       the -rowseparator and -colseparator options.  For example, default\n       Excel format would be to set -rowseparator to '\\n' and -colseparator to\n       '\\t'.  Changing these values affects both how the table sends out the\n       selection and reads in pasted data, ensuring that the table should\n       always be able to cut and paste to itself.  It is possible to change\n       how pastes are handled by editing the table library procedure\n       tk_tablePasteHandler.  This might be necessary if -selectioncommand is\n       set.\n\n\nROW/COL SPANNING\n       Individual cells can span multiple rows and/or columns.\tThis is done\n       via the spans command (see below for exact arguments).  Cells in the\n       title area that span are not permitted to span beyond the title area,\n       and will be constrained accordingly.  If the title area shrinks during\n       a configure, sanity checking will occur to ensure the above.  You may\n       set spans on regular cells that extend beyond the defined row/col area.\n       These spans will not be constrained, so that when the defined row/col\n       area expands, the span will expand with it.\n\n       When setting a span, checks are made as to whether the span would\n       overlap an already spanning or hidden cell.  This is an error and it\n       not allowed.  Spans can affect the overall speed of table drawing,\n       although not significantly.  If spans are not used, then there is no\n       performance loss.\n\n       Cells hidden by spanning cells still have valid data.  This will be\n       seen during cut and paste operations that involve hidden cells, or\n       through direct access by a command like get or set.\n\n       The drawing properties of spanning cells apply to only the visual area\n       of the cell.  For example, if a cell is center justified over 5\n       columns, then when viewing any portion of those columns, it will appear\n       centered in the visible area. The non-visible column area will not be\n       considered in the centering calculations."

The return value is an\n\t\t     empty string.\n\n       pathName see index\n\t      Adjust the view in the table so that the cell given by index is\n\t      positioned as the cell one off from top left (excluding title\n\t      rows and columns) if the cell is not currently visible on the\n\t      screen.  The actual cell may be different to keep the screen\n\t      full.\n\n       pathName selection option arg\n\t      This command is used to adjust the selection within a table.  It\n\t      has several forms, depending on option:\n\n\t      pathName selection anchor index\n\t\t     Sets the selection anchor to the cell given by index.\n\t\t     The selection anchor is the end of the selection that is\n\t\t     fixed while dragging out a selection with the mouse.  The\n\t\t     index anchor may be used to refer to the anchor cell.\n\n\t      pathName selection clear first ?last?\n\t\t     If any of the cells between first and last (inclusive)\n\t\t     are selected, they are deselected.  The selection state\n\t\t     is not changed for cells outside this range.  first may\n\t\t     be specified as all to remove the selection from all\n\t\t     cells.\n\n\t      pathName selection includes index\n\t\t     Returns 1 if the cell indicated by index is currently\n\t\t     selected, 0 if it isn't.\n\n\t      pathName selection set first ?last?\n\t\t     Selects all of the cells in the range between first and\n\t\t     last, inclusive, without affecting the selection state of\n\t\t     cells outside that range.\n\n       pathName set ?row|col? index ?value? ?index value ...?\n\t      Sets the specified index to the associated value.  Table\n\t      validation will not be triggered via this method.  If row or col\n\t      precedes the list of index/value pairs, then the value is\n\t      assumed to be a Tcl list whose values will be split and set into\n\t      the subsequent columns (if row is specified) or rows (for col).\n\t      For example, set row 2,3 {2,3 2,4 2,5} will set 3 cells, from\n\t      2,3 to 2,5.  The setting of cells is silently bounded by the\n\t      known table dimensions.\n\n       pathName spans ?index? ?rows,cols index rows,cols ...?\n\t      This command is used to manipulate row/col spans.  When called\n\t      with no arguments, all known spans are returned as a list of\n\t      tuples of the form {index span}.\tWhen called with only the\n\t      index, the span for that index only is returned, if any.\n\t      Otherwise an even number of index rows,cols pairs are used to\n\t      set spans.  A span starts at the index and continues for the\n\t      specified number of rows and cols.  Negative spans are not\n\t      supported.  A span of 0,0 unsets any span on that cell.  See\n\t      EXAMPLES for more info.\n\n       pathName tag option ?arg arg ...?\n\t      This command is used to manipulate tags.\tThe exact behavior of\n\t      the command depends on the option argument that follows the tag\n\t      argument.  cget, cell, and row|col complain about unknown tag\n\t      names.  The following forms of the command are currently\n\t      supported:\n\n\t      pathName tag cell tagName ?index ...?\n\t\t     With no arguments, prints out the list of cells that use\n\t\t     the tag.  Otherwise it sets the specified cells to use\n\t\t     the named tag, replacing any tag that may have been set\n\t\t     using this method before.\tIf tagName is {}, the cells\n\t\t     are reset to the default tag.  Tags added during\n\t\t     -*tagcommand evaluation do not register here.  If tagName\n\t\t     does not exist, it will be created with the default\n\t\t     options.\n\n\t      pathName tag cget tagName option\n\t\t     This command returns the current value of the option\n\t\t     named option associated with the tag given by tagName.\n\t\t     Option may have any of the values accepted by the tag\n\t\t     configure widget command.\n\n\t      pathName tag col tagName ?col ...?\n\t\t     With no arguments, prints out the list of cols that use\n\t\t     the tag.  Otherwise it sets the specified columns to use\n\t\t     the named tag, replacing any tag that may have been set\n\t\t     using this method before.\tIf tagName is {}, the cols are\n\t\t     reset to the default tag.\tTags added during\n\t\t     -coltagcommand evaluation do not register here.  If\n\t\t     tagName does not exist, it will be created with the\n\t\t     default options.\n\n\t      pathName tag configure tagName ?option? ?value? ?option value\n\t      ...?   This command is similar to the configure widget command\n\t\t     except that it modifies options associated with the tag\n\t\t     given by tagName instead of modifying options for the\n\t\t     overall table widget.  If no option is specified, the\n\t\t     command returns a list describing all of the available\n\t\t     options for tagName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information\n\t\t     on the format of this list).  If option is specified with\n\t\t     no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t\t     one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t\t     corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option\n\t\t     is specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are\n\t\t     specified, then the command modifies the given option(s)\n\t\t     to have the given value(s) in tagName; in this case the\n\t\t     command returns an empty string.  See TAGS above for\n\t\t     details on the options available for tags.\n\n\t      pathName tag delete tagName\n\t\t     Deletes a tag.  No error if the tag does not exist.\n\n\t      pathName tag exists tagName\n\t\t     Returns 1 if the named tag exists, 0 otherwise.\n\n\t      pathName tag includes tagName index\n\t\t     Returns 1 if the specified index has the named tag, 0\n\t\t     otherwise.\n\n\t      pathName tag lower tagName ?belowThis?\n\t\t     Lower the priority of the named tag.  If belowThis is not\n\t\t     specified, then the tag's priority is lowered to the\n\t\t     bottom, otherwise it is lowered to one below belowThis.\n\n\t      pathName tag names ?pattern?\n\t\t     If no pattern is specified, shows the names of all\n\t\t     defined tags.  Otherwise the pattern is used as a glob\n\t\t     pattern to show only tags matching that pattern.  Tag\n\t\t     names are returned in priority order (highest priority\n\t\t     tag first).\n\n\t      pathName tag raise tagName ?aboveThis?\n\t\t     Raise the priority of the named tag.  If aboveThis is not\n\t\t     specified, then the tag's priority is raised to the top,\n\t\t     otherwise it is raised to one above aboveThis.\n\n\t      pathName tag row tagName ?row ...?\n\t\t     With no arguments, prints out the list of rows that use\n\t\t     the tag.  Otherwise it sets the specified rows to use the\n\t\t     named tag, replacing any tag that may have been set using\n\t\t     this method before.  If tagName is {}, the rows are reset\n\t\t     to use the default tag.  Tags added during -rowtagcommand\n\t\t     evaluation do not register here.  If tagName does not\n\t\t     exist, it will be created with the default options.\n\n       pathName validate index\n\t      Explicitly validates the specified index based on the current\n\t      -validatecommand and returns 0 or 1 based on whether the cell\n\t      was validated.\n\n       pathName width ?col? ?value col value ...?\n\t      If no col is specified, returns a list describing all cols for\n\t      which a width has been set.  If col is specified with no value,\n\t      it prints out the width of that col in characters (positive\n\t      number) or pixels (negative number).  If one or more col-value\n\t      pairs are specified, then it sets each col to be that width in\n\t      characters (positive number) or pixels (negative number).  If\n\t      value is default, then the col uses the default width, specified\n\t      by -colwidth.\n\n       pathName window option ?arg arg ...?\n\t      This command is used to manipulate embedded windows.  The exact\n\t      behavior of the command depends on the option argument that\n\t      follows the window argument.  The following forms of the command\n\t      are currently supported:\n\n\t      pathName window cget index option\n\t\t     This command returns the current value of the option\n\t\t     named option associated with the window given by index.\n\t\t     Option may have any of the values accepted by the window\n\t\t     configure widget command.\n\n\t      pathName window configure index ?option? ?value? ?option value\n\t      ...?   This command is similar to the configure widget command\n\t\t     except that it modifies options associated with the\n\t\t     embedded window given by index instead of modifying\n\t\t     options for the overall table widget.  If no option is\n\t\t     specified, the command returns a list describing all of\n\t\t     the available options for index (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t\t     information on the format of this list).  If option is\n\t\t     specified with no value, then the command returns a list\n\t\t     describing the one named option (this list will be\n\t\t     identical to the corresponding sublist of the value\n\t\t     returned if no option is specified).  If one or more\n\t\t     option-value pairs are specified, then the command\n\t\t     modifies the given option(s) to have the given value(s)\n\t\t     in index; in this case the command returns an empty\n\t\t     string.  See EMBEDDED WINDOWS above for details on the\n\t\t     options available for windows.\n\n\t      pathName window delete index ?index ...?\n\t\t     Deletes an embedded window from the table.  The\n\t\t     associated window will also be deleted.\n\n\t      pathName window move indexFrom indexTo\n\t\t     Moves an embedded window from one cell to another.  If a\n\t\t     window already exists in the target cell, it will be\n\t\t     deleted.\n\n\t      pathName window names ?pattern?\n\t\t     If no pattern is specified, shows the cells of all\n\t\t     embedded windows.\tOtherwise the pattern is used as a\n\t\t     glob pattern to show only cells matching that pattern.\n\n       pathName xview args\n\t      This command is used to query and change the horizontal position\n\t      of the information in the widget's window.  It can take any of\n\t      the following forms:\n\n\t      pathName xview\n\t\t     Returns a list containing two elements.  Each element is\n\t\t     a real fraction between 0 and 1;  together they describe\n\t\t     the horizontal span that is visible in the window.  For\n\t\t     example, if the first element is .2 and the second\n\t\t     element is .6, 20% of the table's text is off-screen to\n\t\t     the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and\n\t\t     40% of the text is off-screen to the right.  These are\n\t\t     the same values passed to scrollbars via the\n\t\t     -xscrollcommand option.\n\n\t      pathName xview index\n\t\t     Adjusts the view in the window so that the column given\n\t\t     by index is displayed at the left edge of the window.\n\n\t      pathName xview moveto fraction\n\t\t     Adjusts the view in the window so that fraction of the\n\t\t     total width of the table text is off-screen to the left.\n\t\t     fraction must be a fraction between 0 and 1.\n\n\t      pathName xview scroll number what\n\t\t     This command shifts the view in the window left or right\n\t\t     according to number and what.  Number must be an integer.\n\t\t     What must be either units or pages or an abbreviation of\n\t\t     one of these.  If what is units, the view adjusts left or\n\t\t     right by number cells on the display; if it is pages then\n\t\t     the view adjusts by number screenfuls.  If number is\n\t\t     negative then cells farther to the left become visible;\n\t\t     if it is positive then cells farther to the right become\n\t\t     visible.\n\n       pathName yview ?args?\n\t      This command is used to query and change the vertical position\n\t      of the text in the widget's window.  It can take any of the\n\t      following forms:\n\n\t      pathName yview\n\t\t     Returns a list containing two elements, both of which are\n\t\t     real fractions between 0 and 1.  The first element gives\n\t\t     the position of the table element at the top of the\n\t\t     window, relative to the table as a whole (0.5 means it is\n\t\t     halfway through the table, for example).  The second\n\t\t     element gives the position of the table element just\n\t\t     after the last one in the window, relative to the table\n\t\t     as a whole.  These are the same values passed to\n\t\t     scrollbars via the -yscrollcommand option.\n\n\t      pathName yview index\n\t\t     Adjusts the view in the window so that the row given by\n\t\t     index is displayed at the top of the window.\n\n\t      pathName yview moveto fraction\n\t\t     Adjusts the view in the window so that the element given\n\t\t     by fraction appears at the top of the window.  Fraction\n\t\t     is a fraction between 0 and 1;  0 indicates the first\n\t\t     element in the table, 0.33 indicates the element\n\t\t     one-third the way through the table, and so on.\n\n\t      pathName yview scroll number what\n\t\t     This command adjusts the view in the window up or down\n\t\t     according to number and what.  Number must be an integer.\n\t\t     What must be either units or pages.  If what is units,\n\t\t     the view adjusts up or down by number cells; if it is\n\t\t     pages then the view adjusts by number screenfuls.\tIf\n\t\t     number is negative then earlier elements become visible;\n\t\t     if it is positive then later elements become visible."
