The file output-file will be\n     created if it does not already exist.  If output-file does exist, its\n     messages will be included in the new output-file.\tIf set and message\n     numbers collide, the new message text defined in input-files... will\n     replace the old message text currently contained in output-file.\n\nINPUT FILES\n     The format of a message text source file is defined below.  Note that the\n     fields of a message text source line are separated by a single space\n     character: any other space characters are considered to be part of the\n     field contents.\n\n     $set n comment\n\t  This line specifies the set identifier of the following messages\n\t  until the next $set or end-of-file appears.  The argument n is the\n\t  set identifier which is defined as a number in the range [1,\n\t  (NL_SETMAX)].  Set identifiers must occur in ascending order within\n\t  a single source file, but need not be contiguous.  Any string\n\t  following a space following the set identifier is treated as a\n\t  comment.  If no $set directive  is specified in a given source file,\n\t  all messages will be located in the default message set NL_SETD."

  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using gencat to compile a message source file that includes a $set directive for set number 5?

The n\n\t  specifies a set number.  Any string following a space following the\n\t  set number is treated as a comment.\n\n     $ comment\n\t  A line beginning with $ followed by a space is treated as a comment.\n\n     m message-text\n\t  A message line consists of a message identifier m in the range [1,\n\t  (NL_MSGMAX)].  The message-text is stored in the message catalog\n\t  with the set identifier specified by the last $set directive, and\n\t  the message identifier m.  If the message-text is empty, and there\n\t  is a space character following the message identifier, an empty\n\t  string is stored in the message catalog.  If the message-text is\n\t  empty, and if there is no space character following the message\n\t  identifier, then the existing message in the current set with the\n\t  specified message identifier is deleted from the catalog.  Message\n\t  identifiers must be in ascending order within a single set, but need\n\t  not be contiguous.  The message-text length must be in the range [0,\n\t  (NL_TEXTMAX)]."
