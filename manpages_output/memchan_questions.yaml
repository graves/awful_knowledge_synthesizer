The package itself provides a number of in-memory channels\n       which can utilized to\n\n       •      capture stream-like information in a natural way instead of\n\t      using set and append to manipulate strings\n\n       •      or to transfer data between interpreters, in the same thread or\n\t      not.\n\nCOMMAND\n       memchan ?-initial-size len?\n\t      creates a chunk-oriented in-memory channel and returns its\n\t      handle. If an initial size is specified the system will pre-\n\t      allocate len bytes of buffer space for the contents. This is no\n\t      restriction on the ultimate size of the channel, it will always\n\t      grow as much as is necessary to accomodate the data written into\n\t      it.\n\n\t      The channels created here can be transfered between interpreters\n\t      in the same thread and between threads, but only as a whole. It\n\t      is not possible to use them to create a bi- or unidirectional\n\t      connection between two interpreters.\n\n       Memory channels created by memchan provide two read-only options which\n       can be queried via the standard fconfigure command. These are\n\n       -length\n\t      The value of this option is the number of bytes currently stored\n\t      in the queried memory channel.\n\n       -allocated\n\t      The value of this option is the number of bytes currently\n\t      allocated by the queried memory channel. This number is at least\n\t      as big as the value of -length.\n\n       As the channels generated by memchan grow as necessary they are always\n       writable. This means that a writable fileevent-handler will fire\n       continuously.\n\n       The channels are also readable if they contain more than zero bytes and\n       the seek location is not and the end of the channel. Under these\n       conditions a readable fileevent-handler will fire continuously.\n\n       Note that writing to such a channel usually occurs at the end, thus\n       supressing readable events. This also means that users have to take\n       care to seek the channel to a location before the end before trying to\n       read data back.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       fifo, fifo2, null, random, zero\n\nKEYWORDS\n       channel, chunk, i/o, in-memory channel, memchan\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 1996-2003 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
