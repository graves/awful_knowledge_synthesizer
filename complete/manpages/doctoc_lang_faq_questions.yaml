Such files can therefore serve as examples.\n\n       dtplite is distributed as part of Tcllib, so to get it you need one of\n\n       [1]    A CVS snapshot of Tcllib. How to retrieve such a snapshot and\n\t      the tools required for this are described at\n\t      http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=12883\n\n       [2]    A Tcllib release archive. They are available at\n\t      http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12883\n\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, will undoubtedly contain bugs and other problems.\n       Please report any such in the category doctools of the Tcllib SF\n       Trackers [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].  Please also\n       report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either the package\n       and/or the documentation.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       doctoc_lang_cmdref, doctoc_lang_intro, doctoc_lang_syntax\n\nKEYWORDS\n       doctoc commands, doctoc language, doctoc markup, doctoc syntax,\n       examples, faq, markup, semantic markup\n\nCATEGORY\n       Documentation tools\n\nCOPYRIGHT\n       Copyright (c) 2007 Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>"
