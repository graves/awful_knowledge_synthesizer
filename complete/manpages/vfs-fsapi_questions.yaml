(CAVEATS: Right\n       now vfs does not expose to Tcl all the permission-related flags of\n       glob).\n\n       vfshandler subcmd root relative actualpath args...\n\t      The first argument specifies the operation to perform on behalf\n\t      of the filesystem code in the tcl core, the remainder specify\n\t      the file path on which to operate, in different forms, and\n\t      parts, and any additional arguments which may be required to\n\t      carry out the action.\n\n\t      To demonstrate the treatment of a path by the generic layer we\n\t      use \"C:/foo/bar/mount.zip/xxx/yyy\" as an example and\n\t      additionally assume that the following conditions are true:\n\n\t      [1]    \"mount.zip\" is a zip archive which has been mounted on\n\t\t     top of itself,\n\n\t      [2]    said zip archive contains a file with path \"xxx/yyy\",\n\n\t      [3]    the current working directory of the application is\n\t\t     inside of directory \"xxx\",\n\n\t      [4]    and the command executed is file exists yyy.\n\n       The file separator between root and relative is omitted.  Most\n       filesystem operations need only the relative argument for their correct\n       operation, but some actually require the other parts of the path.\n\n\t      subcmd This argument of the handler can be one of the following\n\t\t     access, createdirectory, deletefile, fileattributes,\n\t\t     matchindirectory, open, removedirectory, stat, or utime.\n\n\t\t     The generic layer expects that the subcommands of a\n\t\t     handler signal error conditions by calling\n\t\t     vfs::filesystem posixerror with the appropriate posix\n\t\t     error code instead of throwing a tcl error. If the latter\n\t\t     is done nevertheless it will be treated as an unknown\n\t\t     posix error.\n\n\t\t     There are three exceptions to the rule above: If any of\n\t\t     open (when an interpreter is given), matchindirectory,\n\t\t     and fileattributes (for a set or get operation only)\n\t\t     throw a tcl error, this error will be passed up to the\n\t\t     caller of the filesystem command which invoked the\n\t\t     handler. Note that this does not preclude the ability of\n\t\t     these subcommands to use the command vfs::filesystem\n\t\t     posixerror to report more regular filesystem errors.\n\n\t      root   Part of the specification of the path to operate upon. It\n\t\t     contains the part of the path which lies outside this\n\t\t     filesystem's mount point. For example outlined above its\n\t\t     value will be \"C:/foo/bar/mount.zip\".\n\n\t      relative\n\t\t     Part of the specification of the path to operate upon. It\n\t\t     contains the part of the path which lies inside this\n\t\t     filesystem. For example outlined above its value will be\n\t\t     \"xxx/yyy\".\n\n\t      actualpath\n\t\t     Part of the specification of the path to operate upon. It\n\t\t     contains the original (unnormalized) name of the path\n\t\t     which was used in the current command wherever it\n\t\t     originated (in Tcl or C). For example outlined above its\n\t\t     value will be \"yyy\".\n\nHANDLER METHODS\n       vfshandler access root relative actualpath mode\n\t      Signal a posix error if the specified access mode (an integer\n\t      number) is not compatible with the file or directory described\n\t      by the path. The generic layer will ignore any non-empty return\n\t      value.\n\n\t      The command vfs::accessMode (see section HANDLER ENVIRONMENT)\n\t      can be used to convert the integer mode into an easier to check\n\t      string value.\n\n       vfshandler createdirectory root relative actualpath\n\t      Create a directory with the given name.  The command can assume\n\t      that all sub-directories in the path exist and are valid, and\n\t      that the actual desired path does not yet exist (Tcl takes care\n\t      of all of that for us).\n\n       vfshandler deletefile root relative actualpath\n\t      Delete the given file.\n\n       vfshandler fileattributes root relative actualpath ?index? ?value?\n\t      The command has to return a list containing the names of all\n\t      acceptable attributes, if neither index nor value were\n\t      specified.\n\n\t      The command has to return the value of the index'th attribute if\n\t      the index is specified, but not the value. The attributes are\n\t      counted in the same order as their names appear in the list\n\t      returned by a call where neither index nor value were specified.\n\t      The first attribute is has the index 0.\n\n\t      The command has to set the value of the index'th attribute to\n\t      value if both index and value were specified for the call.\n\n       vfshandler matchindirectory root relative actualpath pattern types\n\t      Return the list of files or directories in the given path which\n\t      match the glob pattern and are compatible with the specified\n\t      list of types. The specified path is always the name of an\n\t      existing directory.\n\n\t      Note: As Tcl generates requests for directory-only matches from\n\t      the filesystems involved when performing any type of recursive\n\t      globbing this subcommand absolutely has to handle such (and\n\t      file-only) requests correctly or bad things (TM) will happen.\n\n\t      The commands vfs::matchDirectories and vfs::matchFiles (see\n\t      section HANDLER ENVIRONMENT) can aid the implementation greatly\n\t      in this task.\n\n       vfshandler open root relative actualpath mode permissions\n\t      Either returns a list describing the successfully opened file,\n\t      or throws an error describing how the operation failed.\n\n\t      The list returned upon success contains at least one and at most\n\t      two elements. The first, obligatory, element is always the\n\t      handle of the channel which was created to allow access to the\n\t      contents of the file.\n\n\t      If specified the second element will be interpreted as a\n\t      callback, i.e. a command prefix. This prefix will always be\n\t      executed as is, i.e. without additional arguments. Any required\n\t      arguments have to be returned as part of the result of the call\n\t      to open.\n\n\t      If present the specified callback will be evaluated just before\n\t      the channel is closed by the generic filesystem layer. The\n\t      callback itself must not call close.\n\n\t      The channel however is live enough to allow seek and read\n\t      operations. In addition all available data will have been\n\t      flushed into it already. This means, for example, that the\n\t      callback can seek to the beginning of the said channel, read its\n\t      contents and then store the gathered data elsewhere. In other\n\t      words, this callback is not only crucial to the cleanup of any\n\t      resources associated with an opened file, but also for the\n\t      ability to implement a filesystem which can be written to.\n\n\t      Under normal circumstances return code and any errors thrown by\n\t      the callback itself are ignored. In that case errors have to be\n\t      signaled asychronously, for example by calling bgerror.  However\n\t      if, through a call of the subcommand internalerror, an error\n\t      handling script has been specified for the file system, all\n\t      errors thrown here will be passed to that script for further\n\t      action.\n\n\t      mode   can be any of r, w, a, w+, or a+.\n\n\t      permissions\n\t\t     determines the native mode the openend file is created\n\t\t     with. Relevant only of the open mode actually requests\n\t\t     the creation of a non-existing file, i.e. is not r."

Argument recursive is a boolean.
