To do so,\n       sncfgedit creates a temporary copy of the configuration file, and then\n       opens it in an editor.\n\n       sncfgedit uses the the EDITOR environment variable to choose the\n       program used to edit the configuration file, or vi if EDITOR is not\n       set.\n\n       Validation includes standalone validation of the new configuration file\n       as well as validation of changes between original configuration file\n       and edited file if a configuration file previously existed.  If no\n       previous configuration file exists, a template will be loaded into the\n       editor using default settings for all values."
