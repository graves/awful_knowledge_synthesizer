In addition some techniques for\n       coding callbacks are covered.\n\n       Examples where callbacks are necessary include\n\n       •    An Error Handler\n\n\t    You have created an XSUB interface to an application's C API.\n\n\t    A fairly common feature in applications is to allow you to define\n\t    a C function that will be called whenever something nasty occurs.\n\t    What we would like is to be able to specify a Perl subroutine that\n\t    will be called instead.\n\n       •    An Event-Driven Program\n\n\t    The classic example of where callbacks are used is when writing an\n\t    event driven program, such as for an X11 application.  In this\n\t    case you register functions to be called whenever specific events\n\t    occur, e.g., a mouse button is pressed, the cursor moves into a\n\t    window or a menu item is selected."

They are\n\n\t   I32 call_sv(SV* sv, I32 flags);\n\t   I32 call_pv(char *subname, I32 flags);\n\t   I32 call_method(char *methname, I32 flags);\n\t   I32 call_argv(char *subname, I32 flags, char **argv);\n\n       The key function is call_sv.  All the other functions are fairly simple\n       wrappers which make it easier to call Perl subroutines in special\n       cases. At the end of the day they will all call call_sv to invoke the\n       Perl subroutine."

    If you do not set this flag then it is very important that you make
           sure that any temporaries (i.e., parameters passed to the Perl
           subroutine and values returned from the subroutine) are disposed of
           yourself.  The section "Returning a Scalar" gives details of how to
           dispose of these temporaries explicitly and the section "Using Perl to
           Dispose of Temporaries" discusses the specific circumstances where you
           can ignore the problem and let Perl deal with it for you.

       G_NOARGS
           Whenever a Perl subroutine is called using one of the call_* functions,
           it is assumed by default that parameters are to be passed to the
           subroutine.  If you are not passing any parameters to the Perl
           subroutine, you can save a bit of time by setting this flag.  It has
           the effect of not creating the @_ array for the Perl subroutine.

           Although the functionality provided by this flag may seem
           straightforward, it should be used only if there is a good reason to do
           so.  The reason for being cautious is that, even if you have specified
           the G_NOARGS flag, it is still possible for the Perl subroutine that
           has been called to think that you have passed it parameters.

    This scenario will mostly be applicable to code that is meant to be
           called from within destructors, asynchronous callbacks, and signal
           handlers.  In such situations, where the code being called has little
           relation to the surrounding dynamic context, the main program needs to
           be insulated from errors in the called code, even if they can't be
           handled intelligently.  It may also be useful to do this with code for
           "__DIE__" or "__WARN__" hooks, and "tie" functions.

           The G_KEEPERR flag is meant to be used in conjunction with G_EVAL in
           call_* functions that are used to implement such code, or with
           "eval_sv".  This flag has no effect on the "call_*" functions when
           G_EVAL is not used.

           When G_KEEPERR is used, any error in the called code will terminate the
           call as usual, and the error will not propagate beyond the call (as
           usual for G_EVAL), but it will not go into $@.  Instead the error will
           be converted into a warning, prefixed with the string "\t(in cleanup)".
           This can be disabled using "no warnings 'misc'".  If there is no error,
           $@ will not be cleared.

Note that the stack is popped using \"POPs\" in the block where\n\t    \"SvTRUE(err_tmp)\" is true.\tThis is necessary because whenever a\n\t    call_* function invoked with G_EVAL|G_SCALAR returns an error, the\n\t    top of the stack holds the value undef. Because we want the\n\t    program to continue after detecting this error, it is essential\n\t    that the stack be tidied up by removing the undef.\n\n   Using G_KEEPERR\n       Consider this rather facetious example, where we have used an XS\n       version of the call_Subtract example above inside a destructor:\n\n\t   package Foo;\n\t   sub new { bless {}, $_[0] }\n\t   sub Subtract {\n\t       my($a,$b) = @_;\n\t       die \"death can be fatal\" if $a < $b;\n\t       $a - $b;\n\t   }\n\t   sub DESTROY { call_Subtract(5, 4); }\n\t   sub foo { die \"foo dies\"; }\n\n\t   package main;\n\t   {\n\t       my $foo = Foo->new;\n\t       eval { $foo->foo };\n\t   }\n\t   print \"Saw: $@\" if $@;\t      # should be, but isn't\n\n       This example will fail to recognize that an error occurred inside the\n       \"eval {}\".  Here's why: the call_Subtract code got executed while perl\n       was cleaning up temporaries when exiting the outer braced block, and\n       because call_Subtract is implemented with call_pv using the G_EVAL\n       flag, it promptly reset $@.  This results in the failure of the\n       outermost test for $@, and thereby the failure of the error trap.\n\n       Appending the G_KEEPERR flag, so that the call_pv call in call_Subtract\n       reads:\n\n\t       count = call_pv(\"Subtract\", G_EVAL|G_SCALAR|G_KEEPERR);\n\n       will preserve the error and restore reliable error handling.\n\n   Using call_sv\n       In all the previous examples I have 'hard-wired' the name of the Perl\n       subroutine to be called from C.\tMost of the time though, it is more\n       convenient to be able to specify the name of the Perl subroutine from\n       within the Perl script, and you'll want to use call_sv.\n\n       Consider the Perl code below\n\n\t   sub fred\n\t   {\n\t       print \"Hello there\\n\";\n\t   }\n\n\t   CallSubPV(\"fred\");\n\n       Here is a snippet of XSUB which defines CallSubPV.\n\n\t   void\n\t   CallSubPV(name)\n\t       char *  name\n\t       CODE:\n\t       PUSHMARK(SP);\n\t       call_pv(name, G_DISCARD|G_NOARGS);\n\n       That is fine as far as it goes. The thing is, the Perl subroutine can\n       be specified as only a string, however, Perl allows references to\n       subroutines and anonymous subroutines.  This is where call_sv is\n       useful.\n\n       The code below for CallSubSV is identical to CallSubPV except that the\n       \"name\" parameter is now defined as an SV* and we use call_sv instead of\n       call_pv.\n\n\t   void\n\t   CallSubSV(name)\n\t       SV *    name\n\t       CODE:\n\t       PUSHMARK(SP);\n\t       call_sv(name, G_DISCARD|G_NOARGS);\n\n       Because we are using an SV to call fred the following can all be used:\n\n\t   CallSubSV(\"fred\");\n\t   CallSubSV(\\&fred);\n\t   $ref = \\&fred;\n\t   CallSubSV($ref);\n\t   CallSubSV( sub { print \"Hello there\\n\" } );\n\n       As you can see, call_sv gives you much greater flexibility in how you\n       can specify the Perl subroutine.\n\n       You should note that, if it is necessary to store the SV (\"name\" in the\n       example above) which corresponds to the Perl subroutine so that it can\n       be used later in the program, it not enough just to store a copy of the\n       pointer to the SV. Say the code above had been like this:\n\n\t   static SV * rememberSub;\n\n\t   void\n\t   SaveSub1(name)\n\t       SV *    name\n\t       CODE:\n\t       rememberSub = name;\n\n\t   void\n\t   CallSavedSub1()\n\t       CODE:\n\t       PUSHMARK(SP);\n\t       call_sv(rememberSub, G_DISCARD|G_NOARGS);\n\n       The reason this is wrong is that, by the time you come to use the\n       pointer \"rememberSub\" in \"CallSavedSub1\", it may or may not still refer\n       to the Perl subroutine that was recorded in \"SaveSub1\".\tThis is\n       particularly true for these cases:\n\n\t   SaveSub1(\\&fred);\n\t   CallSavedSub1();\n\n\t   SaveSub1( sub { print \"Hello there\\n\" } );\n\t   CallSavedSub1();\n\n       By the time each of the \"SaveSub1\" statements above has been executed,\n       the SV*s which corresponded to the parameters will no longer exist.\n       Expect an error message from Perl of the form\n\n\t   Can't use an undefined value as a subroutine reference at ...\n\n       for each of the \"CallSavedSub1\" lines.\n\n       Similarly, with this code\n\n\t   $ref = \\&fred;\n\t   SaveSub1($ref);\n\t   $ref = 47;\n\t   CallSavedSub1();\n\n       you can expect one of these messages (which you actually get is\n       dependent on the version of Perl you are using)\n\n\t   Not a CODE reference at ...\n\t   Undefined subroutine &main::47 called ...\n\n       The variable $ref may have referred to the subroutine \"fred\" whenever\n       the call to \"SaveSub1\" was made but by the time \"CallSavedSub1\" gets\n       called it now holds the number 47. Because we saved only a pointer to\n       the original SV in \"SaveSub1\", any changes to $ref will be tracked by\n       the pointer \"rememberSub\". This means that whenever \"CallSavedSub1\"\n       gets called, it will attempt to execute the code which is referenced by\n       the SV* \"rememberSub\".  In this case though, it now refers to the\n       integer 47, so expect Perl to complain loudly.\n\n       A similar but more subtle problem is illustrated with this code:\n\n\t   $ref = \\&fred;\n\t   SaveSub1($ref);\n\t   $ref = \\&joe;\n\t   CallSavedSub1();\n\n       This time whenever \"CallSavedSub1\" gets called it will execute the Perl\n       subroutine \"joe\" (assuming it exists) rather than \"fred\" as was\n       originally requested in the call to \"SaveSub1\".\n\n       To get around these problems it is necessary to take a full copy of the\n       SV.  The code below shows \"SaveSub2\" modified to do that.\n\n\t   /* this isn't thread-safe */\n\t   static SV * keepSub = (SV*)NULL;\n\n\t   void\n\t   SaveSub2(name)\n\t       SV *    name\n\t       CODE:\n\t       /* Take a copy of the callback */\n\t       if (keepSub == (SV*)NULL)\n\t\t   /* First time, so create a new SV */\n\t\t   keepSub = newSVsv(name);\n\t       else\n\t\t   /* Been here before, so overwrite */\n\t\t   SvSetSV(keepSub, name);\n\n\t   void\n\t   CallSavedSub2()\n\t       CODE:\n\t       PUSHMARK(SP);\n\t       call_sv(keepSub, G_DISCARD|G_NOARGS);\n\n       To avoid creating a new SV every time \"SaveSub2\" is called, the\n       function first checks to see if it has been called before.  If not,\n       then space for a new SV is allocated and the reference to the Perl\n       subroutine \"name\" is copied to the variable \"keepSub\" in one operation\n       using \"newSVsv\".  Thereafter, whenever \"SaveSub2\" is called, the\n       existing SV, \"keepSub\", is overwritten with the new value using\n       \"SvSetSV\".\n\n       Note: using a static or global variable to store the SV isn't thread-\n       safe.  You can either use the \"MY_CXT\" mechanism documented in \"Safely\n       Storing Static Data in XS\" in perlxs which is fast, or store the values\n       in perl global variables, using get_sv(), which is much slower.\n\n   Using call_argv\n       Here is a Perl subroutine which prints whatever parameters are passed\n       to it.\n\n\t   sub PrintList\n\t   {\n\t       my(@list) = @_;\n\n\t       foreach (@list) { print \"$_\\n\" }\n\t   }\n\n       And here is an example of call_argv which will call PrintList.\n\n\t   static char * words[] = {\"alpha\", \"beta\", \"gamma\", \"delta\", NULL};\n\n\t   static void\n\t   call_PrintList()\n\t   {\n\t       call_argv(\"PrintList\", G_DISCARD, words);\n\t   }\n\n       Note that it is not necessary to call \"PUSHMARK\" in this instance.\n       This is because call_argv will do it for you.\n\n   Using call_method\n       Consider the following Perl code:\n\n\t   {\n\t       package Mine;\n\n\t       sub new\n\t       {\n\t\t   my($type) = shift;\n\t\t   bless [@_]\n\t       }\n\n\t       sub Display\n\t       {\n\t\t   my ($self, $index) = @_;\n\t\t   print \"$index: $$self[$index]\\n\";\n\t       }\n\n\t       sub PrintID\n\t       {\n\t\t   my($class) = @_;\n\t\t   print \"This is Class $class version 1.0\\n\";\n\t       }\n\t   }\n\n       It implements just a very simple class to manage an array.  Apart from\n       the constructor, \"new\", it declares methods, one static and one\n       virtual. The static method, \"PrintID\", prints out simply the class name\n       and a version number. The virtual method, \"Display\", prints out a\n       single element of the array.  Here is an all-Perl example of using it.\n\n\t   $a = Mine->new('red', 'green', 'blue');\n\t   $a->Display(1);\n\t   Mine->PrintID;\n\n       will print\n\n\t   1: green\n\t   This is Class Mine version 1.0\n\n       Calling a Perl method from C is fairly straightforward. The following\n       things are required:\n\n       •    A reference to the object for a virtual method or the name of the\n\t    class for a static method\n\n       •    The name of the method\n\n       •    Any other parameters specific to the method\n\n       Here is a simple XSUB which illustrates the mechanics of calling both\n       the \"PrintID\" and \"Display\" methods from C.\n\n\t   void\n\t   call_Method(ref, method, index)\n\t       SV *    ref\n\t       char *  method\n\t       int\t       index\n\t       CODE:\n\t       PUSHMARK(SP);\n\t       EXTEND(SP, 2);\n\t       PUSHs(ref);\n\t       PUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSViv(index)));\n\t       PUTBACK;\n\n\t       call_method(method, G_DISCARD);\n\n\t   void\n\t   call_PrintID(class, method)\n\t       char *  class\n\t       char *  method\n\t       CODE:\n\t       PUSHMARK(SP);\n\t       XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSVpv(class, 0)));\n\t       PUTBACK;\n\n\t       call_method(method, G_DISCARD);\n\n       So the methods \"PrintID\" and \"Display\" can be invoked like this:\n\n\t   $a = Mine->new('red', 'green', 'blue');\n\t   call_Method($a, 'Display', 1);\n\t   call_PrintID('Mine', 'PrintID');\n\n       The only thing to note is that, in both the static and virtual methods,\n       the method name is not passed via the stack--it is used as the first\n       parameter to call_method.\n\n   Using GIMME_V\n       Here is a trivial XSUB which prints the context in which it is\n       currently executing.\n\n\t   void\n\t   PrintContext()\n\t       CODE:\n\t       U8 gimme = GIMME_V;\n\t       if (gimme == G_VOID)\n\t\t   printf (\"Context is Void\\n\");\n\t       else if (gimme == G_SCALAR)\n\t\t   printf (\"Context is Scalar\\n\");\n\t       else\n\t\t   printf (\"Context is Array\\n\");\n\n       And here is some Perl to test it.\n\n\t   PrintContext;\n\t   $a = PrintContext;\n\t   @a = PrintContext;\n\n       The output from that will be\n\n\t   Context is Void\n\t   Context is Scalar\n\t   Context is Array\n\n   Using Perl to Dispose of Temporaries\n       In the examples given to date, any temporaries created in the callback\n       (i.e., parameters passed on the stack to the call_* function or values\n       returned via the stack) have been freed by one of these methods:\n\n       •    Specifying the G_DISCARD flag with call_*\n\n       •    Explicitly using the \"ENTER\"/\"SAVETMPS\"--\"FREETMPS\"/\"LEAVE\"\n\t    pairing\n\n       There is another method which can be used, namely letting Perl do it\n       for you automatically whenever it regains control after the callback\n       has terminated.\tThis is done by simply not using the\n\n\t   ENTER;\n\t   SAVETMPS;\n\t   ...\n\t   FREETMPS;\n\t   LEAVE;\n\n       sequence in the callback (and not, of course, specifying the G_DISCARD\n       flag).\n\n       If you are going to use this method you have to be aware of a possible\n       memory leak which can arise under very specific circumstances.  To\n       explain these circumstances you need to know a bit about the flow of\n       control between Perl and the callback routine.\n\n       The examples given at the start of the document (an error handler and\n       an event driven program) are typical of the two main sorts of flow\n       control that you are likely to encounter with callbacks.  There is a\n       very important distinction between them, so pay attention.\n\n       In the first example, an error handler, the flow of control could be as\n       follows.  You have created an interface to an external library.\n       Control can reach the external library like this\n\n\t   perl --> XSUB --> external library\n\n       Whilst control is in the library, an error condition occurs. You have\n       previously set up a Perl callback to handle this situation, so it will\n       get executed. Once the callback has finished, control will drop back to\n       Perl again.  Here is what the flow of control will be like in that\n       situation\n\n\t   perl --> XSUB --> external library\n\t\t\t     ...\n\t\t\t     error occurs\n\t\t\t     ...\n\t\t\t     external library --> call_* --> perl\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t |\n\t   perl <-- XSUB <-- external library <-- call_* <----+\n\n       After processing of the error using call_* is completed, control\n       reverts back to Perl more or less immediately.\n\n       In the diagram, the further right you go the more deeply nested the\n       scope is.  It is only when control is back with perl on the extreme\n       left of the diagram that you will have dropped back to the enclosing\n       scope and any temporaries you have left hanging around will be freed.\n\n       In the second example, an event driven program, the flow of control\n       will be more like this\n\n\t   perl --> XSUB --> event handler\n\t\t\t     ...\n\t\t\t     event handler --> call_* --> perl\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      |\n\t\t\t     event handler <-- call_* <----+\n\t\t\t     ...\n\t\t\t     event handler --> call_* --> perl\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      |\n\t\t\t     event handler <-- call_* <----+\n\t\t\t     ...\n\t\t\t     event handler --> call_* --> perl\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      |\n\t\t\t     event handler <-- call_* <----+\n\n       In this case the flow of control can consist of only the repeated\n       sequence\n\n\t   event handler --> call_* --> perl\n\n       for practically the complete duration of the program.  This means that\n       control may never drop back to the surrounding scope in Perl at the\n       extreme left.\n\n       So what is the big problem? Well, if you are expecting Perl to tidy up\n       those temporaries for you, you might be in for a long wait.  For Perl\n       to dispose of your temporaries, control must drop back to the enclosing\n       scope at some stage.  In the event driven scenario that may never\n       happen.\tThis means that, as time goes on, your program will create\n       more and more temporaries, none of which will ever be freed. As each of\n       these temporaries consumes some memory your program will eventually\n       consume all the available memory in your system--kapow!\n\n       So here is the bottom line--if you are sure that control will revert\n       back to the enclosing Perl scope fairly quickly after the end of your\n       callback, then it isn't absolutely necessary to dispose explicitly of\n       any temporaries you may have created. Mind you, if you are at all\n       uncertain about what to do, it doesn't do any harm to tidy up anyway.\n\n   Strategies for Storing Callback Context Information\n       Potentially one of the trickiest problems to overcome when designing a\n       callback interface can be figuring out how to store the mapping between\n       the C callback function and the Perl equivalent.\n\n       To help understand why this can be a real problem first consider how a\n       callback is set up in an all C environment.  Typically a C API will\n       provide a function to register a callback.  This will expect a pointer\n       to a function as one of its parameters.\tBelow is a call to a\n       hypothetical function \"register_fatal\" which registers the C function\n       to get called when a fatal error occurs.\n\n\t   register_fatal(cb1);\n\n       The single parameter \"cb1\" is a pointer to a function, so you must have\n       defined \"cb1\" in your code, say something like this\n\n\t   static void\n\t   cb1()\n\t   {\n\t       printf (\"Fatal Error\\n\");\n\t       exit(1);\n\t   }\n\n       Now change that to call a Perl subroutine instead\n\n\t   static SV * callback = (SV*)NULL;\n\n\t   static void\n\t   cb1()\n\t   {\n\t       dSP;\n\n\t       PUSHMARK(SP);\n\n\t       /* Call the Perl sub to process the callback */\n\t       call_sv(callback, G_DISCARD);\n\t   }"

Using a hash has the distinct advantage that\n       it allows an unlimited number of callbacks to be registered.\n\n       What if the interface provided by the C callback doesn't contain a\n       parameter which allows the file handle to Perl subroutine mapping?  Say\n       in the asynchronous i/o package, the callback function gets passed only\n       the \"buffer\" parameter like this\n\n\t   void\n\t   ProcessRead(buffer)\n\t   char *      buffer;\n\t   {\n\t       ...\n\t   }\n\n       Without the file handle there is no straightforward way to map from the\n       C callback to the Perl subroutine.\n\n       In this case a possible way around this problem is to predefine a\n       series of C functions to act as the interface to Perl, thus"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlcall`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nTo summarize, here are a number of possible methods for you to consider\n       for storing the mapping between C and the Perl callback\n\n       1. Ignore the problem - Allow only 1 callback\n\t    For a lot of situations, like interfacing to an error handler,\n\t    this may be a perfectly adequate solution.\n\n       2. Create a sequence of callbacks - hard wired limit\n\t    If it is impossible to tell from the parameters passed back from\n\t    the C callback what the context is, then you may need to create a\n\t    sequence of C callback interface functions, and store pointers to\n\t    each in an array.\n\n       3. Use a parameter to map to the Perl callback\n\t    A hash is an ideal mechanism to store the mapping between C and\n\t    Perl.\n\n   Alternate Stack Manipulation\n       Although I have made use of only the \"POP*\" macros to access values\n       returned from Perl subroutines, it is also possible to bypass these\n       macros and read the stack using the \"ST\" macro (See perlxs for a full\n       description of the \"ST\" macro)."

Notice that it was necessary to define the variable \"ax\".  This is\n\t    because the \"ST\" macro expects it to exist.

This\n       usually happens with a function that acts on a list of values, such as\n       Perl's built-in sort(). You can pass a comparison function to sort(),\n       which will then be invoked for every pair of values that needs to be\n       compared. The first() and reduce() functions from List::Util follow a\n       similar pattern.\n\n       In this case it is possible to speed up the routine (often quite\n       substantially) by using the lightweight callback API.
