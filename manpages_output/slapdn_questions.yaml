It opens the\n       slapd.conf(5) configuration file or the slapd-config (5) backend, reads\n       in the schema definitions, and then parses the DN list given on the\n       command-line.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -d_debug-level\n\t      enable debugging messages as defined by the specified\n\t      debug-level; see slapd(8) for details.\n\n       -f_slapd.conf\n\t      specify an alternative slapd.conf(5) file.\n\n       -F_confdir\n\t      specify a config directory.  If both -f and -F are specified,\n\t      the config file will be read and converted to config directory\n\t      format and written to the specified directory.  If neither\n\t      option is specified, an attempt to read the default config\n\t      directory will be made before trying to use the default config\n\t      file. If a valid config directory exists then the default config\n\t      file is ignored.\n\n       -N     only output a normalized form of the DN, suitable to be used in\n\t      a normalization tool; incompatible with -P.\n\n       -o_option[=value]\n\t      Specify an option with a(n optional) value.  Possible generic\n\t      options/values are:\n\n\t\t     syslog=<subsystems>  (see `-s' in slapd(8))\n\t\t     syslog-level=<level> (see `-S' in slapd(8))\n\t\t     syslog-user=<user>   (see `-l' in slapd(8))"
