Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `dot_clean`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDOT_CLEAN(1)\t\t    General Commands Manual\t\t  DOT_CLEAN(1)\n\nNAME\n     dot_clean â€“ Merge ._* files with corresponding native files.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     dot_clean [-fmnsv] [--keep=[mostrecent|dotbar|native]] [dir ...]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     For each dir, dot_clean recursively merges all ._* files with their\n     corresponding native files according to the rules specified with the\n     given arguments.  By default, if there is an attribute on the native file\n     that is also present in the ._ file, the most recent attribute will be\n     used.\n\n     If no operands are given, a usage message is output.  If more than one\n     directory is given, directories are merged in the order in which they are\n     specified.\n\nOPTIONS\n     -f      Flat merge.  Do not recursively merge all directories in the\n\t     given dir.  This is off by default.\n\n     -h      Help. Prints verbose usage message.\n\n     -m      Always delete dot underbar files.\n\n     -n      Delete dot underbar file if there is no matching native file."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the dot_clean command?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the dot_clean command to perform a flat merge without recursively processing directories?
  manpageQuestion3: What is the effect of using the -m flag with dot_clean, and how would you apply it to ensure all ._* files are deleted if they don't have a corresponding native file?

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use dot_clean to always prioritize the AppleDouble file's information when performing a merge?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using dot_clean with the --keep=mostrecent option to merge files on a mounted volume?
