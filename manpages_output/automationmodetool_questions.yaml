- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `automationmodetool`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nautomationmodetool(1)\t    General Commands Manual\t automationmodetool(1)\n\nNAME\n     automationmodetool â€“ Manage UI automation security preferences.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     automationmodetool enable-automationmode-without-authentication\n     automationmodetool disable-automationmode-without-authentication\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     automationmodetool can be used to configure a device such that Automation\n     Mode for UI testing can be enabled without user authentication.  This is\n     useful for configuring machines in continuous integration (CI)\n     environments as well as those in labs where the active users do not have\n     administrator privileges. Running the tool for this purpose requires an\n     administrator to authenticate in the shell.  If no argument is passed,\n     the tool prints the current status of Automation Mode (enabled or\n     disabled), the authentication configuration (required or not), and then\n     exits.\n\nDarwin\t\t\t\t18 March, 2021\t\t\t\tDarwin"
