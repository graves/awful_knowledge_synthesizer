    Manpage text:

    The target process may be specified by pid or by full or partial name, or
         it can be the path of a memory graph file generated by leaks or the Xcode
         Memory Graph Debugger.

         If the -highWaterMark option is passed, malloc_history first scans
         through the all malloc stack log records to calculate the "high water
         mark" of allocated memory -- i.e., the highest amount of allocated memory
         used at any one time by the target process.  It then shows information
         about the malloc allocations and anonymous VM regions that were live at
         that time, rather than currently alive in the target program.

         The -highWaterMark option requires full mode of MallocStackLogging, in
         either a live process or a memory graph file recorded with
         -fullStackHistory.

         By specifying one or more addresses, malloc_history lists all allocations
         and deallocations of any malloc blocks or VM regions that started at or
         contained those addresses.  For each allocation, a stack trace describing
         who called malloc or free, or mach_vm_allocate, mmap, or
         mach_vm_deallocate is listed.  If you do only wish to see events for
         malloc blocks and VM regions that started at the specified address, you
         can grep the output for that address.  If -highWaterMark is passed, it
         only shows allocations and deallocations up to the high water mark.

    Alternatively, the -allBySize and -allByCount options list all
         allocations that are currently live in the target process, or were live
         at the high water mark.  Frequent allocations from the same point in the
         program (that is, the same call stack) are grouped together, and output
         presented either from largest allocations to smallest, or most
         allocations to least.  If you also specify one or more addresses, this
         output is filtered to only show information for malloc blocks containing
         those addresses.

         The -allEvents option lists all allocation and free events, for all
         addresses, up to the current time or to the high water mark.  This output
         can be voluminous. If the -showContent option is passed, live allocations
         will have additional details as described for that option below.

         The -callTree option generates a call tree of the backtraces of malloc
         calls and anonymous VM regions for live allocations in the target
         process, or for allocations that were live at the high water mark.  The
         call tree can be filtered to backtraces of specific allocations or
         classes, by passing one or more addresses or a <classes-pattern>.

    Manpage text:

    malloc_history is particularly useful for tracking down memory smashers.
         Run the program to be inspected with MallocStackLogging or
         MallocStackLoggingNoCompact defined.  Also set the environment variable
         MallocScribble; this causes the malloc library to overwrite freed memory
         with a well-known value (0x55), and occasionally checks freed malloc
         blocks to make sure the memory has not been overwritten since it was
         cleared.  When malloc detects the memory has been written, it will print
         out a warning that the buffer was modified after being freed.  You can
         then use malloc_history to find who allocated and freed memory at that
         address, and thus deduce what parts of the code might still have a
         pointer to the freed structure.

    EXAMPLE
         To see backtraces of allocations by class type or malloc size, run this
         command:

         % malloc_history <process> -callTree -invert -showContent
