The package implements the registry\n       Tcl command.  This command is only supported on the Windows platform.\n       Warning: this command should be used with caution as a corrupted\n       registry can leave your system in an unusable state.\n\n       KeyName is the name of a registry key.  Registry keys must be one of\n       the following forms:\n\n\t      \\\\hostname\\rootname\\keypath\n\n\t      rootname\\keypath\n\n\t      rootname\n\n       Hostname specifies the name of any valid Windows host that exports its\n       registry.  The rootname component must be one of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE,\n       HKEY_USERS, HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG,\n       HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA, or HKEY_DYN_DATA.  The keypath can be one or\n       more registry key names separated by backslash (\\) characters."

The registry\n       command converts between this internal representation and one that can\n       be manipulated by Tcl scripts.  In most cases, the data is simply\n       returned as a Tcl string.  The type indicates the intended use for the\n       data, but does not actually change the representation.  For some types,\n       the registry command returns the data in a different form to make it\n       easier to manipulate.  The following types are recognized by the\n       registry command:"
