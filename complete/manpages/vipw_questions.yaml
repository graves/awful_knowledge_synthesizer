The default editor for vipw\n     is vi(1).\n\n     When run without options, vipw will work with the password files in /etc.\n     The -d option may be used to specify an alternative directory to work\n     with.\n\n     The vipw utility performs a number of consistency checks on the password\n     entries, and will not allow a password file with a “mangled” entry to be\n     installed.  If vipw rejects the new password file, the user is prompted\n     to re-enter the edit session.\n\n     Once the information has been verified, vipw uses pwd_mkdb(8) to update\n     the user database.  This is run in the background, and, at very large\n     sites could take several minutes.\tUntil this update is completed, the\n     password file is unavailable for other updates and the new information is\n     not available to programs."

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use vipw to edit the password file in a different directory than the default /etc?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using vipw to modify a user's password and ensure the changes are properly updated in the system?

This means that in a\n     default configuration where file system timestamps are not calculated\n     with sub-second precision, EDITOR has to run for at least one second.\n     Non-interactive editor scripts should invoke sleep(1) or equivalent to\n     ensure this happens.\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t       February 14, 2012\t\t    macOS 15.3"
