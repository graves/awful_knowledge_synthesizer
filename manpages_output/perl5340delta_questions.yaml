This\n       applies to all such constructs, namely \"\\b{}\", \"\\g{}\", \"\\k{}\", \"\\N{}\",\n       \"\\o{}\", and \"\\x{}\"; as well as the regular expression quantifier\n       \"{m,n}\".  \"\\p{}\" and \"\\P{}\" retain their already-existing, even looser,\n       rules mandated by the Unicode standard (see \"Properties accessible\n       through \\p{} and \\P{}\" in perluniprops)."

           Zealand and a self-described "huge geek," Kent was the author or
           maintainer of 178 CPAN distributions, the Perl maintainer for the
           Gentoo Linux distribution and a contributor to the Perl core
           distribution.  He is mourned by his family, friends and open source

    Acknowledgements
           Perl 5.34.0 represents approximately 11 months of development since
           Perl 5.32.0 and contains approximately 280,000 lines of changes across
           2,100 files from 78 authors.

           Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there
           were approximately 150,000 lines of changes to 1,300 .pm, .t, .c and .h
           files.

           Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant
