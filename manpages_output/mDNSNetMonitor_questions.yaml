Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `mDNSNetMonitor`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nmDNSNetMonitor(8)\t    System Manager's Manual\t     mDNSNetMonitor(8)\n\nNAME\n     mDNSNetMonitor â€“ dumps mDNS traffic on a network\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     mDNSNetMonitor [-i interface] [host]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     mDNSNetMonitor prints out a description of the contents of mDNS packets\n     on a network interface. It is similiar to tcpdump in that it continuously\n     captures packets until it is interrupted by a SIGINT signal (generated,\n     for example, by typing your interrupt character, typically  control-C)\n     or a SIGTERM signal (typically generated with the kill(1) command).\n\n     When mDNSNetMonitor finishes capturing packets, it will report counts of\n     packets captured per mDNS packet type, service type and source device.\n\n     Note that mDNSNetMonitor will not capture unicast mDNS packets.\n\nOPTION\n     -i interface    Displays packets on specified interface.\n\nExample\n     To print all packets arriving at or departing from sundown:\n\t % mDNSNetMonitor sundown\n\nSEE ALSO\n     mDNSResponder(8), dns-sd(8)"
