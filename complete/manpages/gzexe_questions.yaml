This saves disk\n     space, at the cost of slower execution times.  The original executables\n     are saved by copying each of them to a file with the same name with a ‘~’\n     suffix appended.  After verifying that the compressed executables work as\n     expected, the backup files can be removed.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -d      Decompress executables previously compressed by gzexe.\n\n     The gzexe program refuses to compress non-regular or non-executable\n     files, files with a setuid or setgid bit set, files that are already\n     compressed using gzexe or programs it needs to perform on-the-fly\n     decompression: sh(1), mktemp(1), rm(1), echo(1), tail(1), gzip(1), and\n     chmod(1)."
