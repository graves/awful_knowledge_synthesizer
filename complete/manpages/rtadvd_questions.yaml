It will then send\n     router advertisement packets periodically, as well as in response to\n     router solicitation messages sent by end hosts.\n\n     Router advertisements can be configured on a per-interface basis, as\n     described in rtadvd.conf(5).\n\n     If there is no configuration file entry for an interface, or if the\n     configuration file does not exist altogether, rtadvd sets all the\n     parameters to their default values.  In particular, rtadvd reads all the\n     interface routes from the routing table and advertises them as on-link\n     prefixes.\n\n     rtadvd also watches the routing table.  If an interface direct route is\n     added on an advertising interface and no static prefixes are specified by\n     the configuration file, rtadvd adds the corresponding prefix to its\n     advertising list."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `rtadvd`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nSimilarly, when an interface direct route is deleted, rtadvd will start\n     advertising the prefixes with zero valid and preferred lifetimes to help\n     the receiving hosts switch to a new prefix when renumbering.  Note,\n     however, that the zero valid lifetime cannot invalidate the\n     autoconfigured addresses at a receiving host immediately.\tAccording to\n     the specification, the host will retain the address for a certain period,\n     which will typically be two hours.  The zero lifetimes rather intend to\n     make the address deprecated, indicating that a new non-deprecated address\n     should be used as the source address of a new connection.\tThis behavior\n     will last for two hours.  Then rtadvd will completely remove the prefix\n     from the advertising list, and succeeding advertisements will not contain\n     the prefix information.\n\n     Moreover, if the status of an advertising interface changes, rtadvd will\n     start or stop sending router advertisements according to the latest\n     status."

However, it would sometimes be useful to\n     allow hosts to advertise some parameters such as prefix information and\n     link MTU.\tThus, rtadvd can be invoked if router lifetime is explicitly\n     set zero on every advertising interface.\n\n     The command line options are:\n\n     -c      Specify an alternate location, configfile, for the configuration\n\t     file.  By default, /etc/rtadvd.conf is used.\n\n     -d      Print debugging information.\n\n     -D      Even more debugging information is printed.\n\n     -f      This option is now deprecated and ignored.\n\n     -F      Specify an alternative file in which to dump internal states when\n\t     rtadvd receives signal SIGUSR1.
