Names that do not conform to the Windows\n\t naming convention.\n\n       — Names with Unicode Private User Area (PUA) code points.  Illegal\n\t Windows names that are created by Mac and Linux SMB clients.\n\n       — Names with invalid UTF-8 values.  Names created by StorNext Linux and\n\t Mac clients using invalid UTF-8 hex sequences.\n\n       If snfsnamescanner finds a name with one of the specified problems, it\n       creates a script which can be used to change the name of the file.\n\n       pathname is the path to the root directory of a mount Xsan file system.\n\n       Snfsnamescanner can only be run on a Linux system.  You may need to\n       become user root to access all the files and directories in the file\n       system.\tRun snfsnamescanner on the active MDC for the fastest scan\n       times.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -i     Scan the specified file system for illegal Windows file names.\n\t      The file names with illegal file names are placed in the file\n\t      illegalFileNames.sh.  This file can be used for changing the\n\t      file name to a legal Windows file name.\n\n       -p     Scan the specified file system for file names with PUA code\n\t      points in the name.  The file names with PUA code points are put\n\t      in the file puaFileNames.sh.  This file can be used for changing\n\t      the file name to an equivalent name with ASCII characters.\n\n       -u     Scan the specified file system for file names with invalid UTF-8\n\t      values in the name.  The file names with invalid UTF-8 values\n\t      are put in the file utf8FileNames.sh.\n\n       -L 1   Convert Latin-1 characters to UTF-8.  Use in conjunction with\n\t      the -u option.  Treat any invalid UTF-8 byte sequence as a\n\t      Latin-1 character.  Translate each Latin-1 character to a valid\n\t      UTF-8 sequence.  Use this option only if you are sure the\n\t      character encoding is Latin-1.\n\n       -h     Display help\n\n       You can specify one or more of the -i, -p or -u options at the same\n       time.  Specifying more than one option is more efficient than running\n       snfsnamescanner multiple times.\n\nExamples:\n       To scan for illegal Windows file names:\n\n\t  snfsnamescanner -i /stornext/snfs1\n\n       The list of illegal file names is written to ./illegalFileNames.sh.\n       Each line in illlegalFileNames.sh will have identical source and target\n       file names.  You will have to decide on how to change the target file\n       name to a legal Windows file name.\n\n       To scan for PUA code points in file system names:\n\n\t  snfsnamescanner -p /stornext/snfs1\n\n       The list of file names with PUA code points is written to\n       ./puaFileNames.sh.  This script can be used without modification.  Run\n       this script on the same system it was created since it uses the mount\n       point to the file system.  This script will replace each PUA code point\n       in a file or directory name with the equivalent PUA code point ASCII\n       character.\n\n       To scan for file names with invalid UTF-8 values:\n\n\t  snfsnamescanner -u /stornext/snfs1\n\n       The list of file names with invalid UTF-8 values is written to\n       ./utf8FileNames.sh.  If the -L option is not used, each line in\n       utf8FileNames.sh will have identical source and target file names.  You\n       will have to decide on how to change the invalid UTF-8 values to valid\n       UTF-8 values.\n\n       The target names in the illlegalFileNames.sh file, and possibly the\n       utf8FileNames.sh file, will need to be changed before running the\n       script.\tThere are many ways to do this.  Here is an example on how to\n       use the Linux sed(1) command to change the target file names in the\n       illlegalFileNames.sh file.\n\n       To change the target file names in the ./illegalFileNames.sh file, run\n       the following command.\n\n\t      sed -i -f sedscript ./illegalFileNames.sh\n\n       Where the contents of the sedscript should looks something like this:\n\n\t      s-\\(\\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\\)<-\\1#-\n\t      s-\\(\\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\\)>-\\1@-\n\t      s-\\(\\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\\):-\\1!-\n\t      s-\\(\\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\\)\"-\\1%-\n\t      s-\\(\\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\\)|-\\1+-\n\t      s-\\(\\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\\)?-\\1~-\n\t      s-\\(\\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\\)\\*-\\1A-\n\t      s-\\(\\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\\) '$-\\1_'-\n\t      s-\\(\\t'/stornext/snfs1/.*\\)\\.'$-\\1p'-\n\n       Change the string \"/stornext/snfs1\" to match the mount point in the\n       ./illegalFileNames.sh file.  The substitution characters are just an\n       example.  You can change the sed substitution characters to any set of\n       characters you like, although it would be best if each substitution is\n       unique.\tYou may need to run this sed script multiple times.  Each pass\n       will only change a single occurance of the character on a line.\tYou\n       may want to grep the ./illegalFileNames.sh file to see which Windows\n       reserved characters are present in the file and modify the sed script\n       accordingly.\n\nFILES\n       /usr/cvfs/lib/snfsnamescanner\n       ./illegalFileNames.sh\n       ./puaFileNames.sh\n       ./utf8FileNames.sh\n\nSEE ALSO\n       For more information about illegal Windows file name and Unicode\n       Private User Area code points, see the \"StorNext File Name\n       Considerations\" section in the StorNext User's Guide."
