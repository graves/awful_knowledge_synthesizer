Each\n       message is piped through the cleanup(8) daemon, and is placed into the\n       incoming queue as one single queue file.  The program expects to be run\n       from the master(8) process manager.\n\n       The QMQP server implements one access policy: only explicitly\n       authorized client hosts are allowed to use the service.\n\nSECURITY\n       The QMQP server is moderately security-sensitive. It talks to QMQP\n       clients and to DNS servers on the network. The QMQP server can be run\n       chrooted at fixed low privilege.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       Problems and transactions are logged to syslogd(8).\n\nBUGS\n       The QMQP protocol provides only one server reply per message delivery.\n       It is therefore not possible to reject individual recipients.\n\n       The QMQP protocol requires the server to receive the entire message\n       before replying. If a message is malformed, or if any netstring\n       component is longer than acceptable, Postfix replies immediately and\n       closes the connection. It is left up to the client to handle the\n       situation.\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n       Changes to main.cf are picked up automatically, as qmqpd(8) processes\n       run for only a limited amount of time. Use the command \"postfix reload\"\n       to speed up a change.\n\n       The text below provides only a parameter summary. See postconf(5) for\n       more details including examples.\n\nCONTENT INSPECTION CONTROLS\n\n       content_filter (empty)\n\t      After the message is queued, send the entire message to the\n\t      specified transport:destination.\n\n       receive_override_options (empty)\n\t      Enable or disable recipient validation, built-in content\n\t      filtering, or address mapping.\n\nSMTPUTF8 CONTROLS\n       Preliminary SMTPUTF8 support is introduced with Postfix 3.0.\n\n       smtputf8_enable (yes)\n\t      Enable preliminary SMTPUTF8 support for the protocols described\n\t      in RFC 6531..6533.\n\n       smtputf8_autodetect_classes (sendmail, verify)\n\t      Detect that a message requires SMTPUTF8 support for the\n\t      specified mail origin classes.\n\n       Available in Postfix version 3.2 and later:\n\n       enable_idna2003_compatibility (no)\n\t      Enable 'transitional' compatibility between IDNA2003 and\n\t      IDNA2008, when converting UTF-8 domain names to/from the ASCII\n\t      form that is used for DNS lookups.\n\nRESOURCE AND RATE CONTROLS\n\n       line_length_limit (2048)\n\t      Upon input, long lines are chopped up into pieces of at most\n\t      this length; upon delivery, long lines are reconstructed.\n\n       hopcount_limit (50)\n\t      The maximal number of Received:  message headers that is allowed\n\t      in the primary message headers.\n\n       message_size_limit (10240000)\n\t      The maximal size in bytes of a message, including envelope\n\t      information.\n\n       qmqpd_timeout (300s)\n\t      The time limit for sending or receiving information over the\n\t      network.\n\nTROUBLE SHOOTING CONTROLS\n\n       debug_peer_level (2)\n\t      The increment in verbose logging level when a remote client or\n\t      server matches a pattern in the debug_peer_list parameter.\n\n       debug_peer_list (empty)\n\t      Optional list of remote client or server hostname or network\n\t      address patterns that cause the verbose logging level to\n\t      increase by the amount specified in $debug_peer_level.\n\n       soft_bounce (no)\n\t      Safety net to keep mail queued that would otherwise be returned\n\t      to the sender.\n\nTARPIT CONTROLS\n\n       qmqpd_error_delay (1s)\n\t      How long the Postfix QMQP server will pause before sending a\n\t      negative reply to the remote QMQP client.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS CONTROLS\n\n       config_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      The default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf\n\t      configuration files.\n\n       daemon_timeout (18000s)\n\t      How much time a Postfix daemon process may take to handle a\n\t      request before it is terminated by a built-in watchdog timer.\n\n       ipc_timeout (3600s)\n\t      The time limit for sending or receiving information over an\n\t      internal communication channel.\n\n       max_idle (100s)\n\t      The maximum amount of time that an idle Postfix daemon process\n\t      waits for an incoming connection before terminating voluntarily.\n\n       max_use (100)\n\t      The maximal number of incoming connections that a Postfix daemon\n\t      process will service before terminating voluntarily.\n\n       process_id (read-only)\n\t      The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.\n\n       process_name (read-only)\n\t      The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.\n\n       qmqpd_authorized_clients (empty)\n\t      What remote QMQP clients are allowed to connect to the Postfix\n\t      QMQP server port.\n\n       queue_directory (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      The location of the Postfix top-level queue directory.\n\n       syslog_facility (mail)\n\t      The syslog facility of Postfix logging.\n\n       syslog_name (see 'postconf -d' output)\n\t      A prefix that is prepended to the process name in syslog\n\t      records, so that, for example, \"smtpd\" becomes \"prefix/smtpd\".\n\n       verp_delimiter_filter (-=+)\n\t      The characters Postfix accepts as VERP delimiter characters on\n\t      the Postfix sendmail(1) command line and in SMTP commands.\n\n       Available in Postfix version 2.5 and later:\n\n       qmqpd_client_port_logging (no)\n\t      Enable logging of the remote QMQP client port in addition to the\n\t      hostname and IP address.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       http://cr.yp.to/proto/qmqp.html, QMQP protocol\n       cleanup(8), message canonicalization\n       master(8), process manager\n       syslogd(8), system logging\n\nREADME FILES\n       Use \"postconf readme_directory\" or \"postconf html_directory\" to locate\n       this information.\n       QMQP_README, Postfix ezmlm-idx howto.\n\nLICENSE\n       The Secure Mailer license must be distributed with this software.\n\nHISTORY\n       The qmqpd service was introduced with Postfix version 1.1.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n       Wietse Venema\n       IBM T.J.
