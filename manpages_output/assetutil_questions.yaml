When thinning scale, idiom, subtype, performance, memory, and\n     graphicsclassfallbacks can be given multiple times, the resulting file\n     will contain all of the assets that match all of the parameters given. If\n     scale, idiom, subtype and graphics class are given in one set, the same\n     parameters must all be present in the subsequent set of parmeters. (IE\n     the count must match)\n\n     A list of flags and their descriptions:\n\n     -V       version information for assetutil\n\n     -I       Produce a JSON description of the asset catalog object with the\n\t      given name to --output directory if given or to stdout if no\n\t      output path given.
