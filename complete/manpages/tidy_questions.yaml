For\n       HTML varians, it detects and corrects many common coding errors and\n       strives to produce visually equivalent markup that is both W3C\n       complaint and works on most browsers.  A common use of Tidy is to\n       convert plain HTML to XHTML.  For generic XML files, Tidy is limited to\n       correcting basic well-formedness errors and pretty printing.\n\n       If no markup file is specified, Tidy reads the standard input.  If no\n       output file is specified, Tidy writes markup to the standard output.\n       If no error file is specified, Tidy writes messages to the standard\n       error.\n\nOPTIONS\n       Processing directives\n\n       -indent or -i  to indent element content\n\n       -omit\t      to omit optional end tags\n\n       -wrap <column> to wrap text at the specified <column> (default is 68)\n\n       -upper or -u   to force tags to upper case (default is lower case)\n\n       -clean or -c   to replace FONT, NOBR and CENTER tags by CSS\n\n       -bare or -b    to strip out smart quotes and em dashes, etc.\n\n       -numeric or -n to output numeric rather than named entities\n\n       -errors or -e  to only show errors\n\n       -quiet or -q   to suppress nonessential output\n\n       -xml\t      to specify the input is well formed XML\n\n       -asxml\t      to convert HTML to well formed XHTML\n\n       -asxhtml       to convert HTML to well formed XHTML\n\n       -ashtml\t      to force XHTML to well formed HTML\n\n       -access <level>\n\t\t      to do additional accessibility checks (<level> = 1, 2,\n\t\t      3)\n\n       Character encodings\n\n       -raw\t      to output values above 127 without conversion to\n\t\t      entities\n\n       -ascii\t      to use US-ASCII for output, ISO-8859-1 for input\n\n       -latin1\t      to use ISO-8859-1 for both input and output\n\n       -iso2022       to use ISO-2022 for both input and output\n\n       -utf8\t      to use UTF-8 for both input and output\n\n       -mac\t      to use MacRoman for input, US-ASCII for output\n\n       -utf16le       to use UTF-16LE for both input and output\n\n       -utf16be       to use UTF-16BE for both input and output\n\n       -utf16\t      to use UTF-16 for both input and output\n\n       -win1252       to use Windows-1252 for input, US-ASCII for output\n\n       -big5\t      to use Big5 for both input and output\n\n       -shiftjis      to use Shift_JIS for both input and output\n\n       -language <lang>\n\t\t      to set the two-letter language code <lang> (for future\n\t\t      use)\n\n       File manipulation\n\n       -output or -o <file>\n\t\t      to write output to the specified <file>\n\n       -f <file>      to write errors to the specified <file>\n\n       -config <file> to set configuration options from the specified <file>\n\n       -modify or -m  to modify the original input files\n\n       Miscellaneous\n\n       -version or -v to show the version of Tidy\n\n       -help, -h or -?\n\t\t      to list the command line options\n\n       -help-config   to list all configuration options\n\n       -show-config   to list the current configuration settings\n\nUSAGE\n       Use --blah blarg for any configuration option \"blah\" with argument\n       \"blarg\"\n\n       Input/Output default to stdin/stdout respectively Single letter options\n       apart from -f and -o may be combined as in:  tidy -f errs.txt -imu\n       foo.html For further info on HTML see http://www.w3.org/MarkUp\n\n       For more information about HTML Tidy, visit the project home page at\n       http://tidy.sourceforge.net.

This should be\n\t\t      an absolute path, since you will probably invoke tidy\n\t\t      from different directories.  The value of HTML_TIDY will\n\t\t      be parsed after the compiled-in default (defined with\n\t\t      -DCONFIG_FILE), but before any of the files specified\n\t\t      using -config.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n       0      All input files were processed successfully.\n\n       1      There were warnings.\n\n       2      There were errors.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       HTML Tidy Project Page at http://tidy.sourceforge.net\n\n       Dave Raggett's Tidy Overview at http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/\n\n       Tidy Quick Reference at http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html\n\n       For information about TidyLib, see\n       http://tidy.sourceforge.net/libintro.html\n\nAUTHORS\n       Dave Raggett <dsr@w3.org>.\n\n       Terry Teague <terry_teague@users.sourceforge.net>.\n\n       Bjoern Hoehrmann <bjoern@hoehrmann.de>\n\n       Charles Reitzel <creitzel@rcn.com>\n\n       This manual page was written by Matej Vela <vela@debian.org> and\n       updated by Charles Reitzel."
