Documentation in this part of section 4 is\n     broken up into three areas: protocol families (domains), protocols, and\n     network interfaces.\n\n     All network protocols are associated with a specific protocol family.  A\n     protocol family provides basic services to the protocol implementation to\n     allow it to function within a specific network environment.  These\n     services may include packet fragmentation and reassembly, routing,\n     addressing, and basic transport.  A protocol family may support multiple\n     methods of addressing, though the current protocol implementations do\n     not.  A protocol family is normally comprised of a number of protocols,\n     one per socket(2) type.  It is not required that a protocol family\n     support all socket types.\tA protocol family may contain multiple\n     protocols supporting the same socket abstraction."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `networking`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nA protocol supports one of the socket abstractions detailed in socket(2).\n     A specific protocol may be accessed either by creating a socket of the\n     appropriate type and protocol family, or by requesting the protocol\n     explicitly when creating a socket.  Protocols normally accept only one\n     type of address format, usually determined by the addressing structure\n     inherent in the design of the protocol family/network architecture.\n     Certain semantics of the basic socket abstractions are protocol specific.\n     All protocols are expected to support the basic model for their\n     particular socket type, but may, in addition, provide non-standard\n     facilities or extensions to a mechanism.  For example, a protocol\n     supporting the SOCK_STREAM abstraction may allow more than one byte of\n     out-of-band data to be transmitted per out-of-band message.\n\n     A network interface is similar to a device interface.  Network interfaces\n     comprise the lowest layer of the networking subsystem, interacting with\n     the actual transport hardware.  An interface may support one or more\n     protocol families and/or address formats.\tThe SYNOPSIS section of each\n     network interface entry gives a sample specification of the related\n     drivers for use in providing a system description to the config(8)\n     program.  The DIAGNOSTICS section lists messages which may appear on the\n     console and/or in the system error log, /var/log/messages (see\n     syslogd(8)), due to errors in device operation."

All network\n     address adhere to a general structure, called a sockaddr, described\n     below. However, each protocol imposes finer and more specific structure,\n     generally renaming the variant, which is discussed in the protocol family\n     manual page alluded to above.\n\n\t       struct sockaddr {\n\t\t   u_char  sa_len;\n\t\t   u_char  sa_family;\n\t\t   char    sa_data[14];\n\t   };\n\n     The field sa_len contains the total length of the structure, which may\n     exceed 16 bytes.
