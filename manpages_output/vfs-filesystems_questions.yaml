The whole set of these virtual\n       filesystems is known informally as Â´vfslib'.\n\nSUPPORTED VFS TYPES\n       Currently supported are ftp, tar, http, zip, mk4, ns, and webdav.  In\n       addition there is the ability to mount any 'urltype' as a new\n       directory, provided an appropriate vfs is supported.  This means that\n       you can treat urls based on the schemes ftp://, http:// and file:// as\n       files.  To do this, simply evaluate the command vfs::urltype::Mount ftp\n       for example.  Any access inside the new volume will result in an\n       attempt to require a package through package require vfs::${type},\n       which must therefore exist, or errors will be thrown.  If a filesystem\n       is loaded, use the associated command listed below to mount a source\n       for that filesystem as a tcl directory.\n\n       vfs::zip::Mount path to\n\t      Mount the zip file path as directory to.\n\n       vfs::mk4::Mount path to\n\t      Mount the metakit database file file path as directory to.\n\n       vfs::tar::Mount path to\n\t      Mount the tar file path as directory to.\n\n       vfs::ftp::Mount path to\n\t      Mount the ftp url path as directory to.\n\n       vfs::ns::Mount path to\n\t      Mount the tcl namespace path as directory to.\n\n       vfs::webdav::Mount path to\n\t      Mount the webdav url path as directory to.\n\n       vfs::http::Mount path to\n\t      Mount the http url path as directory to.\n\n       vfs::urltype::Mount path to\n\t      Mount the url path, of type urltype as directory to.\n\nLIMITATIONS\n       Most of the vfs types listed above have not been very well debugged as\n       yet.
