    ### Fetch from multiple urls

    Suppose you are querying several endpoints,
    perhaps with different query parameters and you want to view all the responses as a single dataset.

    An example JSON file, `urls.json`, with the following contents:

    ```json
    {
      "urls": [
        "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1",
        "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2",
        "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3"
      ]
    }
    ```

    ```nu
    open urls.json | get urls | each { |u| http get $u }
    # => ━━━┯━━━━━━━━┯━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    # =>  # │ userId │ id │ title                                                   │ body
    # => ───┼────────┼────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # =>  0 │      1 │  1 │ sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi  │ quia et suscipit
    # =>    │        │    │ optio reprehenderit                                     │ suscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum
    # =>    │        │    │                                                         │ reprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam
    # =>    │        │    │                                                         │ nostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto
    # =>  1 │      1 │  2 │ qui est esse                                            │ est rerum tempore vitae
    # =>    │        │    │                                                         │ sequi sint nihil reprehenderit dolor beatae ea dolores
    # =>    │        │    │                                                         │ neque
    # =>    │        │    │                                                         │ fugiat blanditiis voluptate porro vel nihil molestiae ut
    # =>    │        │    │                                                         │ reiciendis
    # =>    │        │    │                                                         │ qui aperiam non debitis possimus qui neque nisi nulla
    # =>  2 │      1 │  3 │ ea molestias quasi exercitationem repellat qui ipsa sit │ et iusto sed quo iure
    # =>    │        │    │ aut                                                     │ voluptatem occaecati omnis eligendi aut ad
    # =>    │        │    │                                                         │ voluptatem doloribus vel accusantium quis pariatur
    # =>    │        │    │                                                         │ molestiae porro eius odio et labore et velit aut
    # => ━━━┷━━━━━━━━┷━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    ```

    ---

    If you specify the `--raw` flag, you'll see 3 separate json objects, one in each row.

    ```nu
    open urls.json | get urls | each { |u| http get $u -r }
    # => ━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    # =>  # │ <value>
    # => ───┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # =>  0 │ {
    # =>    │   "userId": 1,
    # =>    │   "id": 1,
    # =>    │   "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit",
    # =>    │   "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum
    # =>    │ rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto"
    # =>    │ }
    # =>  1 │ {
    # =>    │   "userId": 1,
    # =>    │   "id": 2,
    # =>    │   "title": "qui est esse",
    # =>    │   "body": "est rerum tempore vitae\nsequi sint nihil reprehenderit dolor beatae ea dolores neque\nfugiat blanditiis voluptate porro
    # =>    │ vel nihil molestiae ut reiciendis\nqui aperiam non debitis possimus qui neque nisi nulla"
    # =>    │ }
    # =>  2 │ {
    # =>    │   "userId": 1,
    # =>    │   "id": 3,
    # =>    │   "title": "ea molestias quasi exercitationem repellat qui ipsa sit aut",
    # =>    │   "body": "et iusto sed quo iure\nvoluptatem occaecati omnis eligendi aut ad\nvoluptatem doloribus vel accusantium quis
    # =>    │ pariatur\nmolestiae porro eius odio et labore et velit aut"
    # =>    │ }
    # => ━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    ```

    ---

    To combine these responses together into a valid JSON array, you can turn the table into json.

    ```nu
    open urls.json | get urls | each { |u| http get $u } | to json
    ```

    Output

    ```json
    [
      {
        "userId": 1,
        "id": 1,
        "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit",
        "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto"
      },
      {
        "userId": 1,
        "id": 2,
        "title": "qui est esse",
        "body": "est rerum tempore vitae\nsequi sint nihil reprehenderit dolor beatae ea dolores neque\nfugiat blanditiis voluptate porro vel nihil molestiae ut reiciendis\nqui aperiam non debitis possimus qui neque nisi nulla"
      },
      {
        "userId": 1,
        "id": 3,
        "title": "ea molestias quasi exercitationem repellat qui ipsa sit aut",
        "body": "et iusto sed quo iure\nvoluptatem occaecati omnis eligendi aut ad\nvoluptatem doloribus vel accusantium quis pariatur\nmolestiae porro eius odio et labore et velit aut"
      }
    ]
    ```

    Making a `post` request to an endpoint with a JSON payload. To make long requests easier, you can organize your json payloads inside a file.

    ```json
    {
      "my_payload": {
        "title": "foo",
        "body": "bar",
        "userId": 1
      }
    }
    ```

    ```nu
    open payload.json | get my_payload | to json | http post https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts $in
    # => ━━━━━
    # =>  id
    # => ─────
    # =>  101
    # => ━━━━━
    ```

    ---

    We can put this all together into a pipeline where we read data, manipulate it, and then send it back to the API. Lets `fetch` a post, `increment` the id, and `post` it back to the endpoint. In this particular example, the test endpoint gives back an arbitrary response which we can't actually mutate.

    ```nu
    open urls.json | get urls | first | http get $in | upsert id {|item| $item.id | inc} | to json | http post https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts $in
    # => ━━━━━
    # =>  id
    # => ─────
    # =>  101
    # => ━━━━━
    ```

    ### Uploading files

    To upload a form with a file (think a common file upload form in a browser, where you have to select a file and provide some additional data), you need to:

    1. Specify the content type as `multipart/form-data`
    2. Provide the record as the POST body
    3. Provide the file data in one of the record fields as *binary* data.

    ```nu
    http post https://httpbin.org/post --content-type "multipart/form-data" {
      icon: (open -r ~/Downloads/favicon-32x32.png),
      description: "Small icon"

    If the file happens to be a text file, you may need to additionally convert it to binary data before sending it. This can be done using the `into binary` command.

    ```nu
    http post https://httpbin.org/post --content-type "multipart/form-data" {
      doc: (open -r ~/Downloads/README.txt | into binary),
      description: "Documentation file"
    }

    title: ssh-agent
    ---

    # Manage SSH passphrases

    `eval` is not available in nushell, so run:

    ```nu
    ^ssh-agent -c
        | lines
        | first 2
        | parse "setenv {name} {value};"
        | transpose -r
        | into record
        | load-env
    ```

    ::: warning
    Adding this to your `env.nu` will however start a new ssh-agent process every time you start a new terminal.
    See the workarounds.
    :::

    Alternatively, use the third-party Nu plugin [bash-env](https://github.com/tesujimath/nu_plugin_bash_env) as follows.

    ```nu
    ^ssh-agent | bash-env | load-env
    ```

    ::: warning
    Please note that the `bash-env` plugin is not supported by the core Nushell team.
    All issues and requests for support should be directed to its own
    [issue tracker](https://github.com/tesujimath/nu_plugin_bash_env/issues).
    :::

    ## Workarounds

    You can work around this behavior by checking if a ssh-agent is already running on your user, and start one if none is:

    ```nu
    do --env {
        let ssh_agent_file = (
            $nu.temp-path | path join $"ssh-agent-($env.USER? | default $env.USERNAME).nuon"
        )

        if ($ssh_agent_file | path exists) {
            let ssh_agent_env = open ($ssh_agent_file)
            if ($"/proc/($ssh_agent_env.SSH_AGENT_PID)" | path exists) {
                load-env $ssh_agent_env
                return
            } else {
                rm $ssh_agent_file
            }
        }

        let ssh_agent_env = ^ssh-agent -c
            | lines
            | first 2
            | parse "setenv {name} {value};"
            | transpose --header-row
            | into record
        load-env $ssh_agent_env
        $ssh_agent_env | save --force $ssh_agent_file
    }
    ```

    ### [Keychain](https://www.funtoo.org/Funtoo:Keychain)

    ```nu
    keychain --eval --quiet <your ssh keys, eg. id_ed25519>
        | lines
        | where not ($it | is-empty)
        | parse "{k}={v}; export {k2};"
        | select k v
        | transpose --header-row
        | into record
        | load-env
    ```

    ## Non-nushell workarounds

    However, the commonly recommended approach involves running an ssh-agent so it establishes an user-wide socket for processes to connect to.

    Here are two common ways to achieve this.

    ### DE/WM config

    You can incorporate it into your Desktop Environment (DE) or Compositor's configuration using the following command:

    ```sh
    ssh-agent -D -a /run/user/1000/ssh-agent.socket
    # You can also set this socket path as an environment variable using the same config file
    ```

    This a good option for you if you're using a Windows Manager or a Compositor since you're likely to know its syntax.

    ### As a service

    Alternatively, you can enable it as an **user service**. OpenSSH typically includes a systemd service and the [ArchLinux wiki systemd/User](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd/User) page covers how to enable services per user with systemd.

    However, if you're using a different service manager, please refer its own documentation to create a user service that utilizes the aforementioned command.

    To enable Nushell to access this socket, you need to add its path as `$env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK` like so:

    ```nu
    $env.SSH_AUTH_SOCK = $"($env.XDG_RUNTIME_DIR)/ssh-agent.socket"
    ```

    # Advanced table workflows

    ### Merging tables of different size

    Examples shown in [`Working with tables`](../book/working_with_tables.md) work fine when our tables have equal amount of rows but what if we want to merge tables of different sizes?

    ```nu
    let first_table = [[a b]; [1 2] [3 4]]
    let second_table = [[c d]; [5 6]]
    $first_table | merge $second_table
    # => ───┬───┬───┬───┬───
    # =>  # │ a │ b │ c │ d
    # => ───┼───┼───┼───┼───
    # =>  0 │ 1 │ 2 │ 5 │ 6
    # => ───┼───┼───┼───┼───
    # =>  1 │ 3 │ 4 │ ❎│ ❎
    # => ───┴───┴───┴───┴───
    ```

    Columns `c` and `d` in the second row are empty because our `second` table only contained a single row; Nushell has nothing to fill the remaining rows with. But what if we wanted the smaller table to 'wrap around' and keep filling the rows? For that we can use the [`chunks`](/commands/docs/chunks.md) command to split the larger table into subtables, merge each of them with the smaller table and then combine the merged tables together using [`flatten`](/commands/docs/flatten.md) command

    For example:

    ```nu
    let first_table = [[a b]; [1 2] [3 4]]
    let second_table = [[c d]; [5 6]]

    $first_table
    | chunks ($second_table | length)
    | each { merge $second_table }
    | flatten
    # => ───┬───┬───┬───┬───
    # =>  # │ a │ b │ c │ d
    # => ───┼───┼───┼───┼───
    # =>  0 │ 1 │ 2 │ 5 │ 6
    # => ───┼───┼───┼───┼───
    # =>  1 │ 3 │ 4 │ 5 │ 6
    # => ───┴───┴───┴───┴───
    ```

    Can we do that with more than two tables? Sure we can! Let's add a third table:

    ```nu
    let third_table = [[e f]; [7 8]]
    ```

    We can merge all three tables like this:

    ```nu
    $first_table
    | chunks ($second_table | length)
    | each { merge $second_table }
    | flatten
    | chunks ($third_table | length)
    | each { merge $third_table }
    | flatten
    # => ───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───
    # =>  # │ a │ b │ c │ d │ e │ f
    # => ───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───
    # =>  0 │ 1 │ 2 │ 5 │ 6 │ 7 │ 8
    # => ───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───
    # =>  1 │ 3 │ 4 │ 5 │ 6 │ 7 │ 8
    # => ───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───
    ```

    Or as mentioned in the [Cookbook](https://www.nushell.sh/book/working_with_tables.html#merging-tables) we can use the [`reduce`](../commands/docs/reduce.md) command to merge tables together recursively:

    ```nu
    [$first_table $second_table $third_table]
    | reduce { |elt, acc|
        $acc
        | chunks ($elt | length)
        | each { merge $elt }
        | flatten
      }
    # => ───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───
    # =>  # │ a │ b │ c │ d │ e │ f
    # => ───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───
    # =>  0 │ 1 │ 2 │ 5 │ 6 │ 7 │ 8
    # => ───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───
    # =>  1 │ 3 │ 4 │ 5 │ 6 │ 7 │ 8
    # => ───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───
    ```

    title: Acting on keypresses using `input listen`
    ---

    # Acting on keypresses using `input listen`

    A common "key listening" pattern is to:

    - Listen for a specific key (or one of a set of keys) to be pressed
    - Take action depending on which key was pressed
    - Loop if one of the expected keys wasn't pressed

    There are several patterns that can accomplish this, each with advantages and disadvantages. You can choose from one of the following patterns that best fits your use-case and coding style:

    1.  A first attempt might be the following simple loop. This will work for some cases, but a `loop` cannot itself return a _value_:

        ```nu
        def run_some_code [] {
          print "I'm running the code, but I can't return a"
          print "value because I need to `break` out of the loop."
          42
          break
        }

        print '(a) Run some code (x) Exit'

        loop {
          let key = (input listen --types [key])
          if ($key.code == 'a') and ($key.modifiers == []) {
              run_some_code
          } else if ($key.code == 'x') and ($key.modifiers == []) {
              print 'User exited'
              break
          } else if ($key.code == 'c') and ($key.modifiers == ['keymodifiers(control)']) {
              print 'Terminated with Ctrl-C'
              break
          } else {
              print "That key wasn't recognized."
              print 'Press (a) to run some code or (x) to Exit'
              continue
          }
        }
        ```

    2.  If you need to return a value, you can use a mutable variable to hold the key result after the input loop has ended, _then_ return a value based on the captured keypress:

        ```nu
        def run_some_code [] {
          print "I'm running the code and returning 42"
          42
        }

        mut key_props = []
        print '(a) Run some code (x) Exit'

        loop {
          let key = (input listen --types [key])
          $key_props = [$key.code $key.modifiers]
          let valid_keys = [
            [ 'a' [] ]
            [ 'x' [] ]
            [ 'c' ['keymodifiers(control)'] ]
          ]

          if $key_props in $valid_keys {
              break
          } else {
              print "That key wasn't recognized."
              print 'Press (a) to run some code or (x) to Exit'
              continue
          }
        }

        # Act on the captured keypress from the mutable variable
        if $key_props == [ 'a' [] ] {
            run_some_code
        } else if $key_props == [ 'x' [] ] {
            print 'User exited'
        } else if $key_props == [ 'c' ['keymodifiers(control)'] ] {
            print 'Terminated with Ctrl-C'
        }
        ```

    3.  This version uses a custom command that recursively calls itself until one of the desired keys is pressed. However, keep in mind that Nushell limits the number of recursive calls based on the value of `$env.config.recursion_limit` (default 50). Hold down the <kbd>y</kbd> key (not monitored) to demonstrate an early exit based on recursion limits.

        Note that `break` statements are not needed in this version.

        ```nu
        def run_some_code [] {
          print "I'm running the code and returning 42"
          42
        }

        print '(a) Run some code (x) Exit'

        def input_loop [] {
          let key = (input listen --types [key])
          if ($key.code == 'a') and ($key.modifiers == []) {
              run_some_code
          } else if ($key.code == 'x') and ($key.modifiers == []) {
              print 'User exited'
          } else if ($key.code == 'c') and ($key.modifiers == ['keymodifiers(control)']) {
              print 'Terminated with Ctrl-C'
          } else {
              print "That key wasn't recognized."
              print 'Press (a) to run some code or (x) to Exit'
              # Recurse
              input_loop
          }
        }
        # Start the loop
        try {
          input_loop
        } catch {|e| print ($e.debug)}
        ```

    4.  The `generate` command offers a functional loop alternative, without recursion limits or mutable variables. `generate` can also collect multiple results into a list, and the output is streamed.

        ```nu
        def run_some_code [] {
          print "I'm running the code and returning 42"
          42
        }

        print '(a) Run some code (x) Exit'

        let key_generator = {|_|
          let key = (input listen --types [key])

          if ($key.code == 'a') and ($key.modifiers == []) {
              # Returning an "out" record without a "next" terminates the loop
              { out: (run_some_code) }
          } else if ($key.code == 'x') and ($key.modifiers == []) {
              print 'User exited'
              { out: null }
          } else if ($key.code == 'c') and ($key.modifiers == ['keymodifiers(control)']) {
              print 'Terminated with Ctrl-C'
              { out: null }
          } else {
              print "That key wasn't recognized."
              print 'Press (a) to run some code or (x) to Exit'
              # Next key generation
              { next: null }
          }
        }

        generate null $key_generator | get 0
        ```

    ## Using match statements with a list of keycodes

    The above examples use `if`/`else` statements with hard-coded key values. You may find it easier to maintain your code using `match` statements with a list of keycodes and modifiers. Using this technique, the second example above might look like:

    ```nu
    def run_some_code [] {
      print "I'm running the code and returning 42"
      42
    }

    let keys = {
      # [ key.code key.modifiers ]
      a:      [ 'a' [] ]
      x:      [ 'x' [] ]
      ctrl-c: [ 'c' ['keymodifiers(control)'] ]
    }
    mut key = {keycode: '', modifiers: ['']}
    print '(a) Run some code (x) Exit'

    loop {
      $key = (input listen --types [key])
      match [$key.code $key.modifiers] {
        $keymatch if $keymatch == $keys.a => {break}
        $keymatch if $keymatch == $keys.x  => {print 'User exited'; break}
        $keymatch if $keymatch == $keys.ctrl-c => {print 'Terminated with Ctrl-C'; break}
        _ => {
          print "That key wasn't recognized"
          print 'Press (a) to run some code or (x) to Exit'
          continue
        }
      }
    }

    # Act on the captured keypress from the mutable variable
    match [$key.code $key.modifiers] {
      $k if $k == $keys.a => {run_some_code}
    }
    ```

    title: Setup
    ---

    # Setup

    To get the most out of nu, it is important to setup your path and env for easy access.
    There are other ways to view these values and variables, however setting up your nu configuration will make it much easier as these have cross-platform support.

    ---

    ### Configure your path and other environment variables

    In order to configure your path in nushell you'll need to modify your `PATH` environment variable in your `config.nu` file. Open your `config.nu` file and put an entry in it like `$env.PATH = "path1;path2;path3"` ensuring that you use the proper path separation character, which is different by platform.

    Alternately, if you want to append a folder to your `PATH` environment variable you can do that too using the `append` or `prepend` command like this:

    ```nu
    $env.PATH = ($env.PATH | split row (char esep) | append "some/other/path")
    ```

    For more detailed instructions, see the documentation about [environment variables](/book/environment.html#setting-environment-variables) and [PATH configuration](/book/configuration.html#path-configuration).

    ### How to list your environment variables

    ```nu
    $env
    # => ─────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────
    # =>  ALLUSERSPROFILE                 │ C:\ProgramData
    # =>  CARGO_PKG_AUTHORS               │ The Nu Project Contributors
    # =>  CARGO_PKG_DESCRIPTION           │ A new type of shell
    # =>  CARGO_PKG_HOMEPAGE              │ https://www.nushell.sh
    # =>  CARGO_PKG_LICENSE               │ MIT
    # =>  CARGO_PKG_LICENSE_FILE          │
    # =>  CARGO_PKG_NAME                  │ nu
    # =>  CARGO_PKG_REPOSITORY            │ https://github.com/nushell/nushell
    # =>  CARGO_PKG_VERSION               │ 0.59.0
    # =>  CARGO_PKG_VERSION_MAJOR         │ 0
    ```

    Let's practise that and set `$EDITOR` in our `env.nu` file using `vim` (or an editor of your choice)

    ```nu
    vim $nu.env-path
    ```

    Note: if you've never used `vim` before and you want to leave typing `:q!` will close without saving.

    Go to the end of the file and add

    ```nu
    $env.EDITOR = 'vim'
    ```

    or `emacs`, `vscode` or whatever editor you like. Don't forget that the program needs to be accessible on the `PATH`
    and to reload your configuration with `exec nu` on linux/mac or restart your nushell on windows.

    You should now be able to run `config nu` or `config env` and edit those files easily.

    ### How to get a single environment variable's value

    ```nu
    $env.APPDATA
    ```
    ---

    ### Use hooks to export state via environment variables

    Additional tools like starship run with every prompt showing up in nushell.
    [`starship`](https://starship.rs) in particular replaces the default prompt with
    its own.
    To be most compatible, the `starship` binary will run every prompt render and
    is absolute stateless.
    Nushell, however, is very stateful in a single instance.

    [Hooks](https://www.nushell.sh/book/hooks.html#hooks) allow registration of
    custom callback functions.
    In this case, the `pre_prompt` hook is very useful.
    With it, we can export state information as an environment variable, for
    example, what [overlays](https://www.nushell.sh/book/overlays.html) are
    currently activated.

    ```nu
    # set NU_OVERLAYS with overlay list, useful for starship prompt
    $env.config.hooks.pre_prompt = ($env.config.hooks.pre_prompt | append {||
      let overlays = overlay list | range 1..
      if not ($overlays | is-empty) {
        $env.NU_OVERLAYS = $overlays | str join ", "
      } else {
        $env.NU_OVERLAYS = null
      }
    })
    ```

    Now in `starship`, we can use this environment variable to display what modules
    are active.

    ```toml
    [env_var.NU_OVERLAYS]
    symbol = '📌 '
    format = 'with [$symbol($env_value )]($style)'
    style = 'red'
    ```

    # Direnv

    Many people use [direnv](https://direnv.net) to load an environment upon entering a directory as well as unloading it when exiting the directory.
    Configuring direnv to work with nushell requires nushell version 0.66 or later.

    ---

    ### Configuring direnv

    To make direnv work with nushell the way it does with other shells, we can use the "hooks" functionality:

    ```nu
    $env.config = {
      hooks: {
        pre_prompt: [{ ||
          if (which direnv | is-empty) {
            return
          }

          direnv export json | from json | default {} | load-env
          if 'ENV_CONVERSIONS' in $env and 'PATH' in $env.ENV_CONVERSIONS {
            $env.PATH = do $env.ENV_CONVERSIONS.PATH.from_string $env.PATH
          }
        }]
      }
    }
    ```

    ::: tip Note
    you can follow the [`nu_scripts` of Nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/nu-hooks/nu-hooks/direnv/config.nu)
    for the always up-to-date version of the hook above

    # jq vs Nushell

    Both [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) and `nu` have the ability to transform data in a composable way. This cookbook will walk you through common data manipulation tasks with the aim of building a solid mental model for using Nushell effectively.

    All examples will stick to JSON to keep parity between examples.

    ## Consuming JSON

    Let's start with the basics: consuming a JSON string.

    In `jq`, inputs are always expected to be JSON so we simply do:

    ```sh
    echo '{"title": "jq vs Nushell", "publication_date": "2023-11-20"}' | jq -r '.'
    ```

    In `nu`, we need to be explicit because Nushell has a wider range of input choices:

    ```nu
    '{"title": "jq vs Nushell", "publication_date": "2023-11-20"}'
    | from json
    # => ╭──────────────────┬───────────────╮
    # => │ title            │ jq vs Nushell │
    # => │ publication_date │ 2023-11-20    │
    # => ╰──────────────────┴───────────────╯
    ```

    The output for `jq` is a JSON string whereas in `nu` it's a Nushell value. To get the output of any pipeline as JSON, simply apply a [`to json`](/commands/docs/to_json.html) at the end:

    ```nu
    '[{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}]'
    | from json
    | to json
    ```

    Output:

    ```json
    {
      "title": "jq vs Nushell",
      "publication_date": "2023-11-20"
    }
    ```

    When your JSON data is stored in a file, you can use [open](/commands/docs/open.html) instead of [from json](/commands/docs/from_json.html).

    Before we get into the examples, the following glossary can help familiarise yourself with how Nushell data types map to jq data types.

    | Nushell | jq             |
    | ------- | -------------- |
    | integer | number         |
    | decimal | number         |
    | string  | string         |
    | boolean | boolean        |
    | null    | null           |
    | list    | array          |
    | record  | object         |
    | table   | not applicable |
    | command | filter         |

    Documentation text:

    ## Basic operations

    ### Selecting values

    In `jq`, to get the value from an object we do:

    ```sh
    echo '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}' | jq -r '.name'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}' | from json | get name
    # => Alice
    ```

    ### Filtering lists

    In `jq`, to filter an array we do:

    ```sh
    echo '[{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}]' |
    jq -r '.[] | select(.age > 28)'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '[{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}]'
    | from json
    | where age > 28
    # => ╭───┬───────┬─────╮
    # => │ # │ name  │ age │
    # => ├───┼───────┼─────┤
    # => │ 0 │ Alice │  30 │
    # => ╰───┴───────┴─────╯
    ```

    ### Mapping over lists

    In `jq`, to map over a list we do:

    ```sh
    echo '[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]' |
    jq -r 'map(. * 2)'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]'
    | from json
    | each { |x| $x * 2 }
    # => ╭───┬────╮
    # => │ 0 │  2 │
    # => │ 1 │  4 │
    # => │ 2 │  6 │
    # => │ 3 │  8 │
    # => │ 4 │ 10 │
    # => ╰───┴────╯
    ```

    Note that you can rely on the `$in` auto-binding for a slightly more compact block:

    ```nu
    '[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]'
    | from json
    | each { $in * 2 }
    ```

    ### Mapping over records

    In `jq`, to map over a record we do:

    ```sh
    echo '{"items": [{"name": "Apple", "price": 1}, {"name": "Banana", "price": 0.5}]}' |
    jq -r '.items | map({(.name): (.price * 2)}) | add'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '{"items": [{"name": "Apple", "price": 1}, {"name": "Banana", "price": 0.5}]}'
    | from json
    | get items
    | update price {|row| $row.price * 2}
    # => ╭───┬────────┬───────╮
    # => │ # │  name  │ price │
    # => ├───┼────────┼───────┤
    # => │ 0 │ Apple  │     2 │
    # => │ 1 │ Banana │  1.00 │
    # => ╰───┴────────┴───────╯
    ```

    In this case nu does not require creating new records because we can leverage the fact that a list of records is a table. However, in other situations it might be required as we have seen in [Composing records](#composing-records).

    ### Sorting lists

    In `jq`, to sort a list we do:

    ```sh
    echo '[3, 1, 4, 2, 5]' |
    jq -r 'sort'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '[3, 1, 4, 2, 5]'
    | from json
    | sort
    # => ╭───┬───╮
    # => │ 0 │ 1 │
    # => │ 1 │ 2 │
    # => │ 2 │ 3 │

    # => ╰───┴───╯
    ```

    ### Filtering distinct values in a list

    In `jq`, to filter a list keeping unique values we do:

    ```sh
    echo '[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]' |
    jq -r 'unique'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]'
    | from json
    | uniq
    # => ╭───┬───╮
    # => │ 0 │ 1 │
    # => │ 1 │ 2 │
    # => │ 2 │ 3 │
    # => │ 3 │ 4 │
    # => │ 4 │ 5 │
    # => ╰───┴───╯
    ```

    ### Combining filters

    In `jq`, to combine filters we do:

    ```sh
    echo '[{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}]' |
    jq -r '.[] | select(.age > 28) | .name'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '[{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}]'
    | from json
    | where age > 28
    | get name
    # => ╭───┬───────╮
    # => │ 0 │ Alice │
    # => ╰───┴───────╯
    ```

    ### Splitting strings

    In `jq`, to split a string we do:

    ```sh
    echo '{"name": "Alice Smith"}' |
    jq -r '.name | split(" ") | .[0]'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '{"name": "Alice Smith"}'
    | from json
    | get name
    | split words
    | get 0
    # => Alice
    ```

    ### Conditional logic

    In `jq` to work with `if` expressions we do:

    ```sh
    echo '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}' |
    jq -r 'if .age > 18 then "Adult" else "Child" end'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}'
    | from json
    | if $in.age > 18 { "Adult" } else { "Child" }
    # => Adult
    ```

    ### Handling `null` values

    In `jq`, to filter out `null` values we do:

    ```sh
    echo '[1, null, 3, null, 5]' |
    jq -r 'map(select(. != null))'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '[1, null, 3, null, 5]'
    | from json
    | where { $in != null }
    # => ╭───┬───╮
    # => │ 0 │ 1 │
    # => │ 1 │ 3 │
    # => │ 2 │ 5 │
    # => ╰───┴───╯
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use [`compact`](/commands/docs/compact.html):

    ```nu
    '[1, null, 3, null, 5]'
    | from json
    | compact
    ```

    ### Formatting output

    In `jq`, to output a formatted string we do:

    ```sh
    echo '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}' |
    jq -r "Name: \(.name), Age: \(.age)"
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}'
    | from json
    | items { |key, value| ["Name" $value] | str join ": " }
    | str join ", "
    # => Name: Alice, Name: 30
    ```

    This approach is a bit involved but if we [install the full version](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases) which includes the _extra commands_ we can benefit from the [`format`](/commands/docs/format.html):

    ```nu
    '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}'
    | from json
    | format "Name: {name}, Age: {age}"
    ```

    ### Composing records

    In `jq`, to compose a new JSON object (akin to a record in Nushell) we do:

    ```sh
    echo '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}' |
    jq -r '{name: .name, age: (.age + 5)}'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}'
    | from json
    | {name: $in.name, age: ($in.age + 5)}
    # => ╭──────┬───────╮
    # => │ name │ Alice │
    # => │ age  │ 35    │
    # => ╰──────┴───────╯
    ```

    ## Dealing with nested items

    ### Filtering nested items

    In `jq`, to recursively filter a tree structure we do:

    ```sh
    echo '{"data": {"value": 42, "nested": {"value": 24}}}' |
    jq -r '.. | .value?'
    ```

    In `nu`, there is no built-in command to achieve this, however, we can define our own reusable commands. See the [Appendix: Custom commands](#appendix-custom-commands) for an implementation of the command `cherry-pick` shown in the example below.

    ```nu
    '{"data": {"value": 42, "nested": {"value": 24}}}'
    | from json
    | cherry-pick { |x| $x.value? }
    # => ╭───┬────╮
    # => │ 0 │    │
    # => │ 1 │ 42 │
    # => │ 2 │ 24 │
    # => ╰───┴────╯
    ```

    ### Filtering nested arrays

    In `jq`, to filter nested arrays we do:

    ```sh
    echo '{"data": [{"values": [1, 2, 3]}, {"values": [4, 5, 6]}]}' |
    jq -r '.data[].values[] | select(. > 3)'
    ```

    In `nu` we can take advantage of the fact that [a list of records is in fact a table](/book/types_of_data.html#tables) and simply do:

    ```nu
    '{"data": [{"values": [1, 2, 3]}, {"values": [4, 5, 6]}]}'
    | from json
    | get data.values
    | flatten
    | where {|x| $x > 3}
    # => ╭───┬───╮
    # => │ 0 │ 4 │
    # => │ 1 │ 5 │
    # => │ 2 │ 6 │
    # => ╰───┴───╯
    ```

    ### Flattening nested records

    In `jq`, to flatten all records preserving their path we do:

    ```sh
    echo '{"person": {"name": {"first": "Alice", "last": "Smith"}, "age": 30}}' |
    jq -r 'paths as $p | select(getpath($p) | type != "object") | ($p | join(".")) + " = " + (getpath($p) | tostring)'
    ```

    In `nu`, there is no built-in command to achieve this. See the [Appendix: Custom commands](#appendix-custom-commands) for an implementation of the command `flatten record-paths` shown in the example below.

    ```nu
    '{"person": {"name": {"first": "Alice", "last": "Smith"}, "age": 30}}'
    | from json
    | flatten record-paths
    # => ╭───┬───────────────────┬───────╮
    # => │ # │       path        │ value │
    # => ├───┼───────────────────┼───────┤
    # => │ 0 │ person.name.first │ Alice │
    # => │ 1 │ person.name.last  │ Smith │
    # => │ 2 │ person.age        │    30 │
    # => ╰───┴───────────────────┴───────╯
    ```

    ### Mapping over nested items

    In `jq`, to traverse a tree we can do:

    ```sh
    echo '{"data": {"value": 42, "nested": {"value": 24}}}' |
    jq -r 'recurse | .value? | select(. != null) | { value: (. * 5) } | add'
    ```

    In `nu`, there is no built-in function equivalent to `recurse`. However, we can reuse the solution from [Filtering nested items](#filtering-nested-items) to extract the values to manipulate:

    ```nu
    '{"data": {"value": 42, "nested": {"value": 24}}}'
    | from json
    | cherry-pick { |x| $x.value? }
    | compact
    | each { |x| $x * 5 }
    # => ╭───┬─────╮
    # => │ 0 │ 210 │
    # => │ 1 │ 120 │
    # => ╰───┴─────╯
    ```

    ### Filtering and mapping over nested items

    In `jq`, to filter and map over a tree we do:

    ```sh
    echo '{"data": {"values": [1, 2, 3], "nested": {"values": [4, 5, 6]}}}' |
    jq -r 'walk(if type == "number" then . * 2 else . end)'
    ```

    In `nu`, there is no built-in function to achieve this. See the [Appendix: Custom commands](#appendix-custom-commands) for an implementation of the command `filter-map` shown in the example below.

    ```nu
    '{"data": {"values": [1, 2, 3], "nested": {"values": [4, 5, 6]}}}'
    | from json
    | filter-map {|value| if ($value | describe) == "int" { $value * 2 } else { $value }}

    ## Grouping and aggregating

    ### Grouping records by key

    In `jq`, to group a list of records by key we do:

    ```sh
    echo '[{"category": "A", "value": 10}, {"category": "B", "value": 20}, {"category": "A", "value": 5}]' |
    jq -r 'group_by(.category)'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '[{"category": "A", "value": 10}, {"category": "B", "value": 20}, {"category": "A", "value": 5}]'
    | from json
    | group-by --to-table category
    # => ╭───┬───────┬──────────────────────────╮
    # => │ # │ group │          items           │
    # => ├───┼───────┼──────────────────────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ A     │ ╭───┬──────────┬───────╮ │
    # => │   │       │ │ # │ category │ value │ │
    # => │   │       │ ├───┼──────────┼───────┤ │
    # => │   │       │ │ 0 │ A        │    10 │ │
    # => │   │       │ │ 1 │ A        │     5 │ │
    # => │   │       │ ╰───┴──────────┴───────╯ │
    # => │ 1 │ B     │ ╭───┬──────────┬───────╮ │
    # => │   │       │ │ # │ category │ value │ │
    # => │   │       │ ├───┼──────────┼───────┤ │
    # => │   │       │ │ 0 │ B        │    20 │ │
    # => │   │       │ ╰───┴──────────┴───────╯ │
    # => ╰───┴───────┴──────────────────────────╯
    ```

    Note that `--to-table` was added to Nushell in [version 0.87.0](blog/2023-11-14-nushell_0_87_0.html). Before that you had to [`transpose`](/commands/docs/transpose) the record resulting from `group-by` which was substantially slower for large sets.

    ### Aggregating grouped values

    In `jq`, to aggregate grouped values we do:

    ```sh
    echo '[{"category": "A", "value": 10}, {"category": "B", "value": 20}, {"category": "A", "value": 5}]' |
    jq -r 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, sum: map(.value) | add})'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '[{"category": "A", "value": 10}, {"category": "B", "value": 20}, {"category": "A", "value": 5}]'
    | from json
    | group-by --to-table category
    | update items { |row| $row.items.value | math sum }
    | rename category sum
    ```

    ### Filtering after aggregating

    In `jq`, to filter after aggregating we do:

    ```sh
    echo '[{"category": "A", "value": 10}, {"category": "B", "value": 20}, {"category": "A", "value": 5}]' |
    jq -r 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, sum: (map(.value) | add)}) | .[] | select(.sum > 17)'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '[{"category": "A", "value": 10}, {"category": "B", "value": 20}, {"category": "A", "value": 5}]'
    | from json
    | group-by --to-table category
    | update items { |row| $row.items.value | math sum }
    | rename category value
    | where value > 17
    # => ╭───┬──────────┬───────╮
    # => │ # │ category │ value │
    # => ├───┼──────────┼───────┤
    # => │ 0 │ B        │    20 │
    # => ╰───┴──────────┴───────╯
    ```

    ### Custom aggregations

    In `jq`, to apply a custom aggregation we do:

    ```sh
    echo '[{"value": 10}, {"value": 20}, {"value": 30}]' |
    jq -r 'reduce .[] as $item (0; . + $item.value)'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '[{"value": 10}, {"value": 20}, {"value": 30}]'
    | from json
    | reduce -f 0 { |item, acc| $acc + $item.value }
    # => 60
    ```

    ## Other operations

    ### Calculating averages

    In `jq`, to calculate an average we do:

    ```sh
    echo '[{"score": 90}, {"score": 85}, {"score": 95}]' |
    jq -r 'map(.score) | add / length'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '[{"score": 90}, {"score": 85}, {"score": 95}]'
    | from json
    | get score
    | math avg
    # => 90
    ```

    ### Generating histogram bins

    In `jq`, to calculate bins for a histogram we do:

    ```sh
    echo '[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]' |
    jq -r 'group_by(. / 5 | floor * 5) | map({ bin: .[0], count: length })'
    ```

    In `nu` we do:

    ```nu
    '[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]'
    | from json
    | group-by --to-table { $in // 5 * 5 }
    | each { |row| {bin: $row.items.0, count: ($row.items | length)} }
    # => ╭───┬─────┬───────╮
    # => │ # │ bin │ count │
    # => ├───┼─────┼───────┤
    # => │ 0 │   1 │     4 │

    # Module Scenarios

    ## Dumping Files into Directory

    A common pattern in traditional shells is dumping and auto-sourcing files from a directory (for example, loading custom completions). In Nushell, doing this directly is currently not possible, but directory modules can still be used.

    Here we'll create a simple completion module with a submodule dedicated to some Git completions:

    1. Create the completion directory

       `mkdir ($nu.default-config-dir | path join completions)`

    2. Create an empty `mod.nu` for it

       `touch ($nu.default-config-dir | path join completions mod.nu)`

    3. Put the following snippet in `git.nu` under the `completions` directory

       ```nu
       export extern main [
           --version(-v)
           -C: string
           # ... etc.
       ]

       export extern add [
           --verbose(-v)
           --dry-run(-n)
           # ... etc.
       ]

       export extern checkout [
           branch: string@complete-git-branch
       ]

       def complete-git-branch [] {
           # ... code to list git branches
       }
       ```

    4. Add `export module git.nu` to `mod.nu`
    5. Add the parent of the `completions` directory to your `NU_LIB_DIRS` inside `env.nu`

       ```nu
       $env.NU_LIB_DIRS = [
           ...
           $nu.default-config-dir
       ]
       ```

    6. Import the completions to Nushell in your `config.nu`:

       `use completions *`

    Now you've set up a directory where you can put your completion files, and you should have some Git completions the next time you start Nushell.

    ::: tip Note
    This will use the file name (in our example `git` from `git.nu`) as the module name. This means some completions might not work if the definition has the base command in its name.
    For example, if you defined our known externals in our `git.nu` as `export extern 'git push' []`, etc. and followed the rest of the steps, you would get subcommands like `git git push`, etc.
    You would need to call `use completions git *` to get the desired subcommands. For this reason, using `main` as outlined in the step above is the preferred way to define subcommands.
    :::

    ## Overlay and "Virtual Environments"

    [Overlays](/book/overlays.md) are layers of definitions. We can make use of them to establish a temporary virtual environment, with custom environment variables, which we discard at the end.

    Our goals in this example are:

    * Activate a set of environment variables from a file called `env.json`
    * Work in this context
    * Discard the environment - restoring the original environment

    First, let's prepare an `env.json` for testing:

    ```nu
    { A: 1 B: 2 } | save env.json

    $env.A = 'zzz'

    print $"('A' in $env) ('B' in $env)"
    # => true false
    ```

    Now let's create a module `env` with a `load` command that loads the environment from `env.json`, and use it as an overlay:

    ```nu
    'export def --env load [] { open env.json | load-env }' | save env.nu

    overlay use ./env.nu

    overlay list
    # => ╭───┬──────╮
    # => │ 0 │ zero │
    # => │ 1 │ env  │
    # => ╰───┴──────╯
    ```

    Now we load the `env.json` file:

    ```nu
    load

    print $"($env.A) ($env.B)"
    # => 1 2
    ```

    To hide the overlay:

    ```nu
    overlay hide env

    print $"('A' in $env) ('B' in $env)"
    # => true false
    ```

    Note that - as documented in [Overlays](/book/overlays.md) - reactivating the overlay will recover the loaded environment variables,
    not create a new context for as long as the Nushell session remains active, despite `overlay list` no longer listing the overlay.

    More related information and specifically about environment variables and their modification can be found in [Environment](/book/environment.md), [Modules](/book/modules.md), [Overlay](/book/overlays.md),
    and the respective command documentation of [`def --env`](/commands/docs/def.md), [`export def --env`](/commands/docs/export_def.md), [`load-env`](/commands/docs/load-env.md), and [`export-env`](/commands/docs/export-env.md).

    ### Elaborate Virtual Environments

    This kind of overlaying environments can be used to scope more elaborate virtual environments, including changing the `PATH` environment variable, or other tool settings defined in environment variables or files.

    Tools like conda or Python virtualenv manage and isolate sets of environment variables.
    The [official virtualenv integration](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/blob/main/src/virtualenv/activation/nushell/activate.nu) makes use of these concepts.
    And our nu_scripts repository has a an [unofficial Conda module](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/tree/main/modules/virtual_environments).

    # Parsing

    *Nu* offers the ability to do some basic parsing, with different ways to achieve the same goal.

    Builtin-functions that can be used include:

    - `lines`
    - `detect columns`
    - `parse`
    - `str ...`
    - `from ssv`

    A few illustrative examples follow.

    ## Examples (tabular output)

    ### `detect columns` (pretty automatic)

    ```

    For an output like from `df` this is probably the most compact way to achieve a nice tabular output.
    The `str replace` is needed here because one of the column headers has a space in it.

    ### Using `from ssv`

    Also the builtin `from` data parser for `ssv` (*s*pace *s*eparated *v*alues) can be used:

    ```nu
    df -h | str replace "Mounted on" Mounted_On | from ssv --aligned-columns --minimum-spaces 1
    ```

    The output is identical to the previous example.

    `from ssv` supports several modifying flags to tweak its behaviour.

    Note we still need to fix the column headers if they contain unexpected spaces.

    ### Using `parse`

    How to parse an arbitrary pattern from a string of text into a multi-column table.

    ```nu
    cargo search shells --limit 10 | lines | parse "{crate_name} = {version} #{description}" | str trim
    # => ───┬──────────────┬─────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    # External Completers

    ## Completers

    ### Carapace completer

    ```nu
    let carapace_completer = {|spans|
        carapace $spans.0 nushell ...$spans | from json
    }
    ```

    ### Fish completer

    This completer will use [the fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) to handle completions. Fish handles out of the box completions for many popular tools and commands.

    ```nu
    let fish_completer = {|spans|
        fish --command $"complete '--do-complete=($spans | str join ' ')'"
        | from tsv --flexible --noheaders --no-infer
        | rename value description
        | update value {
            if ($in | path exists) {$'"($in | str replace "\"" "\\\"" )"'} else {$in}
        }
    }
    ```

    A couple of things to note on this command:

    - The fish completer will return lines of text, each one holding the `value` and `description` separated by a tab. The `description` can be missing, and in that case there won't be a tab after the `value`. If that happens, `from tsv` will fail, so we add the `--flexible` flag.
    - The output of the fish completer does not contain a header (name of the columns), so we add `--noheaders` to prevent `from tsv` from treating the first row as headers and later give the columns their names using `rename`.
    - `--no-infer` is optional. `from tsv` will infer the data type of the result, so a numeric value like some git hashes will be inferred as a number. `--no-infer` will keep everything as a string. It doesn't make a difference in practice but it will print a more consistent output if the completer is ran on it's own.
    - Since fish only supports POSIX style escapes for file paths (`file\ name.txt`, etc.), file paths completed by fish will not be quoted or escaped properly on external commands. Nushell does not parse POSIX escapes, so we need to do this conversion manually such as by testing if the items are valid paths as shown in the example. This simple approach is imperfect, but it should cover 99.9% of use cases.

    ### Zoxide completer

    [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) allows easily jumping between visited folders in the system. It's possible to autocomplete matching folders with this completer:

    ```nu
    let zoxide_completer = {|spans|
        $spans | skip 1 | zoxide query -l ...$in | lines | where {|x| $x != $env.PWD}
    }
    ```

    This completer is not usable for almost every other command, so it's recommended to add it as an override in the [multiple completer](#multiple-completer):

    ```nu
    {
        z => $zoxide_completer
        zi => $zoxide_completer
    }
    ```

    > **Note**
    > Zoxide sets an alias (`z` by default) that calls the `__zoxide_z` function.
    > If [alias completions](#alias-completions) are supported, the following snippet can be used instead:
    >
    > ```nu
    > {
    >     __zoxide_z => $zoxide_completer
    >     __zoxide_zi => $zoxide_completer
    > }
    > ```

    ### Multiple completer

    Sometimes, a single external completer is not flexible enough. Luckily, as many as needed can be combined into a single one. The following example uses `$default_completer` for all commands except the ones explicitly defined in the record:

    ```nu
    let multiple_completers = {|spans|
        match $spans.0 {
            ls => $ls_completer
            git => $git_completer
            _ => $default_completer
        } | do $in $spans
    }
    ```

    > **Note**
    > In the example above, `$spans.0` is the command being run at the time. The completer will match the desired completer, and fallback to `$default_completer`.
    >
    > - If we try to autocomplete `git <tab>`, `spans` will be `[git ""]`. `match $spans.0 { ... }` will return the `$git_completer`.
    > - If we try to autocomplete `other_command <tab>`, `spans` will be `[other_command ""]`. The match will fallback to the default case (`_`) and return the `$default_completer`.

    ## Troubleshooting

    ### Alias completions

    Nushell currently has a [bug where autocompletions won't work for aliases](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/8483). This can be worked around adding the following snippet at the beginning of the completer:

    ```nu
    # if the current command is an alias, get it's expansion
    let expanded_alias = (scope aliases | where name == $spans.0 | get -i 0 | get -i expansion)

    # overwrite
    let spans = (if $expanded_alias != null  {
        # put the first word of the expanded alias first in the span
        $spans | skip 1 | prepend ($expanded_alias | split row " " | take 1)
    } else { $spans })
    ```

    This code will take the first span, find the first alias that matches it, and replace the beginning of the command with the alias expansion.

    ### `ERR unknown shorthand flag` using carapace

    Carapace will return this error when a non-supported flag is provided. For example, with `cargo -1`:

    | value | description                       |
    | ----- | --------------------------------- |
    | -1ERR | unknown shorthand flag: "1" in -1 |
    | -1\_  |                                   |

    The solution to this involves manually checking the value to filter it out:

    ```nu
    let carapace_completer = {|spans: list<string>|
        carapace $spans.0 nushell ...$spans
        | from json
        | if ($in | default [] | where value == $"($spans | last)ERR" | is-empty) { $in } else { null }
    }
    ```

    ## Putting it all together

    This is an example of how an external completer definition might look like:

    ```nu
    let fish_completer = ...

    let carapace_completer = {|spans: list<string>|
        carapace $spans.0 nushell ...$spans
        | from json
        | if ($in | default [] | where value =~ '^-.*ERR$' | is-empty) { $in } else { null }
    }

    # This completer will use carapace by default
    let external_completer = {|spans|
        let expanded_alias = scope aliases
        | where name == $spans.0
        | get -i 0.expansion

        let spans = if $expanded_alias != null {
            $spans
            | skip 1
            | prepend ($expanded_alias | split row ' ' | take 1)
        } else {
            $spans
        }

        match $spans.0 {
            # carapace completions are incorrect for nu
            nu => $fish_completer
            # fish completes commits and branch names in a nicer way
            git => $fish_completer
            # carapace doesn't have completions for asdf
            asdf => $fish_completer
            # use zoxide completions for zoxide commands
            __zoxide_z | __zoxide_zi => $zoxide_completer
            _ => $carapace_completer
        } | do $in $spans
    }

    $env.config = {
        # ...
        completions: {
            external: {
                enable: true
                completer: $external_completer
            }
        }
        # ...
    }
    ```

    ### Find processes sorted by greatest cpu utilization.

    ```nu

    ### Find and kill a hanging process

    Sometimes a process doesn't shut down correctly. Using `ps` it's fairly easy to find the pid of this process:

    ```nu
    ps | where name == Notepad2.exe
    # => ───┬──────┬──────────────┬──────┬─────────┬─────────
    # =>  # │ pid  │     name     │ cpu  │   mem   │ virtual
    # => ───┼──────┼──────────────┼──────┼─────────┼─────────
    # =>  0 │ 9268 │ Notepad2.exe │ 0.00 │ 32.0 MB │  9.8 MB
    # => ───┴──────┴──────────────┴──────┴─────────┴─────────
    ```

    This process can be sent the kill signal in a one-liner:

    ```nu
    ps | where name == Notepad2.exe | get pid.0 | kill $in
    # => ───┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    # =>  0 │ SUCCESS: Sent termination signal to the process with PID 9268.
    # => ───┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ```

    Notes:

    - `kill` is a built-in Nu command that works on all platforms. If you wish to use the classic Unix `kill` command, you can do so with `^kill`.
    - Filtering with the `where` command as shown above is case-sensitive.

    # Git

    Nu can help with common `Git` tasks like removing all local branches which have been merged into master.

    ### Delete git merged branches

    **Warning**: This command will hard delete the merged branches from your machine. You may want to check the branches selected for deletion by omitting the last git command.

    ```nu
    git branch --merged | lines | where ($it != "* master" and $it != "* main") | each {|br| git branch -D ($br | str trim) } | str trim
    # => ───┬───────────────────────────────────────────
    # =>  0 │ Deleted branch start_urls (was fc01bb45).

    title: Foreign Shell Scripts
    ---

    # Working With Foreign Shell Scripts

    A common issue with nu is, that other applications export environment variables
    or functionality as shell scripts, that are expected to then be evaluated by
    your shell.

    But many applications only consider the most commonly used shells like `bash` or
    `zsh`. Unfortunately, nu has entirely incompatible syntax with these shells, so
    it cannot run or `source` these scripts directly.

    Generally nothing stops you from running a `zsh` script by invoking `zsh` itself
    (given it is installed). But unfortunately this will not allow nu to access
    exported environment variables:

    ```nu
    # This works, using zsh to print "Hello"
    'echo Hello' | zsh -c $in

    # This exits with an error because $env.VAR is not defined
    'export VAR="Hello"' | zsh -c $in
    print $env.VAR
    ```

    This chapter presents two workarounds for getting around this issue, and the
    involved drawbacks.

    ---

    ## Parsing a Script as a String

    A naive workaround to extract environment variable declarations is to read the
    foreign script as a string and parse anything that looks like a variable
    declaration, so it can be loaded into nushell's environment.

    ```nu
    let bash_greeting = '
    export GREETING="Hello";
    export FROM="from bash";
    '

    load-env (
      $bash_greeting
      | str trim
      | lines
      | parse 'export {name}="{value}";'
      | transpose --header-row --as-record
    )

    print $"($env.GREETING) ($env.FROM)" # "Hello from bash"
    ```

    This is perfectly fine for situations where you are sure of the exact format of
    the script and can predict parsing edge cases.

    This quickly gets tricky though, for example when the script is declaring a
    `PATH` variable that references its previous value
    (`export PATH="$PATH:/extra/path";`).

    There are ways to implement some form of expansion too, but at some point it
    might make more sense to leave the parsing to the shell it was meant for.

    ## Bash Env Plugin

    There is a third-party Nu plugin [bash-env](https://github.com/tesujimath/nu_plugin_bash_env)
    for importing environment variables from Bash format files and pipes.
    This plugin uses Bash itself to parse the environment definitions,
    and can therefore cope with arbitrarily complex Bash sources.

    ::: warning
    Please note that the `bash-env` plugin is not supported by the core Nushell team.
    All issues and requests for support should be directed to its own
    [issue tracker](https://github.com/tesujimath/nu_plugin_bash_env/issues).

    ## Capturing the environment from a foreign shell script

    A more complex approach is to run the script in the shell it is written for and
    then do some hackery to capture the script's variables afterwards.

    Note: The shown command assumes a Unix-like operating system, it may also be
    possible to implement one for Windows that could capture variables from a
    PowerShell script.

    ```nu
    # Returns a record of changed env variables after running a non-nushell script's contents (passed via stdin), e.g. a bash script you want to "source"
    def capture-foreign-env [
        --shell (-s): string = /bin/sh
        # The shell to run the script in
        # (has to support '-c' argument and POSIX 'env', 'echo', 'eval' commands)
        --arguments (-a): list<string> = []
        # Additional command line arguments to pass to the foreign shell
    ] {
        let script_contents = $in;
        let env_out = with-env { SCRIPT_TO_SOURCE: $script_contents } {
            ^$shell ...$arguments -c `
            env
            echo '<ENV_CAPTURE_EVAL_FENCE>'
            eval "$SCRIPT_TO_SOURCE"
            echo '<ENV_CAPTURE_EVAL_FENCE>'
            env -u _ -u _AST_FEATURES -u SHLVL` # Filter out known changing variables
        }
        | split row '<ENV_CAPTURE_EVAL_FENCE>'
        | {
            before: ($in | first | str trim | lines)
            after: ($in | last | str trim | lines)
        }

        # Unfortunate Assumption:
        # No changed env var contains newlines (not cleanly parseable)
        $env_out.after
        | where { |line| $line not-in $env_out.before } # Only get changed lines
        | parse "{key}={value}"
        | transpose --header-row --as-record
    }
    ```

    Usage, e.g. in `env.nu`:

    ```nu
    # Default usage, running the script with `/bin/sh`
    load-env (open script.sh | capture-foreign-env)

    # Running a different shell's script
    # fish might be elsewhere on your system, if it's in the PATH, `fish` is enough
    load-env (open script.fish | capture-foreign-env --shell /usr/local/bin/fish)
    ```

    The command runs a foreign shell script and captures the changed environment
    variables after running the script. This is done by parsing output of the `env`
    command available on unix-like systems. The shell to execute can be specified
    and configured using the `--shell` and `--arguments` parameters, the command has
    been tested using sh (-> bash), bash, zsh, fish, ksh, and dash.

    ::: warning
    A caveat for this approach is that it requires all changed environment variables
    not to include newline characters, as the UNIX `env` output is not cleanly
    parseable in that case.

    Also beware that directly passing the output of `capture-foreign-env` to
    `load-env` can result in changed variables like `PATH` to become strings again,
    even if they have been converted to a list before.
    :::

    ### Detailed Explanation of `capture-foreign-env`

    Let's have a look at the command's signature first:

    ```nu
    def capture-foreign-env [
        --shell (-s): string = /bin/sh
        # The shell to run the script in
        # (has to support '-c' argument and POSIX 'env', 'echo', 'eval' commands)
        --arguments (-a): list<string> = []
        # Additional command line arguments to pass to the foreign shell
    ] {
        let script_contents = $in;
        # ...
    }
    ```

    We're declaring a custom command that takes two optional flags:

    - `--shell` to specify a shell to run the script in, (e.g. `bash`)
    - `--arguments` to parse further command line arguments to that shell.

    The actual script is not mentioned here, because it is read using the special
    `$in` variable that represents anything passed to Standard Input (`stdin`), e.g.
    via a pipe.

    The shell is set to `/bin/sh` by default, because this is often considered the
    "default" POSIX-compatible shell of UNIX-like systems, e.g. macOS or Linux. It
    is often not running the original Bourne shell (`sh`), but linking to a
    different shell, like `bash`, with some compatibility flags turned on.

    As such, many "generic" shell scripts to source are compatible with the system'
    s `/bin/sh`.

    Now, let's have a look at where the shell is actually run:

    ```nu
    let env_out = with-env { SCRIPT_TO_SOURCE: $script_contents } {
        ^$shell ...$arguments -c ` ... `
    }
    ```

    Essentially, this calls the specified shell (using `^` to run the value as a
    command) with any arguments specified. It also passes `-c` with an inlined
    script for the shell, which is the syntax to immediately execute a passed script
    and exit in most shells.

    The `with-env { SCRIPT_TO_SOURCE: $script_contents }` block defines an
    additional environment variable with the actual script we want to run. This is
    used to pass the script in an unescaped string form, where the executing shell is entirely responsible for parsing it. The alternatives would have been:

    - Passing the script via `-c $script`, but then we couldn't (safely) add our own
      commands to log out the environment variables after the script ran.
    - Using string interpolation, but then we would be responsible for fully
      escaping the script, so that the `eval "($script)"` line doesn't break due to
      quotation marks. With the variable expansion in the foreign shell, that shell
      does not need the value to be escaped; just as nu is normally able to pass a
      string with any contents to a command as a single string argument.
    - Using a (temporary or existing) file containing the script - This would also
      work, but seems unnecessary and potentially slower.

    Then the external shell executes the script we passed:

    ```bash
    env
    echo '<ENV_CAPTURE_EVAL_FENCE>'
    eval "$SCRIPT_TO_SOURCE"
    echo '<ENV_CAPTURE_EVAL_FENCE>'
    env -u _ -u _AST_FEATURES -u SHLVL
    ```

    These POSIX-shell compatible commands, available in UNIX-like OSes, do the
    following:

    1. Log out all environment variables at the start of the script. These may be
       different than the ones in nushell, because the shell might have defined
       variables on startup and all passed-in variables have been serialized to
       strings by nushell.
    2. Log `<ENV_CAPTURE_EVAL_FENCE>` to stdout, this is so we later know where the
       first `env` output stopped. The content of this is arbitrary, but it is
       verbose to reduce the risk of any env var having this string in its contents.
    3. Run the actual shell script in the current context, using `eval`. The double
       quotes around the variable are necessary to get newlines to be interpreted
       correctly.
    4. Log the "fence" again to stdout so we know where the "after" list of
       variables starts.
    5. Log all environment variables after the script run. We are excluding a few
       variables here that are commonly changed by a few shells that have nothing to
       do with the particular script that was run.

    We then take the script output and save all lines from the `env` output before
    and after running the passed script, using the `<ENV_CAPTURE_EVAL_FENCE>` logs.

    ```nu
    # <shell invocation>
    | split row '<ENV_CAPTURE_EVAL_FENCE>'
    | {
        before: ($in | first | str trim | lines)
        after: ($in | last | str trim | lines)
    }
    ```

    Finally, all that is left to do is to take all env-output lines from the "after"
    output that were not there before, and parse them into a record:

    ```nu
    $env_out.after
        | where { |line| $line not-in $env_out.before } # Only get changed lines
        | parse "{key}={value}"
        | transpose --header-row --as-record
    ```

    title: Pattern Matching
    ---

    # Pattern Matching

    ## Using the `match` keyword

    Like many other languages, nu offers a [`match`](https://www.nushell.sh/commands/docs/match.html#frontmatter-title-for-core) keyword. Usually this is used as a slightly more ergonomic version of `if-else` statements if you have many branches

    ```nu
    [black red yellow green purple blue indigo] | each {|c|
      match $c {
        "black" => "classy"
        "red" | "green" | "blue" => "fundamental"
        "yellow" | "purple" => "vibrant"
        _ => "innovative"
      }
    }
    # => ───┬────────────
    # =>  0 │ classy
    # =>  1 │ funamental
    # =>  2 │ vibrant
    # =>  3 │ funamental
    # =>  4 │ vibrant
    # =>  5 │ funamental
    # =>  6 │ innovative
    # => ───┴────────────
    ```

    The equivalent in `if-else` statements would be:

    ```nu
    [black red yellow green purple blue] | each {|c|
      if ($c == "black") {
       "classy"
      } else if ($c in ["red", "green", "blue"]) {
        "fundamental"
      } else if ($c in ['yellow', "purple"]) {
        "vibrant"
      } else {
        "innovative"
      }
    }
    ```

    As you can see you can also use command expressions in match statements (in this case used with `|`). Also notice the `_` case at the end, this is called the default arm and is used in case none of the other patterns match. Note also that in the case that cases overlap the first matching pattern will be used (just like with `if-else` statements):

    ```nu
    [yellow green] | each {|c|
      match $c {
        "green" => "fundamental"
        "yellow" | "green" => "vibrant"
      }
    }
    # => ───┬────────────
    # =>  0 │ vibrant
    # =>  1 │ funamental
    # => ───┴────────────
    ```

    ## Pattern matching on types

    You can use the [`describe`](https://www.nushell.sh/commands/docs/describe.html) command to get more info about the types of values. For example:

    ```nu
    {one: 1 two: 2} | describe
    # => record<one: int, two: int>
    ```

    ```nu
    [{a: 1 b: 2} {a: 2 b:3 }] | describe
    # => table<a: int, b: int>
    ```

    Together with `match` and some clever regex use you can do quite powerful type matching. For example, let's say we wanted to implement a `str append` function that would work on both strings and lists. On strings it would work as expected, on lists of strings, it should append the same string to each element of the list. Using `match` one might do that like so:

    ```nu
    def "str append" [tail: string]: [string -> string, list<string> -> list<string>] {
        let input = $in
        match ($input | describe | str replace --regex '<.*' '') {
            "string" => { $input ++ $tail },
            "list" => { $input | each {|el| $el ++ $tail} },
            _ => $input
        }
    }
    ```

    The `$input | describe` would output for example `string` if the input was a string, and for example `list<any>` for a list containing multiple different types. The regex, removes everying after the first `<` leaving us just with `list`.

    Then with the `match` statement we can handle the different types separately. Finally in the default case we just return the input unaltered so that other types can simply pass through this filter without issue.
    Also note that we have to capture the `$in` variable on the first statement of the function to still have access to it in each `match` arm.

    With this implementation we can check that the command works as expected:

    ```nu
    use std/assert
    assert equal ("foo" | str append "/") "foo/"
    assert equal (["foo", "bar", "baz"] | str append "/") ["foo/", "bar/", "baz/"]
    ```

    ### Editing a file and then saving the changes

    Here we are making edits to `Cargo.toml`. We increase the patch version of the crate using `inc` and then save it back to the file.
    Use `help inc` to get more information.

    Read the file's initial contents

    ```nu
    open Cargo.toml | get package.version
    ```

    Output

    `0.59.0`

    Make the edit to the version number and save it.

    _Note: running this command should work but it will reorder the toml file alphabetically by section._

    ```nu
    open Cargo.toml | upsert package.version { |p| $p | get package.version | inc --patch } | save -f Cargo.toml
    ```

    Note: `inc` is available through the plugin `nu_plugin_inc`.

    Output
    _none_

    View the changes we made to the file.

    ### Parsing a file in a non-standard format

    Suppose you have a file with the following format.

    ```text
    band:album:year
    Fugazi:Steady Diet of Nothing:1991
    Fugazi:The Argument:2001
    Fugazi:7 Songs:1988
    Fugazi:Repeater:1990
    Fugazi:In On The Kill Taker:1993
    ```

    You can parse it into a table.

    ```nu
    open bands.txt | lines | split column ":" Band Album Year | skip 1 | sort-by Year
    # => ━━━┯━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━
    # =>  # │ Band   │ Album                  │ Year
    # => ───┼────────┼────────────────────────┼──────
    # =>  0 │ Fugazi │ 7 Songs                │ 1988
    # =>  1 │ Fugazi │ Repeater               │ 1990
    # =>  2 │ Fugazi │ Steady Diet of Nothing │ 1991
    # =>  3 │ Fugazi │ In On The Kill Taker   │ 1993
    # =>  4 │ Fugazi │ The Argument           │ 2001
    # => ━━━┷━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━
    ```

    You can alternatively do this using `parse`.

    ```nu
    open bands.txt | lines | parse "{Band}:{Album}:{Year}" | skip 1 | sort-by Year
    ```

    Or, you can utilize the `headers` command to use the first row as a header row. The only difference would be the headers would match the case of the text file. So, in this case, the headers would be lowercase.

    ```nu
    open bands.txt | lines | split column ":" | headers | sort-by year
    ```

    ### Word occurrence count with Ripgrep

    Suppose you would like to check the number of lines the string "Value" appears per file in the nushell project, then sort those files by largest line count.

    ```nu
    rg -c Value | lines | split column ":" file line_count | into int line_count | sort-by line_count | reverse
    # => ───┬──────────────────────────────────────┬────────────
    # =>  # │ file                                 │ line_count

    # Let's parse git log

    This `git log` command is interesting but you can't do a lot with it like this.

    ```nu

    That's more like nushell, but it would be nice to have some columns.

    We used the delimiter `»¦«` specifically so we can create columns so let's use it like this.

    ```nu

    Yay, for columns! But wait, it would really be nice if those columns had something other than generically named column names.

    Let's try adding the columns names to `split column` like this.

    Ahhh, that looks much better.

    Hmmm, that date string is a string. If it were a date vs a string it could be used for sorting by date. The way we do that is we have to convert the datetime to a real datetime and update the column. Try this.

    ```nu
    git log --pretty=%h»¦«%s»¦«%aN»¦«%aE»¦«%aD -n 5 | lines | split column "»¦«" commit subject name email date | upsert date {|d| $d.date | into datetime}

    Now this looks more nu-ish

    If we want to revert back to a date string we can do something like this with the `nth` command and the `get` command.

    ```nu
    git log --pretty=%h»¦«%s»¦«%aN»¦«%aE»¦«%aD -n 5 | lines | split column "»¦«" commit subject name email date | upsert date {|d| $d.date | into datetime} | select 3 | get date | format date | get 0
    # => Mon, 28 Feb 2022 18:31:53 -0500
    ```

    Cool! Now that we have a real datetime we can do some interesting things with it like `group-by` or `sort-by` or `where`.
    Let's try `sort-by` first

    ```nu
    git log --pretty=%h»¦«%s»¦«%aN»¦«%aE»¦«%aD -n 25 | lines | split column "»¦«" commit subject name email date | upsert date {|d| $d.date | into datetime} | sort-by date

    That's neat but what if I want it sorted in the opposite order? Try the `reverse` command and notice the newest commits are at the top.

    Now let's try `group-by` and see what happens. This is a tiny bit tricky because dates are tricky. When you use `group-by` on dates you have to remember to use the `group-by date` subcommand so it's `group-by date date_column_name`.

    ```nu
    git log --pretty=%h»¦«%s»¦«%aN»¦«%aE»¦«%aD -n 25 | lines | split column "»¦«" commit subject name email date | upsert date {|d| $d.date | into datetime | format date '%Y-%m-%d'} | group-by date
    # => ────────────┬────────────────
    # =>  2022-03-01 │ [table 3 rows]
    # =>  2022-02-28 │ [table 8 rows]
    # =>  2022-02-27 │ [table 8 rows]
    # =>  2022-02-26 │ [table 5 rows]
    # =>  2022-02-25 │ [table 1 row]
    # => ────────────┴────────────────
    ```

    This would look better if we transpose the data and name the columns

    ```nu
    git log --pretty=%h»¦«%s»¦«%aN»¦«%aE»¦«%aD -n 25 | lines | split column "»¦«" commit subject name email date | upsert date {|d| $d.date | into datetime | format date '%Y-%m-%d'} | group-by date | transpose date count

    Now, with the 365 day slice of data, let's `group-by` name where the commits are less than a year old. This table has a lot of columns so it's unreadable. However, if we `group-by` name and `transpose` the table things will look much cleaner. `Pivot` takes rows and turns them into columns or turns columns into rows.

    ```nu
    git log --pretty=%h»¦«%s»¦«%aN»¦«%aE»¦«%aD | lines | split column "»¦«" commit subject name email date | upsert date {|d| $d.date | into datetime} | where ($it.date > ((date now) - 365day)) | group-by name | transpose

    Side note: If you happen to get errors, pay attention to the error message. For instance, this error means that the data being returned from `git log` is somehow incomplete. Specifically, there is a missing date column. I've seen git commands work perfectly on Windows and not work at all on Linux or Mac. I'm not sure why. If you run into this issue, one easy way to temporarily avoid it is to limit `git log` results to a certain number like `git log -n 100`.

    Documentation text:

    Here's one tip for dealing with this error. We have a `do` command that has an `--ignore_errors` parameter. This is how you'd use it in the above example, if it were giving errors.

    ```nu
    git log --pretty=%h»¦«%s»¦«%aN»¦«%aE»¦«%aD | lines | do -i { split column "»¦«" commit subject name email date } | upsert date {|d| $d.date | into datetime} | where ($it.date > ((date now) - 365day)) | group-by name | transpose
    ```

    Now, back to parsing.
    What if we throw in the `sort-by` and `reverse` commands for good measure? Also, while we're in there, let's get rid of the `[table 21 rows]` thing too. We do that by using the `length` command on each row of column1.

    ```nu
    git log --pretty=%h»¦«%s»¦«%aN»¦«%aE»¦«%aD | lines | split column "»¦«" commit subject name email date | upsert date {|d| $d.date | into datetime} | where ($it.date > ((date now) - 365day)) | group-by name | transpose | upsert column1 {|c| $c.column1 | length} | sort-by column1 | reverse

    # Working with Tables

    [[toc]]

    ## Overview

    One of the common ways of seeing data in Nu is through a table. Nu comes with a number of commands for working with tables to make it convenient to find what you're looking for, and for narrowing down the data to just what you need.

    To start off, let's get a table that we can use:

    ```nu
    ls
    # => ───┬───────────────┬──────┬─────────┬────────────
    # =>  # │ name          │ type │ size    │ modified
    # => ───┼───────────────┼──────┼─────────┼────────────
    # =>  0 │ files.rs      │ File │  4.6 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  1 │ lib.rs        │ File │   330 B │ 5 days ago
    # =>  2 │ lite_parse.rs │ File │  6.3 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  3 │ parse.rs      │ File │ 49.8 KB │ 1 day ago
    # =>  4 │ path.rs       │ File │  2.1 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  5 │ shapes.rs     │ File │  4.7 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  6 │ signature.rs  │ File │  1.2 KB │ 5 days ago
    # => ───┴───────────────┴──────┴─────────┴────────────
    ```

    ::: tip Changing how tables are displayed
    Nu will try to expands all table's structure by default. You can change this behavior by changing the `display_output` hook.
    See [hooks](/book/hooks.md#changing-how-output-is-displayed) for more information.

    ## Sorting the Data

    We can sort a table by calling the [`sort-by`](/commands/docs/sort-by.md) command and telling it which columns we want to use in the sort. Let's say we wanted to sort our table by the size of the file:

    ```nu
    ls | sort-by size
    # => ───┬───────────────┬──────┬─────────┬────────────
    # =>  # │ name          │ type │ size    │ modified
    # => ───┼───────────────┼──────┼─────────┼────────────
    # =>  0 │ lib.rs        │ File │   330 B │ 5 days ago
    # =>  1 │ signature.rs  │ File │  1.2 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  2 │ path.rs       │ File │  2.1 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  3 │ files.rs      │ File │  4.6 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  4 │ shapes.rs     │ File │  4.7 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  5 │ lite_parse.rs │ File │  6.3 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  6 │ parse.rs      │ File │ 49.8 KB │ 1 day ago
    # => ───┴───────────────┴──────┴─────────┴────────────
    ```

    We can sort a table by any column that can be compared. For example, we could also have sorted the above using the "name", "accessed", or "modified" columns.

    For more info on sorting, see [Sorting](/book/sorting.md).

    ## Selecting the Data you Want

    ::: tip Note
    The following is a basic overview. For a more in-depth discussion of this topic, see the chapter, [Navigating and Accessing Structured Data](/book/navigating_structured_data.md).
    :::

    We can select data from a table by choosing to select specific columns or specific rows. Let's [`select`](/commands/docs/select.md) a few columns from our table to use:

    ```nu
    ls | select name size
    # => ───┬───────────────┬─────────
    # =>  # │ name          │ size
    # => ───┼───────────────┼─────────
    # =>  0 │ files.rs      │  4.6 KB
    # =>  1 │ lib.rs        │   330 B
    # =>  2 │ lite_parse.rs │  6.3 KB
    # =>  3 │ parse.rs      │ 49.8 KB
    # =>  4 │ path.rs       │  2.1 KB
    # =>  5 │ shapes.rs     │  4.7 KB
    # =>  6 │ signature.rs  │  1.2 KB
    # => ───┴───────────────┴─────────
    ```

    This helps to create a table that's more focused on what we need. Next, let's say we want to only look at the 5 smallest files in this directory:

    ```nu
    ls | sort-by size | first 5
    # => ───┬──────────────┬──────┬────────┬────────────
    # =>  # │ name         │ type │ size   │ modified
    # => ───┼──────────────┼──────┼────────┼────────────
    # =>  0 │ lib.rs       │ File │  330 B │ 5 days ago
    # =>  1 │ signature.rs │ File │ 1.2 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  2 │ path.rs      │ File │ 2.1 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  3 │ files.rs     │ File │ 4.6 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  4 │ shapes.rs    │ File │ 4.7 KB │ 5 days ago
    # => ───┴──────────────┴──────┴────────┴────────────
    ```

    You'll notice we first sort the table by size to get to the smallest file, and then we use the `first 5` to return the first 5 rows of the table.

    You can also [`skip`](/commands/docs/skip.md) rows that you don't want. Let's skip the first two of the 5 rows we returned above:

    ```nu
    ls | sort-by size | first 5 | skip 2
    # => ───┬───────────┬──────┬────────┬────────────
    # =>  # │ name      │ type │ size   │ modified
    # => ───┼───────────┼──────┼────────┼────────────
    # =>  0 │ path.rs   │ File │ 2.1 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  1 │ files.rs  │ File │ 4.6 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  2 │ shapes.rs │ File │ 4.7 KB │ 5 days ago
    # => ───┴───────────┴──────┴────────┴────────────
    ```

    We've narrowed it to three rows we care about.

    Let's look at a few other commands for selecting data. You may have wondered why the rows of the table are numbers. This acts as a handy way to get to a single row. Let's sort our table by the file name and then pick one of the rows with the [`select`](/commands/docs/select.md) command using its row number:

    ```nu
    ls | sort-by name
    # => ───┬───────────────┬──────┬─────────┬────────────
    # =>  # │ name          │ type │ size    │ modified
    # => ───┼───────────────┼──────┼─────────┼────────────
    # =>  0 │ files.rs      │ File │  4.6 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  1 │ lib.rs        │ File │   330 B │ 5 days ago
    # =>  2 │ lite_parse.rs │ File │  6.3 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  3 │ parse.rs      │ File │ 49.8 KB │ 1 day ago
    # =>  4 │ path.rs       │ File │  2.1 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  5 │ shapes.rs     │ File │  4.7 KB │ 5 days ago
    # =>  6 │ signature.rs  │ File │  1.2 KB │ 5 days ago
    # => ───┴───────────────┴──────┴─────────┴────────────

    ls | sort-by name | select 5
    # => ───┬───────────────┬──────┬─────────┬────────────
    # =>  # │ name          │ type │ size    │ modified
    # => ───┼───────────────┼──────┼─────────┼────────────
    # =>  0 │ shapes.rs     │ File │  4.7 KB │ 5 days ago

    Documentation text:

    ## Getting Data out of a Table

    So far, we've worked with tables by trimming the table down to only what we need. Sometimes we may want to go a step further and only look at the values in the cells themselves rather than taking a whole column. Let's say, for example, we wanted to only get a list of the names of the files. For this, we use the [`get`](/commands/docs/get.md) command:

    ```nu
    ls | get name
    # => ───┬───────────────
    # =>  0 │ files.rs
    # =>  1 │ lib.rs
    # =>  2 │ lite_parse.rs
    # =>  3 │ parse.rs
    # =>  4 │ path.rs
    # =>  5 │ shapes.rs
    # =>  6 │ signature.rs
    # => ───┴───────────────
    ```

    We now have the values for each of the filenames.

    This might look like the [`select`](/commands/docs/select.md) command we saw earlier, so let's put that here as well to compare the two:

    ```nu
    ls | select name
    # => ───┬───────────────
    # =>  # │ name
    # => ───┼───────────────
    # =>  0 │ files.rs
    # =>  1 │ lib.rs
    # =>  2 │ lite_parse.rs
    # =>  3 │ parse.rs
    # =>  4 │ path.rs
    # =>  5 │ shapes.rs
    # =>  6 │ signature.rs
    # => ───┴───────────────
    ```

    These look very similar! Let's see if we can spell out the difference between these two commands to make it clear:

    - [`select`](/commands/docs/select.md) - creates a new table which includes only the columns specified
    - [`get`](/commands/docs/get.md) - returns the values inside the column specified as a list

    :::tip
    The arguments provided to `select` and `get` are [cell-paths](/book/types_of_data.html#cell-paths), a fundamental part of Nu's query language. For a more in-depth discussion of cell-paths and other navigation topics, see the next chapter, [Navigating and Accessing Structured Data](/book/navigating_structured_data.md).

    Documentation text:

    ## Changing Data in a Table

    In addition to selecting data from a table, we can also update what the table has. We may want to combine tables, add new columns, or edit the contents of a cell. In Nu, rather than editing in place, each of the commands in the section will return a new table in the pipeline.

    ### Concatenating Tables

    We can concatenate tables using [`append`](/commands/docs/append.md):

    ```nu
    let first = [[a b]; [1 2]]
    let second = [[a b]; [3 4]]
    $first | append $second
    # => ───┬───┬───
    # =>  # │ a │ b
    # => ───┼───┼───
    # =>  0 │ 1 │ 2
    # =>  1 │ 3 │ 4
    # => ───┴───┴───
    ```

    If the column names are not identical then additionally columns and values will be created as necessary:

    ```nu
    let first = [[a b]; [1 2]]
    let second = [[a b]; [3 4]]
    let third = [[a c]; [3 4]]
    $first | append $second | append $third
    # => ───┬───┬────┬────
    # =>  # │ a │ b  │ c
    # => ───┼───┼────┼────
    # =>  0 │ 1 │  2 │ ❎
    # =>  1 │ 3 │  4 │ ❎
    # =>  2 │ 3 │ ❎ │  4
    # => ───┴───┴────┴────
    ```

    You can also use the `++` operator as an inline replacement for `append`:

    ```nu
    $first ++ $second ++ $third
    # => ───┬───┬────┬────
    # =>  # │ a │ b  │ c
    # => ───┼───┼────┼────
    # =>  0 │ 1 │  2 │ ❎
    # =>  1 │ 3 │  4 │ ❎
    # =>  2 │ 3 │ ❎ │  4
    # => ───┴───┴────┴───
    ```

    ### Merging Tables

    We can use the [`merge`](/commands/docs/merge.md) command to merge two (or more) tables together

    ```nu
    let first = [[a b]; [1 2]]
    let second = [[c d]; [3 4]]
    $first | merge $second
    # => ───┬───┬───┬───┬───
    # =>  # │ a │ b │ c │ d
    # => ───┼───┼───┼───┼───
    # =>  0 │ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │ 4
    # => ───┴───┴───┴───┴───
    ```

    Let's add a third table:

    ```nu
    let third = [[e f]; [5 6]]
    ```

    We could join all three tables together like this:

    ```nu
    $first | merge $second  | merge $third
    # => ───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───
    # =>  # │ a │ b │ c │ d │ e │ f
    # => ───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───
    # =>  0 │ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │ 4 │ 5 │ 6
    # => ───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───
    ```

    Or we could use the [`reduce`](/commands/docs/reduce.md) command to dynamically merge all tables:

    ```nu
    [$first $second $third] | reduce {|elt, acc| $acc | merge $elt }
    # => ───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───
    # =>  # │ a │ b │ c │ d │ e │ f
    # => ───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───
    # =>  0 │ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │ 4 │ 5 │ 6
    # => ───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───┴───
    ```

    ### Adding a new Column

    We can use the [`insert`](/commands/docs/insert.md) command to add a new column to the table. Let's look at an example:

    ```nu
    open rustfmt.toml
    # => ─────────┬──────
    # =>  edition │ 2018
    # => ─────────┴──────
    ```

    Let's add a column called "next_edition" with the value 2021:

    ```nu
    open rustfmt.toml | insert next_edition 2021
    # => ──────────────┬──────
    # =>  edition      │ 2018
    # =>  next_edition │ 2021
    # => ──────────────┴──────
    ```

    This visual may be slightly confusing, because it looks like what we've just done is add a row. In this case, remember: rows have numbers, columns have names. If it still is confusing, note that appending one more row will make the table render as expected:

    ```nu
    open rustfmt.toml | insert next_edition 2021 | append {edition: 2021 next_edition: 2024}
    # => ───┬─────────┬──────────────
    # =>  # │ edition │ next_edition
    # => ───┼─────────┼──────────────
    # =>  0 │    2018 │         2021
    # =>  1 │    2021 │         2024
    # => ───┴─────────┴──────────────
    ```

    Notice that if we open the original file, the contents have stayed the same:

    ```nu
    open rustfmt.toml
    # => ─────────┬──────
    # =>  edition │ 2018
    # => ─────────┴──────
    ```

    Changes in Nu are functional changes, meaning that they work on values themselves rather than trying to cause a permanent change. This lets us do many different types of work in our pipeline until we're ready to write out the result with any changes we'd like if we choose to. Here we could write out the result using the [`save`](/commands/docs/save.md) command:

    ```nu
    open rustfmt.toml | insert next_edition 2021 | save rustfmt2.toml
    open rustfmt2.toml
    # => ──────────────┬──────
    # =>  edition      │ 2018
    # =>  next_edition │ 2021
    # => ──────────────┴──────
    ```

    ### Updating a Column

    In a similar way to the [`insert`](/commands/docs/insert.md) command, we can also use the [`update`](/commands/docs/update.md) command to change the contents of a column to a new value. To see it in action let's open the same file:

    ```nu
    open rustfmt.toml
    # => ─────────┬──────
    # =>  edition │ 2018
    # => ─────────┴──────
    ```

    And now, let's update the edition to point at the next edition we hope to support:

    ```nu
    open rustfmt.toml | update edition 2021
    # => ─────────┬──────
    # =>  edition │ 2021
    # => ─────────┴──────
    ```

    You can also use the [`upsert`](/commands/docs/upsert.md) command to insert or update depending on whether the column already exists.

    ### Moving Columns

    You can use [`move`](/commands/docs/move.md) to move columns in the table. For example, if we wanted to move the "name" column from [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) after the "size" column, we could do:

    ```nu
    ls | move name --after size
    # => ╭────┬──────┬─────────┬───────────────────┬──────────────╮
    # => │ #  │ type │  size   │       name        │   modified   │
    # => ├────┼──────┼─────────┼───────────────────┼──────────────┤
    # => │  0 │ dir  │   256 B │ Applications      │ 3 days ago   │
    # => │  1 │ dir  │   256 B │ Data              │ 2 weeks ago  │
    # => │  2 │ dir  │   448 B │ Desktop           │ 2 hours ago  │
    # => │  3 │ dir  │   192 B │ Disks             │ a week ago   │
    # => │  4 │ dir  │   416 B │ Documents         │ 4 days ago   │
    # => ...
    ```

    ### Renaming Columns

    You can also [`rename`](/commands/docs/rename.md) columns in a table by passing it through the rename command. If we wanted to run [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) and rename the columns, we can use this example:

    ```nu
    ls | rename filename filetype filesize date
    # => ╭────┬───────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────────╮
    # => │ #  │     filename      │ filetype │ filesize │     date     │
    # => ├────┼───────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────────┤
    # => │  0 │ Applications      │ dir      │    256 B │ 3 days ago   │
    # => │  1 │ Data              │ dir      │    256 B │ 2 weeks ago  │
    # => │  2 │ Desktop           │ dir      │    448 B │ 2 hours ago  │
    # => │  3 │ Disks             │ dir      │    192 B │ a week ago   │
    # => │  4 │ Documents         │ dir      │    416 B │ 4 days ago   │
    # => ...
    ```

    ### Rejecting/Deleting Columns

    You can also [`reject`](/commands/docs/reject.md) columns in a table by passing it through the reject command. If we wanted to run [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) and delete the columns, we can use this example:

    ```nu
    ls -l / | reject readonly num_links inode created accessed modified
    # => ╭────┬────────┬─────────┬─────────┬───────────┬──────┬───────┬────────╮
    # => │  # │  name  │  type   │ target  │   mode    │ uid  │ group │  size  │
    # => ├────┼────────┼─────────┼─────────┼───────────┼──────┼───────┼────────┤
    # => │  0 │ /bin   │ symlink │ usr/bin │ rwxrwxrwx │ root │ root  │    7 B │
    # => │  1 │ /boot  │ dir     │         │ rwxr-xr-x │ root │ root  │ 1.0 KB │
    # => │  2 │ /dev   │ dir     │         │ rwxr-xr-x │ root │ root  │ 4.1 KB │
    # => │  3 │ /etc   │ dir     │         │ rwxr-xr-x │ root │ root  │ 3.6 KB │
    # => │  4 │ /home  │ dir     │         │ rwxr-xr-x │ root │ root  │   12 B │
    # => │  5 │ /lib   │ symlink │ usr/lib │ rwxrwxrwx │ root │ root  │    7 B │
    # => │  6 │ /lib64 │ symlink │ usr/lib │ rwxrwxrwx │ root │ root  │    7 B │
    # => │  7 │ /mnt   │ dir     │         │ rwxr-xr-x │ root │ root  │    0 B │
    # => ...
    ```

    ### The # Index Column

    You've noticed that every table, by default, starts with a column with the heading `#`. This column can operate in one of two modes:

    1. Internal #

       - The default mode
       - Nushell provides a 0-based, consecutive index
       - Always corresponds to the cell-path row-number, where `select 0` will return the first item in the list, and `select <n-1>` returns the nth item
       - Is a display of an internal representation only. In other words, it is not accessible by column name. For example, `get index` will not work, nor `get #`

    1. "Index"-Renamed #

       - When a column named "index" is created, either directly or as a side-effect of another command, then this `index` column takes the place of the `#` column in the table display. In the table output, the column header is still `#`, but the _name_ of the column is now `index`.

         Example:

         ```nu
         ls | each { insert index { 1000 }} | first 5
         # => ╭──────┬─────────────────┬──────┬─────────┬──────────────╮
         # => │    # │      name       │ type │  size   │   modified   │
         # => ├──────┼─────────────────┼──────┼─────────┼──────────────┤
         # => │ 1000 │ CNAME           │ file │    15 B │ 9 months ago │
         # => │ 1000 │ CONTRIBUTING.md │ file │ 4.3 KiB │ 9 hours ago  │
         # => │ 1000 │ LICENSE         │ file │ 1.0 KiB │ 9 months ago │
         # => │ 1000 │ README.md       │ file │ 2.2 KiB │ 3 weeks ago  │
         # => │ 1000 │ assets          │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 9 months ago │
         # => ╰──────┴─────────────────┴──────┴─────────┴──────────────╯
         ```

         - If an `index` key is added to each row in the table, then it can be accessed via `select` and `get`:

         ```nu
         ls | each { insert index { 1000 }} | first 5 | select index name
         # => ╭──────┬─────────────────╮
         # => │    # │      name       │
         # => ├──────┼─────────────────┤
         # => │ 1000 │ CNAME           │
         # => │ 1000 │ CONTRIBUTING.md │
         # => │ 1000 │ LICENSE         │
         # => │ 1000 │ README.md       │
         # => │ 1000 │ assets          │
         # => ╰──────┴─────────────────╯
         ```

         - On the other hand, if some rows have an `index` key and others don't, the result is no longer a table; it is a `list<any>` due to the different record types:

           ```nu
           ls | upsert 3.index { "--->" } | first 5
           # => ╭──────┬─────────────────┬──────┬─────────┬──────────────╮
           # => │    # │      name       │ type │  size   │   modified   │
           # => ├──────┼─────────────────┼──────┼─────────┼──────────────┤
           # => │    0 │ CNAME           │ file │    15 B │ 9 months ago │
           # => │    1 │ CONTRIBUTING.md │ file │ 4.3 KiB │ 9 hours ago  │
           # => │    2 │ LICENSE         │ file │ 1.0 KiB │ 9 months ago │
           # => │ ---> │ README.md       │ file │ 2.2 KiB │ 3 weeks ago  │
           # => │    4 │ assets          │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 9 months ago │
           # => ╰──────┴─────────────────┴──────┴─────────┴──────────────╯

           ls | upsert 3.index { "--->" } | first 5 | describe
           # => list<any> (stream)

           ls | upsert 3.index { "--->" } | select index name
           # Error: cannot find column 'index'

           ls | upsert 3.index { "--->" } | select index? name | first 5
           # => ╭──────┬─────────────────╮
           # => │    # │      name       │
           # => ├──────┼─────────────────┤
           # => │      │ CNAME           │
           # => │      │ CONTRIBUTING.md │
           # => │      │ LICENSE         │
           # => │ ---> │ README.md       │
           # => │      │ assets          │
           # => ╰──────┴─────────────────╯
           ```

       - As demonstrated in the example above, any rows (records) in the table without an `index` key will continue to display the internal representation.

    #### Additional Index Examples

    ##### Convert # to Index

    A useful pattern for converting an internal `#` into an index for all rows, while maintaining the original numbering, is:

    ```nu
    ls | enumerate | flatten
    ```

    While the results _look_ the same, the `index` is now decoupled from the internal cell-path. For example:

    ```nu
    ls | enumerate | flatten | sort-by modified | first 5
    # => ╭────┬──────────────┬──────┬─────────┬──────────────╮
    # => │  # │     name     │ type │  size   │   modified   │
    # => ├────┼──────────────┼──────┼─────────┼──────────────┤
    # => │  0 │ CNAME        │ file │    15 B │ 9 months ago │
    # => │  2 │ LICENSE      │ file │ 1.0 KiB │ 9 months ago │
    # => │  4 │ assets       │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 9 months ago │
    # => │ 17 │ lefthook.yml │ file │ 1.1 KiB │ 9 months ago │
    # => │ 24 │ snippets     │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 9 months ago │
    # => ╰────┴──────────────┴──────┴─────────┴──────────────╯

    ls | enumerate | flatten | sort-by modified | select 4
    # => ╭────┬──────────┬──────┬─────────┬──────────────╮
    # => │  # │   name   │ type │  size   │   modified   │
    # => ├────┼──────────┼──────┼─────────┼──────────────┤
    # => │ 24 │ snippets │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 9 months ago │
    # => ╰────┴──────────┴──────┴─────────┴──────────────╯
    ```

    The `sort-by modified` now _also_ sorts the `index` along with the rest of the columns.

    ##### Adding a Row Header

    ```nu
    let table = [
    [additions   deletions   delta ];
    [       10          20     -10 ]
    [       15           5      10 ]
    [        8           6       2 ]]

    let totals_row = ($table | math sum | insert index {"Totals"})
    $table | append $totals_row
    # => ╭────────┬───────────┬───────────┬───────╮
    # => │      # │ additions │ deletions │ delta │
    # => ├────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────┤
    # => │      0 │        10 │        20 │   -10 │
    # => │      1 │        15 │         5 │    10 │
    # => │      2 │         8 │         6 │     2 │
    # => │ Totals │        33 │        31 │     2 │
    # => ╰────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────╯
    ```

    ### The `table` command

    The [`table`](/commands/docs/table.md) command is used to _render_ structured data. This includes:

    - Tables
    - Lists
    - Records
    - Ranges

    Perhaps contrary to initial assumptions, the result of rendering these types is a `string`. For example:

    ```nu
    [ Nagasaki Ghent Cambridge Izmir Graz Lubango ] | table | describe
    # => string (stream)
    ```

    Other data types are passed through the `table` command unchanged.

    With no arguments, the output rendered from the `table` command will often _display_ the same as unrendered form. For example:

    ```nu
    [ Nagasaki Ghent Cambridge Izmir Graz Lubango ]
    # => ╭───┬───────────╮
    # => │ 0 │ Nagasaki  │
    # => │ 1 │ Ghent     │
    # => │ 2 │ Cambridge │
    # => │ 3 │ Izmir     │
    # => │ 4 │ Graz      │
    # => │ 5 │ Lubango   │
    # => ╰───┴───────────╯
    [ Nagasaki Ghent Cambridge Izmir Graz Lubango ] | table
    # => ╭───┬───────────╮
    # => │ 0 │ Nagasaki  │
    # => │ 1 │ Ghent     │
    # => │ 2 │ Cambridge │
    # => │ 3 │ Izmir     │
    # => │ 4 │ Graz      │
    # => │ 5 │ Lubango   │
    # => ╰───┴───────────╯
    ```

    This can be useful when you need to store the rendered view of structured data as a string. For example, to remove all ANSI formatting (colors) from a table:

    ```nu
    ls | table | ansi strip
    ```

    The `table` command also has multiple options for _changing_ the rendering of a table, such as:

    # Design Notes

    This chapter intends to give more in-depth overview of certain aspects of Nushell's design. The topics are not necessary for a basic usage, but reading them will help you understand how Nushell works and why.

    We intend to expand this chapter in the future. If there is some topic that you find confusing and hard to understand, let us know. It might be a good candidate for a page here.

    [How Nushell Code Gets Run](how_nushell_code_gets_run.md) explains what happens when you run Nushell source code. It explains how Nushell is in many ways closer to classic compiled languages, like C or Rust, than to other shells and dynamic languages and hopefully clears some confusion that stems from that.

    ## Setting Nu as login shell (Linux, BSD & macOS)

    ::: warning
    Nu is not intended to be POSIX compliant.
    Be aware that some programs on your system (or their documentation) might assume that your login shell is [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compatible.
    Breaking that assumption can lead to unexpected issues. See [Configuration - Login Shell](./configuration.md#configuring-nu-as-a-login-shell) for more details.
    :::

    To set the login shell you can use the [`chsh`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chsh) command.
    Some Linux distributions have a list of valid shells located in `/etc/shells` and will disallow changing the shell until Nu is in the whitelist.
    You may see an error similar to the one below if you haven't updated the `shells` file:

    @[code](@snippets/installation/chsh_invalid_shell_error.sh)

    You can add Nu to the list of allowed shells by appending your Nu binary to the `shells` file.
    The path to add can be found with the command `which nu`, usually it is `$HOME/.cargo/bin/nu`.

    Documentation text:

    # `explore`

    Explore is a table pager, just like `less` but for table structured data.

    ## Signature

    `> explore --head --index --reverse --peek`

    ### Parameters

     -  `--head {bool}`: Show or hide column headers (default true)
     -  `--index, -i`: Show row indexes when viewing a list
     -  `--tail, -t`: Start with the viewport scrolled to the bottom
     -  `--peek, -p`: When quitting, output the value of the cell the cursor was on

    ## Get Started

    ```nu
    ls | explore -i
    ```

    ![explore-ls-png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20165848/207849604-421312e3-537f-4b2e-b83e-f1f83f2a79d5.png)

    So the main point of [`explore`](/commands/docs/explore.md) is `:table` (Which you see on the above screenshot).

    You can interact with it via `<Left>`, `<Right>`, `<Up>`, `<Down>` _arrow keys_. It also supports the `Vim` keybindings `<h>`, `<j>`, `<k>`, and `<l>`, `<Ctrl-f>` and `<Ctrl-b>`, and it supports the `Emacs` keybindings `<Ctrl-v>`, `<Alt-v>`, `<Ctrl-p>`, and `<Ctrl-n>`.

    You can inspect a underlying values by entering into cursor mode. You can press either `<i>` or `<Enter>` to do so.
    Then using _arrow keys_ you can choose a necessary cell.
    And you'll be able to see it's underlying structure.

    You can obtain more information about the various aspects of it by `:help`.

    ## Commands

    [`explore`](/commands/docs/explore.md) has a list of built in commands you can use. Commands are run through pressing `<:>` and then a command name.

    To find out the comprehensive list of commands you can type `:help`.

    ## Config

    You can configure many things (including styles and colors), via config.
    You can find an example configuration in [`default-config.nu`](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-utils/src/default_files/default_config.nu).

    ## Examples

    ### Peeking a Value

    ```nu
    $nu | explore --peek
    ```

    ![explore-peek-gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20165848/207854897-35cb7b1d-7f7d-4ae2-9ec8-df19ac04ac99.gif)

    ### `:try` Command

    There's an interactive environment which you can use to navigate through data using `nu`.

    ![explore-try-gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20165848/208159049-0954c327-9cdf-4cb3-a6e9-e3ba86fde55c.gif)

    #### Keeping the chosen value by `$nu`

    Remember you can combine it with `--peek`.

    ![explore-try-nu-gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20165848/208161203-96b51209-726d-449a-959a-48b205c6f55a.gif)

    ## Nushell Commands Output _Data_

    The easiest way to see what Nu can do is to start with some examples, so let's dive in.

    The first thing you'll notice when you run a command like [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) is that instead of a block of text coming back, you get a structured table.

    ```nu:no-line-numbers
    ls
    # => ╭────┬─────────────────────┬──────┬───────────┬──────────────╮
    # => │  # │        name         │ type │   size    │   modified   │
    # => ├────┼─────────────────────┼──────┼───────────┼──────────────┤
    # => │  0 │ CITATION.cff        │ file │     812 B │ 2 months ago │
    # => │  1 │ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md  │ file │   3.4 KiB │ 9 months ago │
    # => │  2 │ CONTRIBUTING.md     │ file │  11.0 KiB │ 5 months ago │
    # => │  3 │ Cargo.lock          │ file │ 194.9 KiB │ 15 hours ago │
    # => │  4 │ Cargo.toml          │ file │   9.2 KiB │ 15 hours ago │
    # => │  5 │ Cross.toml          │ file │     666 B │ 6 months ago │
    # => │  6 │ LICENSE             │ file │   1.1 KiB │ 9 months ago │
    # => │  7 │ README.md           │ file │  12.0 KiB │ 15 hours ago │
    # => ...
    ```

    This table does more than just format the output nicely. Like a spreadsheet, it allows us to work with the data _interactively_.

    ## Acting on Data

    Next, let's sort this table by each file's size. To do this, we'll take the output from [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) and feed it into a command that can sort tables based on the _values_ in a column.

    ```nu:no-line-numbers
    ls | sort-by size | reverse
    # => ╭───┬─────────────────┬──────┬───────────┬──────────────╮
    # => │ # │      name       │ type │   size    │   modified   │
    # => ├───┼─────────────────┼──────┼───────────┼──────────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ Cargo.lock      │ file │ 194.9 KiB │ 15 hours ago │
    # => │ 1 │ toolkit.nu      │ file │  20.0 KiB │ 15 hours ago │
    # => │ 2 │ README.md       │ file │  12.0 KiB │ 15 hours ago │
    # => │ 3 │ CONTRIBUTING.md │ file │  11.0 KiB │ 5 months ago │
    # => │ 4 │ ...             │ ...  │ ...       │ ...          │
    # => │ 5 │ LICENSE         │ file │   1.1 KiB │ 9 months ago │
    # => │ 6 │ CITATION.cff    │ file │     812 B │ 2 months ago │
    # => │ 7 │ Cross.toml      │ file │     666 B │ 6 months ago │
    # => │ 8 │ typos.toml      │ file │     513 B │ 2 months ago │
    # => ╰───┴─────────────────┴──────┴───────────┴──────────────╯
    ```

    Notice that we didn't pass commandline arguments or switches to [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md). Instead, we used Nushell's built-in [`sort-by`](/commands/docs/sort-by.md) command to sort the _output_ of the `ls` command. Then, to see the largest files on top, we used [`reverse`](/commands/docs/reverse.md) on the _output_ of `sort-by`.

    ::: tip Cool!
    If you compare the sort order closely, you might realize that the data isn't sorted alphabetically. It's not even sorted by the _numerical_ values. Instead, since the `size` column is a [`filesize` type](./types_of_data.md#file-sizes), Nushell knows that `1.1 KiB` (kibibytes) is larger than `812 B` (bytes).

    Documentation text:

    # Finding Data Using the `where` Command

    Nu provides many commands that can operate on the structured output of the previous command. These are usually categorized as "Filters" in Nushell.

    For example, we can use [`where`](/commands/docs/where.md) to filter the contents of the table so that it only shows files over 10 kilobytes:

    ```nu
    ls | where size > 10kb
    # => ╭───┬─────────────────┬──────┬───────────┬───────────────╮
    # => │ # │      name       │ type │   size    │   modified    │

    # => ╰───┴─────────────────┴──────┴───────────┴───────────────╯
    ```

    ## More Than Just Directories

    Of course, this isn't limited to the `ls` command. Nushell follows the Unix philosophy where each command does one thing well and you can typically expect the output of one command to become the input of another. This allows us to mix-and-match commands in many different combinations.

    Let's look at a different command:

    ```nu:no-line-numbers
    ps
    # => ╭───┬──────┬──────┬───────────────┬──────────┬──────┬───────────┬─────────╮
    # => │ # │ pid  │ ppid │     name      │  status  │ cpu  │    mem    │ virtual │

    # => │ 1 │    8 │    1 │ init          │ Sleeping │ 0.00 │ 124.0 KiB │ 2.3 MiB │
    # => │ 2 │ 6565 │    1 │ SessionLeader │ Sleeping │ 0.00 │ 108.0 KiB │ 2.2 MiB │
    # => │ 3 │ 6566 │ 6565 │ Relay(6567)   │ Sleeping │ 0.00 │ 116.0 KiB │ 2.2 MiB │

    # => ╰───┴──────┴──────┴───────────────┴──────────┴──────┴───────────┴─────────╯
    ```

    You may be familiar with the Linux/Unix `ps` command. It provides a list of all of the current processes running in the system along with their current status. As with `ls`, Nushell provides a cross-platform, built-in [`ps` command](/commands/docs/ps.md) that returns its results as structured data.

    ::: note
    The traditional Unix `ps` only shows the current process and its parents by default. Nushell's implementation shows all of the processes on the system by default.

    Normally, running `ps` in Nushell uses its **_internal_**, cross-platform command. However, it is still possible to run the **_external_**, system-dependent version on Unix/Linux platforms by prefacing it with the _caret sigil_. For example:

    ```nu
    ^ps aux  # run the Unix ps command with all processes in user-oriented form
    ```

    See [Running External System Commands](./running_externals.md) for more details.
    :::

    What if we wanted to just show the processes that are actively running? As with `ls` above, we can also work with the table that `ps` _outputs_:

    ```nu
    ps | where status == Running
    # => ╭───┬──────┬──────┬──────┬─────────┬──────┬──────────┬─────────╮
    # => │ # │ pid  │ ppid │ name │ status  │ cpu  │   mem    │ virtual │
    # => ├───┼──────┼──────┼──────┼─────────┼──────┼──────────┼─────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ 6585 │ 6584 │ nu   │ Running │ 0.00 │ 31.9 MiB │ 1.2 GiB │
    # => ╰───┴──────┴──────┴──────┴─────────┴──────┴──────────┴─────────╯
    ```

    ::: tip
    Remember above, where the `size` column from the `ls` command was a `filesize`? Here, `status` is really just a string, and you can use all the normal string operations and commands with it, including (as above) the `==` comparison.

    You can examine the types for the table's columns using:

    ```nu
    ps | describe
    # => table<pid: int, ppid: int, name: string, status: string, cpu: float, mem: filesize, virtual: filesize> (stream)
    ```

    The [`describe` command](/commands/docs/describe.md) can be used to display the output type of any command or expression.

    :::

    ## Command Arguments in a Pipeline

    Sometimes, a command takes an _argument_ instead of pipeline _input_. For this scenario, Nushell provides the [`$in` variable](./pipelines.md#pipeline-input-and-the-special-in-variable) that let's you use the previous command's output in variable-form. For example:

    ```nu:line-numbers
    ls
    | sort-by size
    | reverse
    | first
    | get name
    | cp $in ~
    ```

    ::: tip Nushell Design Note
    Whenever possible, Nushell commands are designed to act on pipeline _input_. However, some commands, like `cp` in this example, have two (or more)
    arguments with different meanings. In this case, `cp` needs to know both the path to _copy_ as well as the _target_ path. As a result, this command is
    more ergonomic with two _positional parameters_.
    :::

    ::: tip
    Nushell commands can extend across multiple lines for readability. The above is the same as:

    ```nu
    ls | sort-by size | reverse | first | get name | cp $in ~
    ```

    See Also: [Multi-line Editing](./line_editor.md#multi-line-editing)
    :::

    The first three lines are the same commands we used in the second example above, so let's examine the last three:

    4. The [`first` command](/commands/docs/first.md) simply returns the first value from the table. In this case, that means the file with the largest size. That's the `Cargo.lock` file if using the directory listing from the second example above. This "file" is a [`record`](./types_of_data.md#records) from the table which still contains its `name`, `type`, `size`, and `modified` columns/fields.
    5. `get name` returns the _value_ of the `name` field from the previous command, so `"Cargo.lock"` (a string). This is also a simple example of a [`cell-path`](./types_of_data.md#cell-paths) that can be used to navigate and isolate structured data.
    6. The last line uses the `$in` variable to reference the output of line 5. The result is a command that says _"Copy 'Cargo.lock' to the home directory"_

    ::: tip
    [`get`](/commands/docs/get.md) and its counterpart [`select`](/commands/docs/select.md) are two of the most used filters in Nushell, but it might not be easy to
    spot the difference between them at first glance. When you're ready to start using them more extensively, see [Using `get` and `select`](./navigating_structured_data.md#using-get-and-select) for a guide.

    ## Getting Help

    Nushell provides an extensive, in-shell Help system. For example

    ```nu
    # help <command>
    help ls
    # Or
    ls --help
    # Also
    help operators
    help escapes
    ```

    ::: tip Cool!
    Press the <kbd>F1</kbd> key to access the Help [menu](./line_editor.md#menus). Search for the `ps` command here, but _don't press <kbd>Enter</kbd> just yet_!

    Instead, press the <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> key, and notice that you are scrolling through the Examples section. Highlight an example, _then_ press <kbd>Enter</kbd> and
    the example will be entered at the commandline, ready to run!

    This can be a great way to explore and learn about the extensive set of Nushell commands.
    :::

    The Help system also has a "search" feature:

    ```nu
    help --find filesize
    # or
    help -f filesize
    ```

    It may not surprise you by now that the Help system itself is based on structured data! Notice that the output of `help -f filesize` is a table.

    The Help for each command is stored as a record with the:

    - Name
    - Category
    - Type (built-in, plugin, custom)
    - Parameters it accepts
    - Signatures showing what types of data it can accept as well as output
    - And more

    You can view _all_ commands (other than externals) as a single large table using:

    ```nu
    help commands
    ```

    ::: tip
    Notice that the `params` and `input_output` columns of the output above are _nested_ tables. Nushell allows [arbitrarily nested data structures](./navigating_structured_data.md#background).
    :::

    ## `explore`'ing from Here

    That `help commands` output is quite long. You could send it to a pager like `less` or `bat`, but Nushell includes a built-in `explore` command that lets you not only scroll, but also telescope-in to nested data. Try:

    ```nu
    help commands | explore
    ```

    Then press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to access the data itself. Use the arrow keys to scroll to the `cp` command, and over to the `params` column. Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> again to
    telescope in to the complete list of parameters available to the `cp` command.

    ::: note
    Pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> one time returns from Scroll-mode to the View; Pressing it a second time returns to the previous view (or exits, if already at the top view level).

    You can, of course, use the `explore` command on _any_ structured data in Nushell. This might include JSON data coming from a Web API, a spreadsheet or CSV file, YAML, or anything that can be represented as structured data in Nushell.

    Try `$env.config | explore` for fun!

    # Nu as a Shell

    The [Nu Fundamentals](nu_fundamentals.md) and [Programming in Nu](programming_in_nu.md) chapter focused mostly on the language aspects of Nushell.
    This chapter sheds the light on the parts of Nushell that are related to the Nushell interpreter (the Nushell [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)).
    Some of the concepts are directly a part of the Nushell programming language (such as environment variables) while others are implemented purely to enhance the interactive experience (such as hooks) and thus are not present when, for example, running a script.

    Many parameters of Nushell can be [configured](configuration.md).
    The config itself is stored as an environment variable.
    Furthermore, Nushell has several different configuration files that are run on startup where you can put custom commands, aliases, etc.

    A big feature of any shell are [environment variables](environment.md).
    In Nushell, environment variables are scoped and can have any type supported by Nushell.
    This brings in some additional design considerations so please refer to the linked section for more details.

    The other sections explain how to work with [stdout, stderr and exit codes](stdout_stderr_exit_codes.md), how to [run an external command when there is a built-in with the same name](./running_externals.md), and how to [configure 3rd party prompts](3rdpartyprompts.md) to work with Nushell.

    An interesting feature of Nushell is the [Directory Stack](directory_stack.md) which let you work in multiple directories simultaneously.

    Nushell also has its own line editor [Reedline](line_editor.md).
    With Nushell's config, it is possible to configure some of the Reedline's features, such as the prompt, keybindings, history, or menus.

    It is also possible to define [custom signatures for external commands](externs.md) which lets you define [custom completions](custom_completions.md) for them (the custom completions also work for Nushell custom commands).

    [Coloring and Theming in Nu](coloring_and_theming.md) goes into more detail about how to configure Nushell's appearance.

    If you want to schedule some commands to run in the background, [Background jobs](background_jobs.md) provides simple guidelines for you to follow.

    Finally, [hooks](hooks.md) allow you to insert fragments of Nushell code to run at certain events.
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of using the Nushell REPL and its associated features like hooks, environment variables, and directory stack?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user configure the Reedline line editor in Nushell to customize the prompt and keybindings?
  documentationQuestion3: What are common use cases for defining custom signatures and completions for external commands in Nushell?

    # Nu Map from Imperative Languages

    The idea behind this table is to help you understand how Nu built-ins and plugins relate to imperative languages. We've tried to produce a map of programming-relevant Nu commands and what their equivalents are in other languages. Contributions are welcome.

    Note: this table assumes Nu 0.94 or later.
  documentationQuestion1: What is the main purpose of the "Nu Map from Imperative Languages" table as described in the documentation?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user find the equivalent of a specific imperative language command in Nu according to the table?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the recommended approach for contributing new entries to the "Nu Map from Imperative Languages" table?

Sometimes, though, we want to have more precise control over what environment variables an application sees.\n\nYou can see the current environment variables in the $env variable:\n\n```nu\n$env | table -e\n# => ╭──────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────╮\n# => │                                  │ ╭──────┬────────────────────────────────╮ │\n# => │ ENV_CONVERSIONS                  │ │      │ ╭─────────────┬──────────────╮ │ │\n# => │                                  │ │ PATH │ │ from_string │ <Closure 32> │ │ │\n# => │                                  │ │      │ │ to_string   │ <Closure 34> │ │ │\n# => │                                  │ │      │ ╰─────────────┴──────────────╯ │ │\n# => │                                  │ │      │ ╭─────────────┬──────────────╮ │ │\n# => │                                  │ │ Path │ │ from_string │ <Closure 36> │ │ │\n# => │                                  │ │      │ │ to_string   │ <Closure 38> │ │ │\n# => │                                  │ │      │ ╰─────────────┴──────────────╯ │ │\n# => │                                  │ ╰──────┴────────────────────────────────╯ │\n# => │ HOME                             │ /Users/jelle                              │\n# => │ LSCOLORS                         │ GxFxCxDxBxegedabagaced                    │\n# => | ...                              | ...                                       |\n# => ╰──────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\nIn Nushell, environment variables can be any value and have any type. You can see the type of an env variable with the describe command, for example: `$env.PROMPT_COMMAND | describe`.\n\nTo send environment variables to external applications, the values will need to be converted to strings. See [Environment variable conversions](#environment-variable-conversions) on how this works.\n\nThe environment is initially created from the Nu [configuration files](configuration.md) and from the environment that Nu is run inside of.\n\n## Setting Environment Variables\n\nThere are several ways to set an environment variable:\n\n### $env.VAR assignment\n\nUsing the `$env.VAR = \"val\"` is the most straightforward method\n\n```nu\n$env.FOO = 'BAR'\n```\n\nSo, if you want to extend the Windows `Path` variable, for example, you could do that as follows.\n\n```nu\n$env.Path = ($env.Path | prepend 'C:\\path\\you\\want\\to\\add')\n```\n\nHere we've prepended our folder to the existing folders in the Path, so it will have the highest priority.\nIf you want to give it the lowest priority instead, you can use the [`append`](/commands/docs/append.md) command.\n\n### [`load-env`](/commands/docs/load-env.md)\n\nIf you have more than one environment variable you'd like to set, you can use [`load-env`](/commands/docs/load-env.md) to create a table of name/value pairs and load multiple variables at the same time:\n\n```nu\nload-env { \"BOB\": \"FOO\", \"JAY\": \"BAR\" }\n```\n\n### One-shot Environment Variables\n\nThese are defined to be active only temporarily for a duration of executing a code block.\nSee [Single-use environment variables](environment.md#single-use-environment-variables) for details.\n\n### Calling a Command Defined with [`def --env`](/commands/docs/def.md)\n\nSee [Defining environment from custom commands](custom_commands.md#changing-the-environment-in-a-custom-command) for details.\n\n### Using Module's Exports\n\nSee [Modules](modules.md) for details.\n\n## Reading Environment Variables\n\nIndividual environment variables are fields of a record that is stored in the `$env` variable and can be read with `$env.VARIABLE`:\n\n```nu\n$env.FOO\n# => BAR\n```\n\nSometimes, you may want to access an environmental variable which might be unset. Consider using the [question mark operator](types_of_data.md#optional-cell-paths) to avoid an error:\n\n```nu\n$env.FOO | describe\n# => Error: nu::shell::column_not_found\n# => \n# =>   × Cannot find column\n# =>    ╭─[entry #1:1:1]\n# =>  1 │ $env.FOO\n# =>    · ──┬─ ─┬─\n# =>    ·   │   ╰── cannot find column 'FOO'\n# =>    ·   ╰── value originates here\n# =>    ╰────\n\n$env.FOO? | describe\n# => nothing\n\n$env.FOO? | default \"BAR\"\n# => BAR\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can check for the presence of an environmental variable with `in`:\n\n```nu\n$env.FOO\n# => BAR\n\nif \"FOO\" in $env {\n    echo $env.FOO\n}\n# => BAR\n```\n\n### Case sensitivity\n\nNushell's `$env` is case-insensitive, regardless of the OS. Although `$env` behaves mostly like a record, it is special in that it ignores the case when reading or updating. This means, for example, you can use any of `$env.PATH`, `$env.Path`, or `$env.path`, and they all work the same on any OS.\n\nIf you want to read `$env` in a case-sensitive manner, use `$env | get --sensitive`.\n\n## Scoping\n\nWhen you set an environment variable, it will be available only in the current scope (the block you're in and any block inside of it).\n\nHere is a small example to demonstrate the environment scoping:\n\n```nu\n$env.FOO = \"BAR\"\ndo {\n    $env.FOO = \"BAZ\"\n    $env.FOO == \"BAZ\"\n}\n# => true\n$env.FOO == \"BAR\"\n# => true\n```\n\nSee also: [Changing the Environment in a Custom Command](./custom_commands.html#changing-the-environment-in-a-custom-command).\n\n## Changing the Directory\n\nA common task in a shell is to change the directory using the [`cd`](/commands/docs/cd.md) command. In Nushell, calling [`cd`](/commands/docs/cd.md) is equivalent to setting the `PWD` environment variable. Therefore, it follows the same rules as other environment variables (for example, scoping).\n\n## Single-use Environment Variables\n\nA common shorthand to set an environment variable once is available, inspired by Bash and others:\n\n```nu\nFOO=BAR $env.FOO\n# => BAR\n```\n\nYou can also use [`with-env`](/commands/docs/with-env.md) to do the same thing more explicitly:\n\n```nu\nwith-env { FOO: BAR } { $env.FOO }\n# => BAR\n```\n\nThe [`with-env`](/commands/docs/with-env.md) command will temporarily set the environment variable to the value given (here: the variable \"FOO\" is given the value \"BAR\"). Once this is done, the [block](types_of_data.md#blocks) will run with this new environment variable set.\n\n## Permanent Environment Variables\n\nYou can also set environment variables at startup so they are available for the duration of Nushell running. To do this, set an environment variable inside [the Nu configuration file](configuration.md).\n\nFor example:\n\n```nu\n# In config.nu\n$env.FOO = 'BAR'\n```\n\n## Environment Variable Conversions\n\nYou can set the `ENV_CONVERSIONS` environment variable to convert other environment variables between a string and a value.\nFor example, the [default environment config](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-utils/src/default_files/default_env.nu) includes conversion of PATH (and Path used on Windows) environment variables from a string to a list.\nAfter both `env.nu` and `config.nu` are loaded, any existing environment variable specified inside `ENV_CONVERSIONS` will be translated according to its `from_string` field into a value of any type.\nExternal tools require environment variables to be strings, therefore, any non-string environment variable needs to be converted first.\nThe conversion of value -> string is set by the `to_string` field of `ENV_CONVERSIONS` and is done every time an external command is run.\n\nLet's illustrate the conversions with an example.\nPut the following in your config.nu:\n\n```nu\n$env.ENV_CONVERSIONS = {\n    # ... you might have Path and PATH already there, add:\n    FOO : {\n        from_string: { |s| $s | split row '-' }\n        to_string: { |v| $v | str join '-' }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, within a Nushell instance:\n\n```nu\nwith-env { FOO : 'a-b-c' } { nu }  # runs Nushell with FOO env. var. set to 'a-b-c'\n\n$env.FOO\n# =>   0   a\n# =>   1   b\n# =>   2   c\n```\n\nYou can see the `$env.FOO` is now a list in a new Nushell instance with the updated config.\nYou can also test the conversion manually by\n\n```nu\ndo $env.ENV_CONVERSIONS.FOO.from_string 'a-b-c'\n```\n\nNow, to test the conversion list -> string, run:\n\n```nu\nnu -c '$env.FOO'\n# => a-b-c\n```\n\nBecause `nu` is an external program, Nushell translated the `[ a b c ]` list according to `ENV_CONVERSIONS.FOO.to_string` and passed it to the `nu` process.\nRunning commands with `nu -c` does not load the config file, therefore the env conversion for `FOO` is missing and it is displayed as a plain string -- this way we can verify the translation was successful.\nYou can also run this step manually by `do $env.ENV_CONVERSIONS.FOO.to_string [a b c]`\n\n_(Important! The environment conversion string -> value happens **after** the env.nu and config.nu are evaluated. All environment variables in env.nu and config.nu are still strings unless you set them manually to some other values.)_\n\n## Removing Environment Variables\n\nYou can remove an environment variable only if it was set in the current scope via [`hide-env`](/commands/docs/hide-env.md):\n\n```nu\n$env.FOO = 'BAR'\n# => ...\nhide-env FOO\n```\n\nThe hiding is also scoped which both allows you to remove an environment variable temporarily and prevents you from modifying a parent environment from within a child scope:\n\n```nu\n$env.FOO = 'BAR'\ndo {\n  hide-env FOO\n  # $env.FOO does not exist\n}\n$env.FOO\n# => BAR\n```"

    Documentation text:

    # Working with Records

    :::tip
    Records are roughly equivalent to the individual rows of a table. You can think of a record as essentially being a "one-row table". Thus, most commands which operate on a table row _also_ operates on a record. For instance, [`update`](/commands/docs/update.md) can be used with records:

    ```nu
    let my_record = {
     name: "Sam"
     age: 30
     }
    $my_record | update age { $in + 1 }
    # => ╭──────┬─────╮
    # => │ name │ Sam │
    # => │ age  │ 31  │
    # => ╰──────┴─────╯
    ```

    Note that the `my_record` [variable is immutable](variables.md). The updated record resulting from the [pipeline](pipelines.md) is printed as seen in the code block. The `my_record` variable still holds the original value - `$my_record.age` is still `30`.

    :::

    ## Creating records

    A record is a collection of zero or more key-value pair mappings. It is similar to a JSON object, and can be created using the same syntax:

    ```nu
    # Nushell
    { "apples": 543, "bananas": 411, "oranges": 0 }
    # => ╭─────────┬─────╮
    # => │ apples  │ 543 │
    # => │ bananas │ 411 │
    # => │ oranges │ 0   │
    # => ╰─────────┴─────╯
    # JSON
    '{ "apples": 543, "bananas": 411, "oranges": 0 }' | from json
    # => ╭─────────┬─────╮
    # => │ apples  │ 543 │
    # => │ bananas │ 411 │
    # => │ oranges │ 0   │
    # => ╰─────────┴─────╯
    ```

    In Nushell, the key-value pairs of a record can also be separated using spaces or line-breaks.

    ::: tip
    As records can have many fields, they are, by default, displayed vertically rather than left-to-right. To display a record left-to-right, convert it to a nuon. For example:

    ```nu
      {
        name: "Sam"
        rank: 10
      } | to nuon
      # =>   {name: Sam, rank: 10}
    ```

    :::

    ## Updating Records

    As with lists, you can [`insert`](/commands/docs/insert.md) values in records. For example, let's add some pears:

    ```nu
    { "apples": 543, "bananas": 411, "oranges": 0 }
    | insert pears { 21 }
    # => ╭─────────┬─────╮
    # => │ apples  │ 543 │
    # => │ bananas │ 411 │
    # => │ oranges │ 0   │
    # => │ pears   │ 21  │
    # => ╰─────────┴─────╯
    ```

    You can also [`update`](/commands/docs/update.md) values:

    ```nu
    { "apples": 543, "bananas": 411, "oranges": 0 }
    | update oranges { 100 }
    # => ╭─────────┬─────╮
    # => │ apples  │ 543 │
    # => │ bananas │ 411 │
    # => │ oranges │ 100 │
    # => ╰─────────┴─────╯
    ```

    To make a copy of a record with new fields, you can either:

    - Use the [`merge`](/commands/docs/merge.md) command:

      ```nu
      let first_record = { name: "Sam", rank: 10 }
      $first_record | merge { title: "Mayor" }
      # =>   ╭───────┬───────╮
      # =>   │ name  │ Sam   │
      # =>   │ rank  │ 10    │
      # =>   │ title │ Mayor │
      # =>   ╰───────┴───────╯
      ```

    - Use the [spread operator](/book/operators#spread-operator) (`...`) to expand the first record inside a new record:

      ```nu
      let first_record = { name: "Sam", rank: 10 }
      {
        ...$first_record
        title: "Mayor"
      }
      # =>   ╭───────┬───────╮
      # =>   │ name  │ Sam   │
      # =>   │ rank  │ 10    │
      # =>   │ title │ Mayor │
      # =>   ╰───────┴───────╯
      ```

    ## Iterating over a Record

    You can iterate over the key-value pairs of a record by first transposing it into a table:

    ```nu
    { "apples": 543, "bananas": 411, "oranges": 0 }
    | transpose fruit count
    | each {|f| $"We have ($f.count) ($f.fruit)" }
    # => ╭───┬─────────────────────╮
    # => │ 0 │ We have 543 apples  │
    # => │ 1 │ We have 411 bananas │
    # => │ 2 │ We have 0 oranges   │
    # => ╰───┴─────────────────────╯
    ```

    ## Accessing Record Values

    See [Navigating and Accessing Structured Data](/book/navigating_structured_data.md) for an in-depth explanation of how to access record values (and other structured data).

    ## Other Record Commands

    See [Working with Tables](./working_with_tables.md) - Remember, commands that operate on table rows will usually operate the same way on records.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `custom_completions page of the documentation provided by Nushell`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# Custom Completions\n\nCustom completions allow you to mix together two features of Nushell: custom commands and completions. With them, you're able to create commands that handle the completions for positional parameters and flag parameters. These custom completions work both for [custom commands](custom_commands.md) and [known external, or `extern`, commands](externs.md).\n\nA completion is defined in two steps:\n\n- Define a completion command (a.k.a. completer) that returns the possible values to suggest\n- Attach the completer to the type annotation (shape) of another command's argument using `<shape>@<completer>`\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```nu\n# Completion command\ndef animals [] { [\"cat\", \"dog\", \"eel\" ] }\n# Command to be completed\ndef my-command [animal: string@animals] { print $animal }\nmy-command\n# => cat                 dog                 eel\n```\n\nThe first line defines a custom command which returns a list of three different animals. These are the possible values for the completion.\n\n::: tip\nTo suppress completions for an argument (for example, an `int` that can accept any integer), define a completer that returns an empty list (`[ ]`).\n:::\n\nIn the second line, `string@animals` tells Nushell two things—the shape of the argument for type-checking and the completer which will suggest possible values for the argument.\n\nThe third line is demonstration of the completion. Type the name of the custom command `my-command`, followed by a space, and then the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key. This displays a menu with the possible completions. Custom completions work the same as other completions in the system, allowing you to type `e` followed by the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to complete \"eel\" automatically.\n\n::: tip\nWhen the completion menu is displayed, the prompt changes to include the `|` character by default. To change the prompt marker, modify the `marker` value of the record, where the `name` key is `completion_menu`, in the `$env.config.menus` list.  See also [the completion menu configuration](/book/line_editor.md#completion-menu).\n:::\n\n::: tip\nTo fall back to Nushell's built-in file completions, return `null` rather than a list of suggestions.\n:::\n\n## Options for Custom Completions\n\nIf you want to choose how your completions are filtered and sorted, you can also return a record rather than a list. The list of completion suggestions should be under the `completions` key of this record. Optionally, it can also have, under the `options` key, a record containing the following optional settings:\n\n- `sort` - Set this to `false` to stop Nushell from sorting your completions. By default, this is `true`, and completions are sorted according to `$env.config.completions.sort`.\n- `case_sensitive` - Set to `true` for the custom completions to be matched case sensitively, `false` otherwise. Used for overriding `$env.config.completions.case_sensitive`.\n- `completion_algorithm` - Set this to either `prefix` or `fuzzy` to choose how your completions are matched against the typed text. Used for overriding `$env.config.completions.algorithm`.\n- `positional` - When prefix matching is used, setting this to `false` will use substring matching instead. `true` by default.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how to set these options:\n\n```nu\ndef animals [] {\n    {\n        options: {\n            case_sensitive: false,\n            completion_algorithm: prefix,\n            positional: false,\n            sort: false,\n        },\n        completions: [cat, rat, bat]\n    }\n}\ndef my-command [animal: string@animals] { print $animal }\n```\n\nNow, if you try to complete `A`, you get the following completions:\n\n```nu\n>| my-command A\ncat                 rat                 bat\n```\n\nBecause we made matching case-insensitive and used `positional: false`, Nushell will find the substring \"a\" in all of the completion suggestions. Additionally, because we set `sort: false`, the completions will be left in their original order. This is useful if your completions are already sorted in a particular order unrelated to their text (e.g. by date).\n\n## Modules and Custom Completions\n\nSince completion commands aren't meant to be called directly, it's common to define them in modules.\n\nExtending the above example with a module:\n\n```nu\nmodule commands {\n    def animals [] {\n        [\"cat\", \"dog\", \"eel\" ]\n    }\n\n    export def my-command [animal: string@animals] {\n        print $animal\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this module, only the the custom command `my-command` is exported. The `animals` completion is not exported. This allows users of this module to call the command, and even use the custom completion logic, without having access to the completion command itself. This results in a cleaner and more maintainable API.\n\n::: tip\nCompleters are attached to custom commands using `@` at parse time. This means that, in order for a change to the completion command to take effect, the public custom command must be reparsed as well. Importing a module satisfies both of these requirements at the same time with a single `use` statement.\n:::\n\n## Context Aware Custom Completions\n\nIt is possible to pass the context to the completion command. This is useful in situations where it is necessary to know previous arguments or flags to generate accurate completions.\n\nApplying this concept to the previous example:\n\n```nu\nmodule commands {\n    def animals [] {\n        [\"cat\", \"dog\", \"eel\" ]\n    }\n\n    def animal-names [context: string] {\n        match ($context | split words | last) {\n            cat => [\"Missy\", \"Phoebe\"]\n            dog => [\"Lulu\", \"Enzo\"]\n            eel => [\"Eww\", \"Slippy\"]\n        }\n    }\n\n    export def my-command [\n        animal: string@animals\n        name: string@animal-names\n    ] {\n        print $\"The ($animal) is named ($name).\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere, the command `animal-names` returns the appropriate list of names. `$context` is a string where the value is the command-line that has been typed so far.\n\n```nu\n>| my-command\ncat                 dog                 eel\n>| my-command dog\nLulu                Enzo\n>my-command dog enzo\nThe dog is named Enzo\n```\n\nOn the second line, after pressing the <kbd>tab</kbd> key, the argument `\"my-command dog\"` is passed to the `animal-names` completer as context.\n\n::: tip\nCompleters can also obtain the current cursor position on the command-line using:\n\n```nu\ndef completer [context:string, position:int] {}\n```\n\n:::\n\n## Custom Completion and [`extern`](/commands/docs/extern.md)\n\nA powerful combination is adding custom completions to [known `extern` commands](externs.md). These work the same way as adding a custom completion to a custom command: by creating the custom completion and then attaching it with a `@` to the type of one of the positional or flag arguments of the `extern`.\n\nIf you look closely at the examples in the default config, you'll see this:\n\n```nu\nexport extern \"git push\" [\n    remote?: string@\"nu-complete git remotes\",  # the name of the remote\n    refspec?: string@\"nu-complete git branches\" # the branch / refspec\n    ...\n]\n```\n\nCustom completions will serve the same role in this example as in the previous examples. The examples above call into two different custom completions, based on the position the user is currently in.\n\n## Custom Descriptions and Styles\n\nAs an alternative to returning a list of strings, a completion function can also return a list of records with a `value` field as well as optional `description` and `style` fields. The style can be one of the following:\n\n- A string with the foreground color, either a hex code or a color name such as `yellow`.

    Documentation text:

    # Special Variables

    Nushell makes available and uses a number of special variables and constants. Many of these are mentioned or documented in other places in this Book, but this page
    should include _all_ variables for reference.

    [[toc]]

    ## `$nu`

    The `$nu` constant is a record containing several useful values:

    - `default-config-dir`: The directory where the configuration files are stored and read.
    - `config-path`: The path of the main Nushell config file, normally `config.nu` in the config directory.
    - `env-path`: The optional environment config file, normally `env.nu` in the config directory.
    - `history-path`: The text or SQLite file storing the command history.
    - `loginshell-path`: The optional config file which runs for login shells, normally `login.nu` in the config directory.
    - `plugin-path`: The plugin registry file, normally `plugin.msgpackz` in the config directory.
    - `home-path`: The user's home directory which can be accessed using the shorthand `~`.
    - `data-dir`: The data directory for Nushell, which includes the `./vendor/autoload` directories loaded at startup and other user data.
    - `cache-dir`: A directory for non-essential (cached) data.
    - `vendor-autoload-dirs`: A list of directories where third-party applications should install configuration files that will be auto-loaded during startup.
    - `user-autoload-dirs`: A list of directories where the user may create additional configuration files which will be auto-loaded during startup.
    - `temp-path`: A path for temporary files that should be writeable by the user.
    - `pid`: The PID of the currently running Nushell process.
    - `os-info`: Information about the host operating system.
    - `startup-time`: The amount of time (in duration) that it took for Nushell to start and process all configuration files.
    - `is-interactive`: A boolean indicating whether Nushell was started as an interactive shell (`true`) or is running a script or command-string. For example:

      ```nu
      $nu.is-interactive
      # => true
      nu -c "$nu.is-interactive"
      # => false

      # Force interactive with --interactive (-i)
      nu -i -c "$nu.is-interactive"
      # => true
      ```

      Note: When started as an interactive shell, startup config files are processed. When started as a non-interactive shell, no config files are read unless explicitly called via flag.

    - `is-login`: Indicates whether or not Nushell was started as a login shell.
    - `history-enabled`: History may be disabled via `nu --no-history`, in which case this constant will be `false`.
    - `current-exe`: The full path to the currently-running `nu` binary. Can be combined with `path dirname` (which is constant) to determine the directory where the binary is located.

    ## `$env`

    `$env` is a special mutable variable containing the current environment variables. As with any process, the initial environment is inherited from the parent process which started `nu`.

    There are also several environment variables that Nushell uses for specific purposes:

    ### `$env.config`

    `$env.config` is the main configuration record used in Nushell. Settings are documented in `config nu --doc`.

    ### `$env.PATH`

    The search path for executing other applications. It is initially inherited from the parent process as a string, but converted to a Nushell `list` at startup for easy access.

    It is converted back to a string before running a child-process.

    ### `$env.ENV_CONVERSIONS`

    Allows users to specify how to convert certain environment variables to Nushell types. See [ENV_CONVERSIONS](./configuration.md#env-conversions).

    ### `$env.LAST_EXIT_CODE`

    The exit code of the last command, usually used for external commands — Equivalent to `$?` from POSIX. Note that this information is also made available to the `catch` block in a `try` expression for external commands. For instance:

    ```nu
    ^ls file-that-does-not-exist e> /dev/null
    $env.LAST_EXIT_CODE
    # => 2

    # or
    try {
      ^ls file-that-does-not-exist e> /dev/null
    } catch {|e|
      print $e.exit_code
    }
    # => 2
    ```

    ### `$env.CMD_DURATION_MS`

    The amount of time in milliseconds that the previous command took to run.

    ### `$env.NU_VERSION`

    The current Nushell version. The same as `(version).version`, but, as an environment variable, it is exported to and can be read by child processes.

    ### `$env.CURRENT_FILE`

    Inside a script, module, or sourced-file, this variable holds the fully-qualified filename. Note that this
    information is also available as a constant through the [`path self`](/commands/docs/path_self.md) command.

    ### `$env.FILE_PWD`

    Inside a script, module, or sourced-file, this variable holds the fully qualified name of the directory in which
    the file resides. Note that this value is also available as a constant through:

    ```nu
    path self | path dirname
    ```

    ### `$env.PROCESS_PATH`

    When _executing a script_, this variable represents the name and relative path of the script. Unlike the two variables
    above, it is not present when sourcing a file or importing a module.

    Note: Also unlike the two variables above, the exact path (including symlinks) that was used to _invoke_ the file is returned.

    ### `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS`

    A list of directories which will be searched when using the `source`, `use`, or `overlay use` commands. See also:

    - The `$NU_LIB_DIRS` constant below
    - [Module Path](./modules/using_modules.md#module-path)
    - [Configuration - `$NU_LIB_DIRS`](./configuration.md#nu-lib-dirs-constant)

    ### `$env.NU_PLUGIN_DIRS`

    A list of directories which will be searched when registering plugins with `plugin add`. See also:

    - [Plugin Search Path](./plugins.md#plugin-search-path)

    ### `$env.PROMPT_*` and `$env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_*`

    A number of variables are available for configuring the Nushell prompt that appears on each commandline. See also:

    - [Configuration - Prompt Configuration](./configuration.md#prompt-configuration)
    - `config nu --doc`

    ### `$env.SHLVL`

    `SHLVL` is incremented by most shells when entering a new subshell. It can be used to determine the number of nested shells. For instance,
    if `$env.SHLVL == 2` then typing `exit` should return you to a parent shell.

    ### `$env.XDG_CONFIG_HOME`

    Can be used to optionally override the `$nu.default-config-dir` location. See [Configuration - Startup Variables](./configuration.md#startup-variables).

    ### `$env.XDG_DATA_DIR`

    Can be used to optionally override the `$nu.data-dir` location. See [Configuration - Startup Variables](./configuration.md#startup-variables).

    ## `$in`

    The `$in` variable represents the pipeline input into an expression. See [Pipelines - The Special `$in` Variable](./pipelines.md#pipeline-input-and-the-special-in-variable).

    ## `$it`

    `$it` is a special variable that is _only_ available in a `where` "row condition" — a convenient shorthand which simplifies field access. See `help where` for more information.

    ## `$NU_LIB_DIRS`

    A constant version of `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS` - a list of directories which will be searched when using the `source`, `use`, or `overlay use` commands. See also:

    - [Module Path](./modules/using_modules.md#module-path)
    - [Configuration - `$NU_LIB_DIRS`](./configuration.md#nu-lib-dirs-constant)

    ## `$NU_PLUGIN_DIRS`

    A constant version of `$env.NU_PLUGIN_DIRS` - a list of directories which will be searched when registering plugins with `plugin add`. See also:

    - [Plugin Search Path](./plugins.md#plugin-search-path)

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `aliases page of the documentation provided by Nushell`.



    Documentation text:

    # Aliases

    Aliases in Nushell offer a way of doing a simple replacement of command calls (both external and internal commands). This allows you to create a shorthand name for a longer command, including its default arguments.

    For example, let's create an alias called `ll` which will expand to `ls -l`.

    ```nu
    alias ll = ls -l
    ```

    We can now call this alias:

    ```nu
    ll
    ```

    Once we do, it's as if we typed `ls -l`. This also allows us to pass in flags or positional parameters. For example, we can now also write:

    ```nu
    ll -a
    ```

    And get the equivalent to having typed `ls -l -a`.

    ## List All Loaded Aliases

    Your useable aliases can be seen in `scope aliases` and `help aliases`.

    ## Persisting

    To make your aliases persistent they must be added to your _config.nu_ file by running `config nu` to open an editor and inserting them, and then restarting nushell.
    e.g. with the above `ll` alias, you can add `alias ll = ls -l` anywhere in _config.nu_

    ```nu
    $env.config = {
        # main configuration
    }

    alias ll = ls -l

    # some other config and script loading
    ```

    ## Piping in Aliases

    Note that `alias uuidgen = uuidgen | tr A-F a-f` (to make uuidgen on mac behave like linux) won't work.
    The solution is to define a command without parameters that calls the system program `uuidgen` via `^`.

    ```nu
    def uuidgen [] { ^uuidgen | tr A-F a-f }
    ```

    See more in the [custom commands](custom_commands.md) section of this book.

    Or a more idiomatic example with nushell internal commands

    ```nu
    def lsg [] { ls | sort-by type name -i | grid -c | str trim }
    ```

    displaying all listed files and folders in a grid.

    ## Replacing Existing Commands Using Aliases

    ::: warning Caution!
    When replacing commands it is best to "back up" the command first and avoid recursion error.
    :::

    How to back up a command like `ls`:

    ```nu
    alias core-ls = ls    # This will create a new alias core-ls for ls
    ```

    Now you can use `core-ls` as `ls` in your nu-programming. You will see further down how to use `core-ls`.

    The reason you need to use alias is because, unlike `def`, aliases are position-dependent. So, you need to "back up" the old command first with an alias, before re-defining it.
    If you do not backup the command and you replace the command using `def` you get a recursion error.

    ```nu
    def ls [] { ls }; ls    # Do *NOT* do this! This will throw a recursion error

    #output:
    #Error: nu::shell::recursion_limit_reached
    #
    #  × Recursion limit (50) reached
    #     ╭─[C:\Users\zolodev\AppData\Roaming\nushell\config.nu:807:1]
    # 807 │
    # 808 │ def ls [] { ls }; ls
    #     ·           ───┬──
    #     ·              ╰── This called itself too many times
    #     ╰────
    ```

    The recommended way to replace an existing command is to shadow the command.
    Here is an example shadowing the `ls` command.

    ```nu
    # alias the built-in ls command to ls-builtins
    alias ls-builtin = ls

    # List the filenames, sizes, and modification times of items in a directory.
    def ls [
        --all (-a),         # Show hidden files
        --long (-l),        # Get all available columns for each entry (slower; columns are platform-dependent)
        --short-names (-s), # Only print the file names, and not the path
        --full-paths (-f),  # display paths as absolute paths
        --du (-d),          # Display the apparent directory size ("disk usage") in place of the directory metadata size
        --directory (-D),   # List the specified directory itself instead of its contents
        --mime-type (-m),   # Show mime-type in type column instead of 'file' (based on filenames only; files' contents are not examined)
        --threads (-t),     # Use multiple threads to list contents. Output will be non-deterministic.
        ...pattern: glob,   # The glob pattern to use.
    ]: [ nothing -> table ] {
        let pattern = if ($pattern | is-empty) { [ '.' ] } else { $pattern }
        (ls-builtin
            --all=$all
            --long=$long
            --short-names=$short_names
            --full-paths=$full_paths
            --du=$du
            --directory=$directory
            --mime-type=$mime_type
            --threads=$threads
            ...$pattern
        ) | sort-by type name -i
    }
    ```

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `overlays page of the documentation provided by Nushell`.



    Documentation text:

    # Overlays

    Overlays act as "layers" of definitions (custom commands, aliases, environment variables) that can be activated and deactivated on demand.
    They resemble virtual environments found in some languages, such as Python.

    _Note: To understand overlays, make sure to check [Modules](modules.md) first as overlays build on top of modules._

    ## Basics

    First, Nushell comes with one default overlay called `zero`.
    You can inspect which overlays are active with the [`overlay list`](/commands/docs/overlay_list.md) command.
    You should see the default overlay listed there.

    To create a new overlay, you first need a module:

    ```nu
    module spam {
        export def foo [] {
            "foo"
        }

        export alias bar = echo "bar"

        export-env {
            load-env { BAZ: "baz" }
        }
    }
    ```

    We'll use this module throughout the chapter, so whenever you see `overlay use spam`, assume `spam` is referring to this module.

    ::: tip
    The module can be created by any of the three methods described in [Modules](modules.md):

    - "inline" modules (used in this example)
    - file
    - directory
    :::

    To create the overlay, call [`overlay use`](/commands/docs/overlay_use.md):

    ```nu
    overlay use spam

    foo
    # => foo

    bar
    # => bar

    $env.BAZ
    # => baz

    overlay list
    # => ───┬──────
    # =>  0 │ zero
    # =>  1 │ spam
    # => ───┴──────
    ```

    It brought the module's definitions into the current scope and evaluated the [`export-env`](/commands/docs/export-env.md) block the same way as [`use`](/commands/docs/use.md) command would (see [Modules](modules.md#environment-variables) chapter).

    ::: tip
    In the following sections, the `>` prompt will be preceded by the name of the last active overlay.
    `(spam)> some-command` means the `spam` overlay is the last active overlay when the command was typed.
    :::

    ## Removing an Overlay

    If you don't need the overlay definitions anymore, call [`overlay hide`](/commands/docs/overlay_hide.md):

    ```nu
    (spam)> overlay hide spam

    (zero)> foo
    Error: Can't run executable...

    (zero)> overlay list
    ───┬──────
     0 │ zero
    ───┴──────
    ```

    The overlays are also scoped.
    Any added overlays are removed at the end of the scope:

    ```nu
    (zero)> do { overlay use spam; foo }  # overlay is active only inside the block
    foo

    (zero)> overlay list
    ───┬──────
     0 │ zero
    ───┴──────
    ```

    The last way to remove an overlay is to call [`overlay hide`](/commands/docs/overlay_hide.md) without an argument which will remove the last active overlay.

    ## Overlays Are Recordable

    Any new definition (command, alias, environment variable) is recorded into the last active overlay:

    ```nu
    (zero)> overlay use spam

    (spam)> def eggs [] { "eggs" }
    ```

    Now, the `eggs` command belongs to the `spam` overlay.
    If we remove the overlay, we can't call it anymore:

    ```nu
    (spam)> overlay hide spam

    (zero)> eggs
    Error: Can't run executable...
    ```

    But we can bring it back!

    ```nu
    (zero)> overlay use spam

    (spam)> eggs
    eggs
    ```

    Overlays remember what you add to them and store that information even if you remove them.
    This can let you repeatedly swap between different contexts.

    ::: tip
    Sometimes, after adding an overlay, you might not want custom definitions to be added into it.
    The solution can be to create a new empty overlay that would be used just for recording the custom changes:

    ```nu
    (zero)> overlay use spam

    (spam)> module scratchpad { }

    (spam)> overlay use scratchpad

    (scratchpad)> def eggs [] { "eggs" }
    ```

    The `eggs` command is added into `scratchpad` while keeping `spam` intact.

    To make it less verbose, you can use the [`overlay new`](/commands/docs/overlay_new.md) command:

    ```nu
    (zero)> overlay use spam

    (spam)> overlay new scratchpad

    (scratchpad)> def eggs [] { "eggs" }
    ```

    :::

    ## Prefixed Overlays

    The [`overlay use`](/commands/docs/overlay_use.md) command would take all commands and aliases from the module and put them directly into the current namespace.
    However, you might want to keep them as subcommands behind the module's name.
    That's what `--prefix` is for:

    ```nu
    (zero)> module spam {
        export def foo [] { "foo" }
    }

    (zero)> overlay use --prefix spam

    (spam)> spam foo
    foo
    ```

    Note that this does not apply for environment variables.

    ## Rename an Overlay

    You can change the name of the added overlay with the `as` keyword:

    ```nu
    (zero)> module spam { export def foo [] { "foo" } }

    (zero)> overlay use spam as eggs

    (eggs)> foo
    foo

    (eggs)> overlay hide eggs

    (zero)>
    ```

    This can be useful if you have a generic script name, such as virtualenv's `activate.nu` but you want a more descriptive name for your overlay.

    ## Preserving Definitions

    Sometimes, you might want to remove an overlay, but keep all the custom definitions you added without having to redefine them in the next active overlay:

    ```nu
    (zero)> overlay use spam

    (spam)> def eggs [] { "eggs" }

    (spam)> overlay hide --keep-custom spam

    (zero)> eggs
    eggs
    ```

    The `--keep-custom` flag does exactly that.

    One can also keep a list of environment variables that were defined inside an overlay, but remove the rest, using the `--keep-env` flag:

    ```nu
    (zero)> module spam {
        export def foo [] { "foo" }
        export-env { $env.FOO = "foo" }
    }

    (zero)> overlay use spam

    (spam)> overlay hide spam --keep-env [ FOO ]

    (zero)> foo
    Error: Can't run executable...

    (zero)> $env.FOO
    foo
    ```

    ## Ordering Overlays

    The overlays are arranged as a stack.
    If multiple overlays contain the same definition, say `foo`, the one from the last active one would take precedence.
    To bring an overlay to the top of the stack, you can call [`overlay use`](/commands/docs/overlay_use.md) again:

    ```nu
    (zero)> def foo [] { "foo-in-zero" }

    (zero)> overlay use spam

    (spam)> foo
    foo

    (spam)> overlay use zero

    (zero)> foo
    foo-in-zero

    (zero)> overlay list
    ───┬──────
     0 │ spam
     1 │ zero
    ───┴──────
    ```

    Now, the `zero` overlay takes precedence.

    Documentation text:

    # Creating Your Own Errors

    Using the [metadata](metadata.md) information, you can create your own custom error messages. Error messages are built of multiple parts:

    - The title of the error
    - The label of error message, which includes both the text of the label and the span to underline

    You can use the [`error make`](/commands/docs/error_make.md) command to create your own error messages. For example, let's say you had your own command called `my-command` and you wanted to give an error back to the caller about something wrong with a parameter that was passed in.

    First, you can take the span of where the argument is coming from:

    ```nu
    let span = (metadata $x).span;
    ```

    Next, you can create an error using the [`error make`](/commands/docs/error_make.md) command. This command takes in a record that describes the error to create:

    ```nu
    error make {msg: "this is fishy", label: {text: "fish right here", span: $span } }
    ```

    Together with your custom command, it might look like this:

    ```nu
    def my-command [x] {
        let span = (metadata $x).span;
        error make {
            msg: "this is fishy",

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `pipelines page of the documentation provided by Nushell`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# Pipelines\n\nOne of the core designs of Nu is the pipeline, a design idea that traces its roots back decades to some of the original philosophy behind Unix. Just as Nu extends from the single string data type of Unix, Nu also extends the idea of the pipeline to include more than just text.\n\n## Basics\n\nA pipeline is composed of three parts: the input, the filter, and the output.\n\n```nu\nopen Cargo.toml | update workspace.dependencies.base64 0.24.2 | save Cargo_new.toml\n```\n\nThe first command, `open Cargo.toml`, is an input (sometimes also called a \"source\" or \"producer\"). This creates or loads data and feeds it into a pipeline. It's from input that pipelines have values to work with. Commands like [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) are also inputs, as they take data from the filesystem and send it through the pipelines so that it can be used.\n\nThe second command, `update workspace.dependencies.base64 0.24.2`, is a filter. Filters take the data they are given and often do something with it. They may change it (as with the [`update`](/commands/docs/update.md) command in our example), or they may perform other operations, like logging, as the values pass through.\n\nThe last command, `save Cargo_new.toml`, is an output (sometimes called a \"sink\"). An output takes input from the pipeline and does some final operation on it. In our example, we save what comes through the pipeline to a file as the final step. Other types of output commands may take the values and view them for the user.\n\nThe `$in` variable will collect the pipeline into a value for you, allowing you to access the whole stream as a parameter:\n\n```nu\n[1 2 3] | $in.1 * $in.2\n# => 6\n```\n\n## Multi-line pipelines\n\nIf a pipeline is getting a bit long for one line, you can enclose it within parentheses `()`:\n\n```nu\nlet year = (\n    \"01/22/2021\" |\n    parse \"{month}/{day}/{year}\" |\n    get year\n)\n```\n\n## Semicolons\n\nTake this example:\n\n```nu\nline1; line2 | line3\n```\n\nHere, semicolons are used in conjunction with pipelines. When a semicolon is used, no output data is produced to be piped. As such, the `$in` variable will not work when used immediately after the semicolon.\n\n- As there is a semicolon after `line1`, the command will run to completion and get displayed on the screen.\n- `line2` | `line3` is a normal pipeline. It runs, and its contents are displayed after `line1`'s contents.\n\n## Pipeline Input and the Special `$in` Variable\n\nMuch of Nu's composability comes from the special `$in` variable, which holds the current pipeline input.\n\n`$in` is particular useful when used in:\n\n- Command or external parameters\n- Filters\n- Custom command definitions or scripts that accept pipeline input\n\n### `$in` as a Command Argument or as Part of an Expression\n\nCompare the following two command-lines that create a directory with tomorrow's date as part of the name. The following are equivalent:\n\nUsing subexpressions:\n\n```nu\nmkdir $'((date now) + 1day | format date '%F') Report'\n```\n\nor using pipelines:\n\n```nu\ndate now                    # 1: today\n| $in + 1day                # 2: tomorrow\n| format date '%F'          # 3: Format as YYYY-MM-DD\n| $'($in) Report'           # 4: Format the directory name\n| mkdir $in                 # 5: Create the directory\n```\n\nWhile the second form may be overly verbose for this contrived example, you'll notice several advantages:\n\n- It can be composed step-by-step with a simple <kbd>↑</kbd> (up arrow) to repeat the previous command and add the next stage of the pipeline.\n- It's arguably more readable.\n- Each step can, if needed, be commented.\n- Each step in the pipeline can be [`inspect`ed for debugging](/commands/docs/inspect.html).\n\nLet's examine the contents of `$in` on each line of the above example:\n\n- On line 2, `$in` refers to the results of line 1's `date now` (a datetime value).\n- On line 4, `$in` refers to tomorrow's formatted date from line 3 and is used in an interpolated string\n- On line 5, `$in` refers to the results of line 4's interpolated string, e.g. '2024-05-14 Report'\n\n### Pipeline Input in Filter Closures\n\nCertain [filter commands](/commands/categories/filters.html) may modify the pipeline input to their closure in order to provide more convenient access to the expected context. For example:\n\n```nu\n1..10 | each {$in * 2}\n```\n\nRather than referring to the entire range of 10 digits, the `each` filter modifies `$in` to refer to the value of the _current iteration_.\n\nIn most filters, the pipeline input and its resulting `$in` will be the same as the closure parameter. For the `each` filter, the following example is equivalent to the one above:\n\n```nu\n1..10 | each {|value| $value * 2}\n```\n\nHowever, some filters will assign an even more convenient value to their closures' input. The `update` filter is one example. The pipeline input to the `update` command's closure (as well as `$in`) refers to the _column_ being updated, while the closure parameter refers to the entire record. As a result, the following two examples are also equivalent:\n\n```nu\nls | update name {|file| $file.name | str upcase}\nls | update name {str upcase}\n```\n\nWith most filters, the second version would refer to the entire `file` record (with `name`, `type`, `size`, and `modified` columns). However, with `update`, it refers specifically to the contents of the _column_ being updated, in this case `name`.\n\n### Pipeline Input in Custom Command Definitions and Scripts\n\nSee: [Custom Commands -> Pipeline Input](custom_commands.html#pipeline-input)\n\n### When Does `$in` Change (and when can it be reused)?\n\n- **_Rule 1:_** When used in the first position of a pipeline in a closure or block, `$in` refers to the pipeline (or filter) input to the closure/block.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```nushell\n  def echo_me [] {\n    print $in\n  }\n  true | echo_me\n  # => true\n  ```\n\n- **_Rule 1.5:_** This is true throughout the current scope. Even on subsequent lines in a closure or block, `$in` is the same value when used in the first position of _any pipeline_ inside that scope.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```nu\n  [ a b c ] | each {\n    print $in\n    print $in\n    $in\n  }\n  ```\n\n  All three of the `$in` values are the same on each iteration, so this outputs:\n\n  ```nu\n  a\n  a\n  b\n  b\n  c\n  c\n  ╭───┬───╮\n  │ 0 │ a │\n  │ 1 │ b │\n  │ 2 │ c │\n  ╰───┴───╯\n  ```\n\n- **_Rule 2:_** When used anywhere else in a pipeline (other than the first position), `$in` refers to the previous expression's result:\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```nushell\n  4               # Pipeline input\n  | $in * $in     # $in is 4 in this expression\n  | $in / 2       # $in is now 16 in this expression\n  | $in           # $in is now 8\n  # =>   8\n  ```\n\n- **_Rule 2.5:_** Inside a closure or block, Rule 2 usage occurs inside a new scope (a sub-expression) where that \"new\" `$in` value is valid. This means that Rule 1 and Rule 2 usage can coexist in the same closure or block.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```nushell\n  4 | do {\n    print $in            # closure-scope $in is 4\n\n    let p = (            # explicit sub-expression, but one will be created regardless\n      $in * $in          # initial-pipeline position $in is still 4 here\n      | $in / 2          # $in is now 16\n    )                    # $p is the result, 8 - Sub-expression scope ends\n\n    print $in            # At the closure-scope, the \"original\" $in is still 4\n    print $p\n  }\n  ```\n\n  So the output from the 3 `print` statements is:\n\n  ```nu\n  4\n  4\n  8\n  ```\n\n  Again, this would hold true even if the command above used the more compact, implicit sub-expression form:\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```nushell\n  4 | do {\n    print $in                       # closure-scope $in is 4\n    let p = $in * $in | $in / 2     # Implicit let sub-expression\n    print $in                       # At the closure-scope, $in is still 4\n    print $p\n  }\n\n  4\n  4\n  8\n  ```\n\n- **_Rule 3:_** When used with no input, `$in` is null.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```nushell\n  # Input\n  1 | do { $in | describe }\n  # =>   int\n  \"Hello, Nushell\" | do { $in | describe }\n  # =>   string\n  {||} | do { $in | describe }\n  # =>   closure\n\n  # No input\n  do { $in | describe }\n  # =>   nothing\n  ```\n\n* **_Rule 4:_** In a multi-statement line separated by semicolons, `$in` cannot be used to capture the results of the previous _statement_.\n\n  This is the same as having no-input:\n\n  ```nushell\n  ls / | get name; $in | describe\n  # => nothing\n  ```\n\n  Instead, simply continue the pipeline:\n\n  ```nushell\n  ls / | get name | $in | describe\n  # => list<string>\n  ```\n\n### Best practice for `$in` in Multiline Code\n\nWhile `$in` can be reused as demonstrated above, assigning its value to another variable in the first line of your closure/block will often aid in readability and debugging.\n\nExample:\n\n```nu\ndef \"date info\" [] {\n  let day = $in\n  print ($day | format date '%v')\n  print $'... was a ($day | format date '%A')'\n  print $'... was day ($day | format date '%j') of the year'\n}\n\n'2000-01-01' | date info\n# =>  1-Jan-2000\n# => ... was a Saturday\n# => ... was day 001 of the year\n```\n\n### Collectability of `$in`\n\nCurrently, the use of `$in` on a stream in a pipeline results in a \"collected\" value, meaning the pipeline \"waits\" on the stream to complete before handling `$in` with the full results. However, this behavior is not guaranteed in future releases. To ensure that a stream is collected into a single variable, use the [`collect` command](/commands/docs/collect.html).\n\nLikewise, avoid using `$in` when normal pipeline input will suffice, as internally `$in` forces a conversion from `PipelineData` to `Value` and _may_ result in decreased performance and/or increased memory usage.\n\n## Working with External Commands\n\nNu commands communicate with each other using the Nu data types (see [types of data](types_of_data.md)), but what about commands outside of Nu? Let's look at some examples of working with external commands:\n\n`internal_command | external_command`\n\nData will flow from the internal_command to the external_command. This data will get converted to a string, so that they can be sent to the `stdin` of the external_command.\n\n`external_command | internal_command`\n\nData coming from an external command into Nu will come in as bytes that Nushell will try to automatically convert to UTF-8 text. If successful, a stream of text data will be sent to internal_command. If unsuccessful, a stream of binary data will be sent to internal command. Commands like [`lines`](/commands/docs/lines.md) help make it easier to bring in data from external commands, as it gives discrete lines of data to work with.\n\n`external_command_1 | external_command_2`\n\nNu works with data piped between two external commands in the same way as other shells, like Bash would. The `stdout` of external_command_1 is connected to the `stdin` of external_command_2. This lets data flow naturally between the two commands.\n\n### Command Input and Output Types\n\nThe Basics section above describes how commands can be combined in pipelines as input, filters, or output.\nHow you can use commands depends on what they offer in terms of input/output handling.\n\nYou can check what a command supports with [`help <command name>`](/commands/docs/help.md), which shows the relevant *Input/output types*.\n\nFor example, through `help first` we can see that the [`first` command](/commands/docs/first.md) supports multiple input and output types:\n\n```nu\nhelp first\n# => […]\n# => Input/output types:\n# =>   ╭───┬───────────┬────────╮\n# =>   │ # │   input   │ output │\n# =>   ├───┼───────────┼────────┤\n# =>   │ 0 │ list<any> │ any    │\n# =>   │ 1 │ binary    │ binary │\n# =>   │ 2 │ range     │ any    │\n# =>   ╰───┴───────────┴────────╯\n\n[a b c] | first                                                                                                                                   took 1ms\n# => a\n\n1..4 | first                                                                                                                                     took 21ms\n# => 1\n```\n\nAs another example, the [`ls` command](/commands/docs/ls.md) supports output but not input:\n\n```nu\nhelp ls\n# => […]\n# => Input/output types:\n# =>   ╭───┬─────────┬────────╮\n# =>   │ # │  input  │ output │\n# =>   ├───┼─────────┼────────┤\n# =>   │ 0 │ nothing │ table  │\n# =>   ╰───┴─────────┴────────╯\n```\n\nThis means, for example, that attempting to pipe into `ls` (`echo .. | ls`) leads to unintended results.\nThe input stream is ignored, and `ls` defaults to listing the current directory.\n\nTo integrate a command like `ls` into a pipeline, you have to explicitly reference the input and pass it as a parameter:\n\n```nu\necho .. | ls $in\n```\n\nNote that this only works if `$in` matches the argument type. For example, `[dir1 dir2] | ls $in` will fail with the error `can't convert list<string> to string`.\n\nOther commands without default behavior may fail in different ways, and with explicit errors.\n\nFor example, `help sleep` tells us that [`sleep`](/commands/docs/sleep.md) supports no input and no output types:\n\n```nu\nhelp sleep\n# => […]\n# => Input/output types:\n# =>   ╭───┬─────────┬─────────╮\n# =>   │ # │  input  │ output  │\n# =>   ├───┼─────────┼─────────┤\n# =>   │ 0 │ nothing │ nothing │\n# =>   ╰───┴─────────┴─────────╯\n```\n\nWhen we erroneously pipe into it, instead of unintended behavior like in the `ls` example above, we receive an error:\n\n```nu\necho 1sec | sleep\n# => Error: nu::parser::missing_positional\n# => \n# =>   × Missing required positional argument.\n# =>    ╭─[entry #53:1:18]\n# =>  1 │ echo 1sec | sleep\n# =>    ╰────\n# =>   help: Usage: sleep <duration> ...(rest) . Use `--help` for more information.\n```\n\nWhile there is no steadfast rule, Nu generally tries to copy established conventions in command behavior,\nor do what 'feels right'.\nThe `sleep` behavior of not supporting an input stream matches Bash `sleep` behavior for example.\n\nMany commands do have piped input/output however, and if it's ever unclear, check their `help` documentation as described above.\n\n## Behind the Scenes\n\nYou may have wondered how we see a table if [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) is an input and not an output. Nu adds this output for us automatically using another command called [`table`](/commands/docs/table.md). The [`table`](/commands/docs/table.md) command is appended to any pipeline that doesn't have an output. This allows us to see the result.\n\nIn effect, the command:\n\n```nu\nls\n```\n\nAnd the pipeline:\n\n```nu\nls | table\n```\n\nAre one and the same.\n\n::: tip Note\nThe phrase _\"are one and the same\"_ above only applies to the graphical output in the shell, it does not mean the two data structures are the same:\n\n```nu\n(ls) == (ls | table)\n# => false\n```\n\n`ls | table` is not even structured data!\n:::\n\n## Output Result to External Commands\n\nSometimes you want to output Nushell structured data to an external command for further processing. However, Nushell's default formatting options for structured data may not be what you want.\nFor example, you want to find a file named \"tutor\" under \"/usr/share/vim/runtime\" and check its ownership\n\n```nu\nls /usr/share/nvim/runtime/\n# => ╭────┬───────────────────────────────────────┬──────┬─────────┬───────────────╮\n# => │  # │                 name                  │ type │  size   │   modified    │\n# => ├────┼───────────────────────────────────────┼──────┼─────────┼───────────────┤\n# => │  0 │ /usr/share/nvim/runtime/autoload      │ dir  │  4.1 KB │ 2 days ago    │\n# => ..........\n# => ..........\n# => ..........\n# => \n# => │ 31 │ /usr/share/nvim/runtime/tools         │ dir  │  4.1 KB │ 2 days ago    │\n# => │ 32 │ /usr/share/nvim/runtime/tutor         │ dir  │  4.1 KB │ 2 days ago    │\n# => ├────┼───────────────────────────────────────┼──────┼─────────┼───────────────┤\n# => │  # │                 name                  │ type │  size   │   modified    │\n# => ╰────┴───────────────────────────────────────┴──────┴─────────┴───────────────╯\n```\n\nYou decided to use `grep` and [pipe](https://www.nushell.sh/book/pipelines.html) the result to external `^ls`\n\n```nu\nls /usr/share/nvim/runtime/ | get name | ^grep tutor | ^ls -la $in\n# => ls: cannot access ''$'\\342\\224\\202'' 32 '$'\\342\\224\\202'' /usr/share/nvim/runtime/tutor        '$'\\342\\224\\202\\n': No such file or directory\n```\n\nWhat's wrong? Nushell renders lists and tables (by adding a border with characters like `╭`,`─`,`┬`,`╮`) before piping them as text to external commands. If that's not the behavior you want, you must explicitly convert the data to a string before piping it to an external. For example, you can do so with [`to text`](/commands/docs/to_text.md):\n\n```nu\nls /usr/share/nvim/runtime/ | get name | to text | ^grep tutor | tr -d '\\n' | ^ls -la $in\n# => total 24\n# => drwxr-xr-x@  5 pengs  admin   160 14 Nov 13:12 .\n# => drwxr-xr-x@  4 pengs  admin   128 14 Nov 13:42 en\n# => -rw-r--r--@  1 pengs  admin  5514 14 Nov 13:42 tutor.tutor\n# => -rw-r--r--@  1 pengs  admin  1191 14 Nov 13:42 tutor.tutor.json\n```\n\n(Actually, for this simple usage you can just use [`find`](/commands/docs/find.md))\n\n```nu\nls /usr/share/nvim/runtime/ | get name | find tutor | ansi strip | ^ls -al ...$in\n```\n\n## Command Output in Nushell\n\nUnlike external commands, Nushell commands are akin to functions. Most Nushell commands do not print anything to `stdout` and instead just return data.\n\n```nu\ndo { ls; ls; ls; \"What?!\" }\n```\n\nThis means that the above code will not display the files under the current directory three times.\nIn fact, running this in the shell will only display `\"What?!\"` because that is the value returned by the `do` command in this example. However, using the system `^ls` command instead of `ls` would indeed print the directory thrice because `^ls` does print its result once it runs.\n\nKnowing when data is displayed is important when using configuration variables that affect the display output of commands such as `table`.\n\n```nu\ndo { $env.config.table.mode = \"none\"; ls }\n```\n\nFor instance, the above example sets the `$env.config.table.mode` configuration variable to `none`, which causes the `table` command to render data without additional borders. However, as it was shown earlier, the command is effectively equivalent to\n\n```nu\ndo { $env.config.table.mode = \"none\"; ls } | table\n```\n\nBecause Nushell `$env` variables are [scoped](https://www.nushell.sh/book/environment.html#scoping), this means that the `table` command in the example is not affected by the\nenvironment modification inside the `do` block and the data will not be shown with the applied configuration.\n\nWhen displaying data early is desired, it is possible to explicitly apply `| table` inside the scope, or use the `print` command.\n\n```nu\ndo { $env.config.table.mode = \"none\"; ls | table }\ndo { $env.config.table.mode = \"none\"; print (ls) }\n```"

    Documentation text:

    # Types of Data

    Traditional Unix shell commands communicate with each other using strings of text -- One command writes text to standard output (often abbreviated `stdout`) and the other reads text from standard input (or `stdin`). This allows multiple commands to be combined together to communicate through what is called a "pipeline".

    Nushell embraces this approach and expands it to include other types of data in addition to strings.

    Like many programming languages, Nu models data using a set of simple, structured data types. Simple data types include integers, floats, strings, and booleans. There are also special types for dates, file sizes, and time durations.

    The [`describe`](/commands/docs/describe.md) command returns the type of a data value:

    ```nu
    42 | describe
    # => int
    ```

    ## Basic Data Types

    ### Integers

    |                       |                                                                                                                                                           |
    | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **_Description:_**    | Numbers without a fractional component (positive, negative, and 0)                                                                                        |
    | **_Annotation:_**     | `int`                                                                                                                                                     |
    | **_Literal Syntax:_** | A decimal, hex, octal, or binary numeric value without a decimal place. E.g., `-100`, `0`, `50`, `+50`, `0xff` (hex), `0o234` (octal), `0b10101` (binary) |
    | **_See also:_**       | [Language Reference - Integer](/lang-guide/chapters/types/basic_types/int.md)                                                                             |

    Simple Example:

    ```nu
    10 / 2
    # => 5
    5 | describe
    # => int
    ```

    ### Floats/Decimals

    |                       |                                                                                  |
    | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **_Description:_**    | Numbers with some fractional component                                           |
    | **_Annotation:_**     | `float`                                                                          |
    | **_Literal Syntax:_** | A decimal numeric value including a decimal place. E.g., `1.5`, `2.0`, `-15.333` |
    | **_See also:_**       | [Language Reference - Float](/lang-guide/chapters/types/basic_types/float.md)    |

    Simple Example:

    ```nu
    2.5 / 5.0
    # => 0.5
    ```

    ::: tip
    As in most programming languages, decimal values in Nushell are approximate.

    ```nu
    10.2 * 5.1
    # => 52.01999999999999
    ```

    :::

    ### Text/Strings

    |                       |                                                                                 |
    | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **_Description:_**    | A series of characters that represents text                                     |
    | **_Annotation:_**     | `string`                                                                        |
    | **_Literal Syntax:_** | See [Working with strings](working_with_strings.md)                             |
    | **_See also:_**       | [Handling Strings](/book/loading_data.html#handling-strings)                    |
    |                       | [Language Reference - String](/lang-guide/chapters/types/basic_types/string.md) |

    As with many languages, Nushell provides multiple ways to specify String values and numerous commands for working with strings.

    Simple (obligatory) example:

    ```nu
    let audience: string = "World"
    $"Hello, ($audience)"
    # => Hello, World
    ```

    ### Booleans

    |                       |                                                                                |
    | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | **_Description:_**    | True or False value                                                            |
    | **_Annotation:_**     | `bool`                                                                         |
    | **_Literal Syntax:_** | Either a literal `true` or `false`                                             |
    | **_See also:_**       | [Language Reference - Boolean](/lang-guide/chapters/types/basic_types/bool.md) |

    Booleans are commonly the result of a comparison. For example:

    ```nu
    let mybool: bool = (2 > 1)
    $mybool
    # => true
    let mybool: bool = ($env.HOME | path exists)
    $mybool
    # => true
    ```

    A boolean result is commonly used to control the flow of execution:

    ```nu
    let num = -2
    if $num < 0 { print "It's negative" }
    # => It's negative
    ```

    ### Dates

    |                       |                                                                                        |
    | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **_Description:_**    | Represents a specific point in time using international standard date-time descriptors |
    | **_Annotation:_**     | `datetime`                                                                             |
    | **_Literal Syntax:_** | See [Language Guide - Date](/lang-guide/chapters/types/basic_types/datetime.md)        |

    Simple example:

    ```nu
    date now
    # => Mon, 12 Aug 2024 13:59:22 -0400 (now)
    # Format as Unix epoch
    date now | format date '%s'
    # => 1723485562
    ```

    ### Durations

    |                       |                                                                                           |
    | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **_Description:_**    | Represent a unit of a passage of time                                                     |
    | **_Annotation:_**     | `duration`                                                                                |
    | **_Literal Syntax:_** | See [Language Reference - Duration](/lang-guide/chapters/types/basic_types/duration.html) |

    Durations support fractional values as well as calculations.

    Simple example:

    ```nu
    3.14day
    # => 3day 3hr 21min
    30day / 1sec  # How many seconds in 30 days?
    # => 2592000
    ```

    ### File sizes

    |                       |                                                                                           |
    | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **_Description:_**    | Specialized numeric type to represent the size of files or a number of bytes              |
    | **_Annotation:_**     | `filesize`                                                                                |
    | **_Literal Syntax:_** | See [Language Reference - Filesize](/lang-guide/chapters/types/basic_types/filesize.html) |

    Nushell also has a special type for file sizes.

    As with durations, Nushell supports fractional file sizes and calculations:

    ```nu
    0.5kB
    # => 500 B
    1GiB / 1B
    # => 1073741824
    (1GiB / 1B) == 2 ** 30
    # => true
    ```

    See the [Language Reference](/lang-guide/chapters/types/basic_types/filesize.html) for a complete list of units and more detail.

    ### Ranges

    |                       |                                                                                                |
    | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **_Description:_**    | Describes a range of values from a starting value to an ending value, with an optional stride. |
    | **_Annotation:_**     | `range`                                                                                        |
    | **_Literal Syntax:_** | `<start_value>..<end_value>`. E.g., `1..10`.                                                   |
    |                       | `<start_value>..<second_value>..<end_value>`. E.g., `2..4..20`                                 |
    | **_See also:_**       | [Language Guide - Range](/lang-guide/chapters/types/basic_types/range.md)                      |

    Simple example:

    ```nu
    1..5
    # => ╭───┬───╮
    # => │ 0 │ 1 │
    # => │ 1 │ 2 │
    # => │ 2 │ 3 │
    # => │ 3 │ 4 │
    # => │ 4 │ 5 │
    # => ╰───┴───╯
    ```

    ::: tip
    You can also easily create lists of characters with a form similar to ranges with the command [`seq char`](/commands/docs/seq_char.html) as well as with dates using the [`seq date`](/commands/docs/seq_date.html) command.

    ### Cell Paths

    |                       |                                                                                                                 |
    | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **_Description:_**    | An expression that is used to navigated to an inner value in a structured value.                                |
    | **_Annotation:_**     | `cell-path`                                                                                                     |
    | **_Literal syntax:_** | A dot-separated list of row (int) and column (string) IDs. E.g., `name.4.5`.                                    |
    |                       | Optionally, use a leading `$.` when needed for disambiguation, such as when assigning a cell-path to a variable |
    | **_See also:_**       | [Language Reference - Cell-path](/lang-guide/chapters/types/basic_types/cellpath.md)                            |
    |                       | [Navigating and Accessing Structured Data](/book/navigating_structured_data.md) chapter.                        |

    Simple example:

    ```nu
    let cp = $.2
    # Return list item at index 2
    [ foo bar goo glue ] | get $cp
    # => goo
    ```

    ### Closures

    |                       |                                                                                                                                                 |
    | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **_Description:_**    | An anonymous function, often called a lambda function, which accepts parameters and _closes over_ (i.e., uses) variables from outside its scope |
    | **_Annotation:_**     | `closure`                                                                                                                                       |
    | **_Literal Syntax:_** | `{\|args\| expressions }`                                                                                                                       |
    | **_See also:_**       | [Language Reference - Closure](/lang-guide/chapters/types/basic_types/closure.md)                                                               |

    Simple example:

    This closure returns a boolean result of the comparison and then uses it in a `filter` command to return all values greater than 5.

    ```nu
    let compare_closure = {|a| $a > 5 }
    let original_list = [ 40 -4 0 8 12 16 -16 ]
    $original_list | filter $compare_closure
    # => ╭───┬────╮
    # => │ 0 │ 40 │
    # => │ 1 │  8 │
    # => │ 2 │ 12 │
    # => │ 3 │ 16 │
    # => ╰───┴────╯
    ```

    Closures are a useful way to represent code that can be executed on each row of data via [filters](/lang-guide/chapters/filters/00_filters_overview.md)

    ### Binary data

    |                       |                                                                             |
    | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **_Description:_**    | Represents binary data                                                      |
    | **_Annotation:_**     | `binary`                                                                    |
    | **_Literal Syntax:_** | `0x[ffffffff]` - hex-based binary representation                            |
    |                       | `0o[1234567]` - octal-based binary representation                           |
    |                       | `0b[10101010101]` - binary-based binary representation                      |
    | **_See also:_**       | [Language Guide - Binary](/lang-guide/chapters/types/basic_types/binary.md) |

    Binary data, like the data from an image file, is a group of raw bytes.

    Simple example - Confirm that a JPEG file starts with the proper identifier:

    ```nu
    open nushell_logo.jpg
    | into binary
    | first 2
    | $in == 0x[ff d8]
    # => true
    ```

    ## Structured Data Types

    Nushell includes a collection of structured data types that can contain the primitive types above. For example, instead of a single `float`, structured data gives us a way to represent multiple `float` values, such as a `list` of temperature readings, in the same value. Nushell supports the following structured data types:

    | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **_Description:_** | A two-dimensional container with both columns and rows where each cell can hold any basic or structured data type |
    | **_Annotation:_**  | `table`                                                                                                           |

    The table is a core data structure in Nushell. As you run commands, you'll see that many of them return tables as output. A table has both rows and columns.

    :::tip
    Internally, tables are simply **lists of records**. This means that any command which extracts or isolates a specific row of a table will produce a record. For example, `get 0`, when used on a list, extracts the first value. But when used on a table (a list of records), it extracts a record:

    ```nu
    [{x:12, y:5}, {x:3, y:6}] | get 0
    # => ╭───┬────╮
    # => │ x │ 12 │
    # => │ y │ 5  │
    # => ╰───┴────╯
    ```

    Documentation text:

    # Parallelism

    Nushell now has early support for running code in parallel. This allows you to process elements of a stream using more hardware resources of your computer.

    You will notice these commands with their characteristic `par-` naming. Each corresponds to a non-parallel version, allowing you to easily write code in a serial style first, and then go back and easily convert serial scripts into parallel scripts with a few extra characters.

    ## par-each

    The most common parallel command is [`par-each`](/commands/docs/par-each.md), a companion to the [`each`](/commands/docs/each.md) command.

    Like [`each`](/commands/docs/each.md), [`par-each`](/commands/docs/par-each.md) works on each element in the pipeline as it comes in, running a block on each. Unlike [`each`](/commands/docs/each.md), [`par-each`](/commands/docs/par-each.md) will do these operations in parallel.

    Let's say you wanted to count the number of files in each sub-directory of the current directory. Using [`each`](/commands/docs/each.md), you could write this as:

    ```nu
    ls | where type == dir | each { |row|
        { name: $row.name, len: (ls $row.name | length) }
    }
    ```

    We create a record for each entry, and fill it with the name of the directory and the count of entries in that sub-directory.

    On your machine, the times may vary. For this machine, it took 21 milliseconds for the current directory.

    Now, since this operation can be run in parallel, let's convert the above to parallel by changing [`each`](/commands/docs/each.md) to [`par-each`](/commands/docs/par-each.md):

    ```nu
    ls | where type == dir | par-each { |row|
        { name: $row.name, len: (ls $row.name | length) }
    }
    ```

    On this machine, it now runs in 6ms. That's quite a difference!

    As a side note: Because [environment variables are scoped](environment.md#scoping), you can use [`par-each`](/commands/docs/par-each.md) to work in multiple directories in parallel (notice the [`cd`](/commands/docs/cd.md) command):

    ```nu
    ls | where type == dir | par-each { |row|
        { name: $row.name, len: (cd $row.name; ls | length) }
    }
    ```

    You'll notice, if you look at the results, that they come back in different orders each run (depending on the number of hardware threads on your system). As tasks finish, and we get the correct result, we may need to add additional steps if we want our results in a particular order. For example, for the above, we may want to sort the results by the "name" field. This allows both [`each`](/commands/docs/each.md) and [`par-each`](/commands/docs/par-each.md) versions of our script to give the same result.
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of parallelism in Nushell as described in the documentation?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user efficiently calculate the number of files in each sub-directory using par-each and what is the expected outcome?
  documentationQuestion3: What are the common use cases for using par-each in conjunction with environment variable scoping, and how does it affect the order of results?

    # Standard Library (Preview)

    Nushell ships with a standard library of useful commands written in native Nu. By default, the standard library is loaded into memory (but not automatically imported) when Nushell starts.

    [[toc]]

    ## Overview

    The standard library currently includes:

    - Assertions
    - An alternative `help` system with support for completions.
    - Additional JSON variant formats
    - XML Access
    - Logging
    - And more

    To see a complete list of the commands available in the standard library, run the following:

    ```nu
    nu -c "
      use std
      scope commands
      | where name =~ '^std '
      | select name description extra_description
      | wrap 'Standard Library Commands'
      | table -e
    "
    ```

    ::: note
    The `use std` command above loads the entire standard library so that you can see all of the commands at once. This is typically not how it will be used (more info below). It is also run in a separate Nu subshell simply so that it is not loaded into scope in the shell you are using.
    :::

    ## Importing the Standard Library

    The Standard Library modules and submodules are imported with the [`use`](/commands/docs/use.md) command, just as any other module. See [Using Modules](./modules/using_modules.md) for more information.

    While working at the commandline, it can be convenient to load the entire standard library using:

    ```nu
    use std *
    ```

    However, this form should be avoided in custom commands and scripts since it has the longest load time.

    ::: important Optimal Startup when Using the Standard Library
    See the [notes below](#optimal-startup) on how to ensure that your configuration isn't loading the entire Standard Library.
    :::

    ### Importing Submodules

    Each submodule of the standard library can be loaded separately. Again, _for best performance, load only the submodule(s) that you need in your code._

    See [Importing Modules](./modules/using_modules.md#importing-modules) for general information on using modules. The recommended import for each of the Standard Library submodules is listed below:

    #### 1. Submodules with `<command> <subcommand>` form

    These submodules are normally imported with `use std/<submodule>` (without a glob/`*`):

    - `use std/assert`: `assert` and its subcommands
    - `use std/bench`: The benchmarking command `bench`
    - `use std/dirs`: The directory stack command `dirs` and its subcommands
    - `use std/input`: The `input display` command
    - `use std/help`: An alternative version of the `help` command and its subcommands which supports completion and other features
    - `use std/iters`: Additional `iters`-prefixed iteration commands.
    - `use std/log`: The `log <subcommands>` such as `log warning <msg>`
    - `use std/math`: Mathematical constants such as `$math.E`. These can also be imported as definitions as in Form #2 below.

    #### 2. Import the _definitions_ (contents) of the module directly

    Some submodules are easier to use when their definitions (commands, aliases, constants, etc.) are loaded into the current scope. For instance:

    ```nu
    use std/formats *
    ls | to jsonl
    ```

    Submodules that are normally imported with `use std/<submodule> *` (**with** a glob/`*`):

    - `use std/dt *`: Additional commands for working with `date` values
    - `use std/formats *`: Additional `to` and `from` format conversions
    - `use std/math *`: The math constants without a prefix, such as `$E`. Note that the prefixed form #1 above is likely more understandable when reading and maintaining code.
    - `use std/xml *`: Additional commands for working with XML data

    #### 3. `use std <submodule>`

    It is _possible_ to import Standard Library submodules using a space-separated form:

    ```nu
    use std log
    use std formats *
    ```

    ::: important
    As mentioned in [Using Modules](./modules/using_modules.md#module-definitions), this form (like `use std *`) first loads the _entire_ Standard Library into scope and _then_ imports the submodules. In contrast, the slash-separated versions in #1 and #2 above _only_ import the submodule and will be much faster as a result.
    :::

    ## The Standard Library Candidate Module

    `std-rfc`, found in the [nushell Repository](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/tree/main/crates/nu-std/std-rfc), serves as a staging ground for possible Standard Library additions.

    If you are interested in adding to the Standard Library, please submit your code via PR to the `std-rfc` module in that repository. We also encourage you to install this module and provide feedback on upcoming candidate commands.

    ::: details More details

    Candidate commands for the Standard Library should, in general:

    - Have broad appeal - Be useful to a large number of users or use cases
    - Be well-written and clearly commented for future maintainers
    - Implement help comments with example usage
    - Have a description that explains why you feel the command should be a part of the standard library. Think of this as an "advertisement" of sorts to convince people to try the command and provide feedback so that it can be promoted in the future.

    In order for a command to be graduated from RFC to the Standard Library, it must have:

    - Positive feedback
    - Few (or no) outstanding issues and, of course, no significant issues
    - A PR author for the `std` submission. This does not necessarily have to be the original author of the command.
    - Test cases as part of the `std` submission PR

    Ultimately a member of the core team will decide when and if to merge the command into `std` based on these criteria.

    Of course, if a candidate command in `std-rfc` no longer works or has too many issues, it may be removed from or disabled in `std-rfc`.

    :::

    ## Disabling the Standard Library

    To disable the standard library, you can start Nushell using:

    ```nu
    nu --no-std-lib
    ```

    This can be especially useful to minimize overhead when running a command in a subshell using `nu -c`. For example:

    ```nu
    nu --no-std-lib -n -c "$nu.startup-time"
    # => 1ms 125µs 10ns

    nu -n -c "$nu.startup-time"
    # => 4ms 889µs 576ns
    ```

    You will not be able to import the library, any of its submodules, nor use any of its commands, when it is disabled in this way.

    ## Using `std/log` in Modules

    ::: warning Important!
    `std/log` exports environment variables. To use the `std/log` module in your own module, please see [this caveat](./modules/creating_modules.md#export-env-runs-only-when-the-use-call-is-evaluated) in the "Creating Modules" Chapter.

    :::

    ## Optimal Startup

    If Nushell's startup time is important to your workflow, review your [startup configuration]([./configuration.md]) in `config.nu`, `env.nu`, and potentially others for inefficient use of the standard library. The following command should identify any problem areas:

    ```nu
    view files
    | enumerate | flatten
    | where filename !~ '^std'
    | where filename !~ '^entry'
    | where {|file|
        (view span $file.start $file.end) =~ 'use\W+std[^\/]'
      }
    ```

    Edit those files to use the recommended syntax in the [Importing Submodules](#importing-submodules) section above.

    ::: note
    If a Nushell library (e.g., from [the `nu_scripts` repository](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts)), example, or doc is using this syntax, please report it via an issue or PR. These will be updated over time after Nushell 0.99.0 is released.

    If a third-party module is using this syntax, please report it to the author/maintainers to update.

This allows you to confirm\nthe substitution and, if needed, make additional edits before execution.\n\nThis behavior extends to \"Edit command-line in Editor\" as well. While Bash immediately\nexecutes the command after exiting the editor, Nushell (like other, more modern shells\nsuch as Fish and Zsh) inserts the editor contents into the command-line, allowing you\nto review and make changes before committing it to execution.\n:::"
  documentationQuestion1: What are the primary purposes of the command equivalents provided in the Nushell documentation for users transitioning from Bash?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user configure the Git Bash environment in Nushell to make external commands like `ln`, `grep`, and `vi` available by default?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the most common use case for using the `ls` command with pattern matching in Nushell, and how is it typically implemented?

    ## Forwarded CMD.EXE commands

    Nu accepts and runs *some* of CMD.EXE's internal commands through `cmd.exe`.

    The internal commands are: `ASSOC`, `CLS`, `ECHO`, `FTYPE`, `MKLINK`, `PAUSE`, `START`, `VER`, `VOL`

    These internal commands take precedence over external commands.

    For example, with a `ver.bat` file in the current working directory, executing `^ver` executes CMD.EXE's internal `VER` command, *NOT* the `ver.bat` file.

    Executing `./ver` or `ver.bat` *will* execute the local bat file though.

    Note that Nushell has its own [`start` command](/commands/docs/start.md) which takes precedence.
    You can call the CMD.EXE's internal `START` command with the external command syntax `^start`.

    # Dataframes

    ::: warning Important!
    This feature requires the Polars plugin.  See the
    [Plugins Chapter](plugins.md) to learn how to install it.

    To test that this plugin is properly installed, run `help polars`.
    :::

    As we have seen so far, Nushell makes working with data its main priority.
    `Lists` and `Tables` are there to help you cycle through values in order to
    perform multiple operations or find data in a breeze. However, there are
    certain operations where a row-based data layout is not the most efficient way
    to process data, especially when working with extremely large files. Operations
    like group-by or join using large datasets can be costly memory-wise, and may
    lead to large computation times if they are not done using the appropriate
    data format.

    For this reason, the `DataFrame` structure was introduced to Nushell. A
    `DataFrame` stores its data in a columnar format using as its base the [Apache
    Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) specification, and uses
    [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) as the motor for performing
    extremely [fast columnar operations](https://h2oai.github.io/db-benchmark/).

    You may be wondering now how fast this combo could be, and how could it make
    working with data easier and more reliable. For this reason, we'll start this
    chapter by presenting benchmarks on common operations that are done when
    processing data.

    ## Benchmark Comparisons

    For this little benchmark exercise we will be comparing native Nushell
    commands, dataframe Nushell commands and [Python
    Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) commands. For the time being don't pay too
    much attention to the [`Dataframe` commands](/commands/categories/dataframe.md). They will be explained in later
    sections of this page.

    ::: tip System Details
    The benchmarks presented in this section were run using a Macbook with a processor M1 pro and 32gb of ram. All examples were run on Nushell version 0.97 using `nu_plugin_polars 0.97`.
    :::

    ### File Information

    The file that we will be using for the benchmarks is the
    [New Zealand business demography](https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/New-Zealand-business-demography-statistics/New-Zealand-business-demography-statistics-At-February-2020/Download-data/Geographic-units-by-industry-and-statistical-area-2000-2020-descending-order-CSV.zip) dataset.
    Feel free to download it if you want to follow these tests.

    The dataset has 5 columns and 5,429,252 rows. We can check that by using the
    `polars store-ls` command:

    ```nu
    let df_0 = polars open --eager Data7602DescendingYearOrder.csv
    polars store-ls | select key type columns rows estimated_size
    # => ╭──────────────────────────────────────┬───────────┬─────────┬─────────┬────────────────╮
    # => │                 key                  │   type    │ columns │  rows   │ estimated_size │
    # => ├──────────────────────────────────────┼───────────┼─────────┼─────────┼────────────────┤
    # => │ b2519dac-3b64-4e5d-a0d7-24bde9052dc7 │ DataFrame │       5 │ 5429252 │       184.5 MB │
    # => ╰──────────────────────────────────────┴───────────┴─────────┴─────────┴────────────────╯
    ```

    ::: tip
    As of nushell 0.97, `polars open` will open as a lazy dataframe instead of a eager dataframe.
    To open as an eager dataframe, use the `--eager` flag.
    :::

    We can have a look at the first lines of the file using [`first`](/commands/docs/first.md):

    ```nu
    $df_0 | polars first
    # => ╭───┬──────────┬─────────┬──────┬───────────┬──────────╮
    # => │ # │ anzsic06 │  Area   │ year │ geo_count │ ec_count │
    # => ├───┼──────────┼─────────┼──────┼───────────┼──────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ A        │ A100100 │ 2000 │        96 │      130 │
    # => ╰───┴──────────┴─────────┴──────┴───────────┴──────────╯
    ```

    ...and finally, we can get an idea of the inferred data types:

    ```nu
    $df_0 | polars schema
    # => ╭───────────┬─────╮
    # => │ anzsic06  │ str │
    # => │ Area      │ str │
    # => │ year      │ i64 │
    # => │ geo_count │ i64 │
    # => │ ec_count  │ i64 │
    # => ╰───────────┴─────╯
    ```

    ### Group-by Comparison

    To output more statistically correct timings, let's load and use the `std bench` command.

    ```nu
    use std/bench
    ```

    We are going to group the data by year, and sum the column `geo_count`.

    First, let's measure the performance of a Nushell native commands pipeline.

    ```nu
    bench -n 10 --pretty {
        open 'Data7602DescendingYearOrder.csv'
        | group-by year --to-table
        | update items {|i|
            $i.items.geo_count
            | math sum
        }
    }
    # => 3sec 268ms +/- 50ms
    ```

    So, 3.3 seconds to perform this aggregation.

    Let's try the same operation in pandas:

    ```nu
    ('import pandas as pd

    df = pd.read_csv("Data7602DescendingYearOrder.csv")
    res = df.groupby("year")["geo_count"].sum()
    print(res)'
    | save load.py -f)
    ```

    And the result from the benchmark is:

    ```nu
    bench -n 10 --pretty {
        python load.py | complete | null
    }
    # => 1sec 322ms +/- 6ms
    ```

    Not bad at all. Pandas managed to get it 2.6 times faster than Nushell.
    And with bigger files, the superiority of Pandas should increase here.

    To finish the comparison, let's try Nushell dataframes. We are going to put
    all the operations in one `nu` file, to make sure we are doing the correct
    comparison:

    ```nu
    ( 'polars open Data7602DescendingYearOrder.csv
        | polars group-by year
        | polars agg (polars col geo_count | polars sum)
        | polars collect'
    | save load.nu -f )
    ```

    and the benchmark with dataframes (together with loading a new nushell and `polars`
    instance for each test in order of honest comparison) is:

    ```nu
    bench -n 10 --pretty {
        nu load.nu | complete | null
    }
    # => 135ms +/- 4ms
    ```

    The `polars` dataframes plugin managed to finish operation 10 times
    faster than `pandas` with python. Isn't that great?

    As you can see, the Nushell's `polars` plugin is performant like `polars` itself.
    Coupled with Nushell commands and pipelines, it is capable of conducting sophisticated
    analysis without leaving the terminal.

    Let's clean up the cache from the dataframes that we used during benchmarking.
    To do that, let's stop the `polars`.
    When we execute our next commands, we will start a new instance of plugin.

    ```nu
    plugin stop polars
    ```

    ## Working with Dataframes

    After seeing a glimpse of the things that can be done with [`Dataframe` commands](/commands/categories/dataframe.md),
    now it is time to start testing them. To begin let's create a sample
    CSV file that will become our sample dataframe that we will be using along with
    the examples. In your favorite file editor paste the next lines to create out
    sample csv file.

    ```nu
    ("int_1,int_2,float_1,float_2,first,second,third,word
    1,11,0.1,1.0,a,b,c,first
    2,12,0.2,1.0,a,b,c,second
    3,13,0.3,2.0,a,b,c,third
    4,14,0.4,3.0,b,a,c,second
    0,15,0.5,4.0,b,a,a,third
    6,16,0.6,5.0,b,a,a,second
    7,17,0.7,6.0,b,c,a,third
    8,18,0.8,7.0,c,c,b,eight
    9,19,0.9,8.0,c,c,b,ninth
    0,10,0.0,9.0,c,c,b,ninth"
    | save --raw --force test_small.csv)
    ```

    Save the file and name it however you want to, for the sake of these examples
    the file will be called `test_small.csv`.

    Now, to read that file as a dataframe use the `polars open` command like
    this:

    ```nu
    let df_1 = polars open --eager test_small.csv
    ```

    This should create the value `$df_1` in memory which holds the data we just
    created.

    ::: tip
    The `polars open` command can read files in formats: **csv**, **tsv**, **parquet**, **json(l)**, **arrow**, and **avro**.
    :::

    To see all the dataframes that are stored in memory you can use

    ```nu
    polars store-ls | select key type columns rows estimated_size
    # => ╭──────────────────────────────────────┬───────────┬─────────┬──────┬────────────────╮
    # => │                 key                  │   type    │ columns │ rows │ estimated_size │
    # => ├──────────────────────────────────────┼───────────┼─────────┼──────┼────────────────┤
    # => │ e780af47-c106-49eb-b38d-d42d3946d66e │ DataFrame │       8 │   10 │          403 B │
    # => ╰──────────────────────────────────────┴───────────┴─────────┴──────┴────────────────╯
    ```

    As you can see, the command shows the created dataframes together with basic
    information about them.

    And if you want to see a preview of the loaded dataframe you can send the
    dataframe variable to the stream

    ```nu
    $df_1
    # => ╭───┬───────┬───────┬─────────┬─────────┬───────┬────────┬───────┬────────╮
    # => │ # │ int_1 │ int_2 │ float_1 │ float_2 │ first │ second │ third │  word  │
    # => ├───┼───────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼───────┼────────┼───────┼────────┤
    # => │ 0 │     1 │    11 │    0.10 │    1.00 │ a     │ b      │ c     │ first  │
    # => │ 1 │     2 │    12 │    0.20 │    1.00 │ a     │ b      │ c     │ second │
    # => │ 2 │     3 │    13 │    0.30 │    2.00 │ a     │ b      │ c     │ third  │
    # => │ 3 │     4 │    14 │    0.40 │    3.00 │ b     │ a      │ c     │ second │
    # => │ 4 │     0 │    15 │    0.50 │    4.00 │ b     │ a      │ a     │ third  │
    # => │ 5 │     6 │    16 │    0.60 │    5.00 │ b     │ a      │ a     │ second │
    # => │ 6 │     7 │    17 │    0.70 │    6.00 │ b     │ c      │ a     │ third  │
    # => │ 7 │     8 │    18 │    0.80 │    7.00 │ c     │ c      │ b     │ eight  │
    # => │ 8 │     9 │    19 │    0.90 │    8.00 │ c     │ c      │ b     │ ninth  │
    # => │ 9 │     0 │    10 │    0.00 │    9.00 │ c     │ c      │ b     │ ninth  │
    # => ╰───┴───────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────┴───────┴────────┴───────┴────────╯
    ```

    With the dataframe in memory we can start doing column operations with the
    `DataFrame`

    ::: tip
    If you want to see all the dataframe commands that are available you
    can use `scope commands | where category =~ dataframe`

    ## Basic Aggregations

    Let's start with basic aggregations on the dataframe. Let's sum all the columns
    that exist in `df` by using the `aggregate` command

    ```nu
    $df_1 | polars sum | polars collect
    # => ╭───┬───────┬───────┬─────────┬─────────┬───────┬────────┬───────┬──────╮
    # => │ # │ int_1 │ int_2 │ float_1 │ float_2 │ first │ second │ third │ word │
    # => ├───┼───────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼───────┼────────┼───────┼──────┤
    # => │ 0 │    40 │   145 │    4.50 │   46.00 │       │        │       │      │
    # => ╰───┴───────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────┴───────┴────────┴───────┴──────╯
    ```

    As you can see, the aggregate function computes the sum for those columns where
    a sum makes sense. If you want to filter out the text column, you can select
    the columns you want by using the [`polars select`](/commands/docs/polars_select.md) command

    ```nu
    $df_1 | polars sum | polars select int_1 int_2 float_1 float_2 | polars collect
    # => ╭───┬───────┬───────┬─────────┬─────────╮
    # => │ # │ int_1 │ int_2 │ float_1 │ float_2 │
    # => ├───┼───────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┤
    # => │ 0 │    40 │   145 │    4.50 │   46.00 │
    # => ╰───┴───────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────╯
    ```

    You can even store the result from this aggregation as you would store any
    other Nushell variable

    ```nu
    let res = $df_1 | polars sum | polars select int_1 int_2 float_1 float_2
    ```

    ::: tip
    Type `let res = !!` and press enter. This will auto complete the previously
    executed command. Note the space between `=` and `!!`.
    :::

    And now we have two dataframes stored in memory

    ```nu
    polars store-ls | select key type columns rows estimated_size
    ╭──────────────────────────────────────┬───────────┬─────────┬──────┬────────────────╮
    │                 key                  │   type    │ columns │ rows │ estimated_size │
    ├──────────────────────────────────────┼───────────┼─────────┼──────┼────────────────┤
    │ e780af47-c106-49eb-b38d-d42d3946d66e │ DataFrame │       8 │   10 │          403 B │
    │ 3146f4c1-f2a0-475b-a623-7375c1fdb4a7 │ DataFrame │       4 │    1 │           32 B │
    ╰──────────────────────────────────────┴───────────┴─────────┴──────┴────────────────╯
    ```

    Pretty neat, isn't it?

    You can perform several aggregations on the dataframe in order to extract basic
    information from the dataframe and do basic data analysis on your brand new
    dataframe.

    ## Joining a DataFrame

    It is also possible to join two dataframes using a column as reference. We are
    going to join our mini dataframe with another mini dataframe. Copy these lines
    in another file and create the corresponding dataframe (for these examples we
    are going to call it `test_small_a.csv`)

    ```nu
    "int_1,int_2,float_1,float_2,first
    9,14,0.4,3.0,a
    8,13,0.3,2.0,a
    7,12,0.2,1.0,a
    6,11,0.1,0.0,b"
    | save --raw --force test_small_a.csv
    ```

    We use the `polars open` command to create the new variable

    ```nu
    let df_2 = polars open --eager test_small_a.csv
    ```

    Now, with the second dataframe loaded in memory we can join them using the
    column called `int_1` from the left dataframe and the column `int_1` from the
    right dataframe

    ```nu
    $df_1 | polars join $df_2 int_1 int_1
    # => ╭───┬───────┬───────┬─────────┬─────────┬───────┬────────┬───────┬────────┬─────────┬───────────┬───────────┬─────────╮
    # => │ # │ int_1 │ int_2 │ float_1 │ float_2 │ first │ second │ third │  word  │ int_2_x │ float_1_x │ float_2_x │ first_x │
    # => ├───┼───────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼───────┼────────┼───────┼────────┼─────────┼───────────┼───────────┼─────────┤

    ```

    ::: tip
    In `Nu` when a command has multiple arguments that are expecting
    multiple values we use brackets `[]` to enclose those values. In the case of
    [`polars join`](/commands/docs/polars_join.md) we can join on multiple columns
    as long as they have the same type.
    :::

    For example:

    ```nu
    $df_1 | polars join $df_2 [int_1 first] [int_1 first]
    # => ╭───┬───────┬───────┬─────────┬─────────┬───────┬────────┬───────┬────────┬─────────┬───────────┬───────────╮
    # => │ # │ int_1 │ int_2 │ float_1 │ float_2 │ first │ second │ third │  word  │ int_2_x │ float_1_x │ float_2_x │
    # => ├───┼───────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼───────┼────────┼───────┼────────┼─────────┼───────────┼───────────┤
    # => │ 0 │     6 │    16 │    0.60 │    5.00 │ b     │ a      │ a     │ second │      11 │      0.10 │      0.00 │
    # => ╰───┴───────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────┴───────┴────────┴───────┴────────┴─────────┴───────────┴───────────╯
    ```

    By default, the join command does an inner join, meaning that it will keep the
    rows where both dataframes share the same value. You can select a left join to
    keep the missing rows from the left dataframe. You can also save this result
    in order to use it for further operations.

    ## DataFrame group-by

    One of the most powerful operations that can be performed with a DataFrame is
    the [`polars group-by`](/commands/docs/polars_group-by.md). This command will allow you to perform aggregation operations
    based on a grouping criteria. In Nushell, a `GroupBy` is a type of object that
    can be stored and reused for multiple aggregations. This is quite handy, since
    the creation of the grouped pairs is the most expensive operation while doing
    group-by and there is no need to repeat it if you are planning to do multiple
    operations with the same group condition.

    To create a `GroupBy` object you only need to use the [`polars_group-by`](/commands/docs/polars_group-by.md) command

    ```nu
    let group = $df_1 | polars group-by first
    $group
    # => ╭─────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────╮
    # => │ LazyGroupBy │ apply aggregation to complete execution plan │
    # => ╰─────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────╯
    ```

    When printing the `GroupBy` object we can see that it is in the background a
    lazy operation waiting to be completed by adding an aggregation. Using the
    `GroupBy` we can create aggregations on a column

    ```nu
    $group | polars agg (polars col int_1 | polars sum)
    # => ╭────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
    # => │ plan           │ AGGREGATE                                                                             │
    # => │                │     [col("int_1").sum()] BY [col("first")] FROM                                       │
    # => │                │   DF ["int_1", "int_2", "float_1", "float_2"]; PROJECT */8 COLUMNS; SELECTION: "None" │
    # => │ optimized_plan │ AGGREGATE                                                                             │
    # => │                │     [col("int_1").sum()] BY [col("first")] FROM                                       │
    # => │                │   DF ["int_1", "int_2", "float_1", "float_2"]; PROJECT 2/8 COLUMNS; SELECTION: "None" │
    # => ╰────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
    ```

    or we can define multiple aggregations on the same or different columns

    ```nu
    $group
    | polars agg [
        (polars col int_1 | polars n-unique)
        (polars col int_2 | polars min)
        (polars col float_1 | polars sum)
        (polars col float_2 | polars count)
    ] | polars sort-by first
    # => ╭────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮

    ## Creating Dataframes

    It is also possible to construct dataframes from basic Nushell primitives, such
    as integers, decimals, or strings. Let's create a small dataframe using the
    command `polars into-df`.

    ```nu
    let df_3 = [[a b]; [1 2] [3 4] [5 6]] | polars into-df
    $df_3
    # => ╭───┬───┬───╮
    # => │ # │ a │ b │
    # => ├───┼───┼───┤
    # => │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │
    # => │ 1 │ 3 │ 4 │
    # => │ 2 │ 5 │ 6 │
    # => ╰───┴───┴───╯
    ```

    ::: tip
    For the time being, not all of Nushell primitives can be converted into
    a dataframe. This will change in the future, as the dataframe feature matures
    :::

    We can append columns to a dataframe in order to create a new variable. As an
    example, let's append two columns to our mini dataframe `$df_3`

    ```nu
    let df_4 = $df_3 | polars with-column $df_3.a --name a2 | polars with-column $df_3.a --name a3
    $df_4
    # => ╭───┬───┬───┬────┬────╮
    # => │ # │ a │ b │ a2 │ a3 │
    # => ├───┼───┼───┼────┼────┤
    # => │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │  1 │  1 │
    # => │ 1 │ 3 │ 4 │  3 │  3 │
    # => │ 2 │ 5 │ 6 │  5 │  5 │
    # => ╰───┴───┴───┴────┴────╯
    ```

    Nushell's powerful piping syntax allows us to create new dataframes by
    taking data from other dataframes and appending it to them. Now, if you list your
    dataframes you will see in total five dataframes

    ```nu
    polars store-ls | select key type columns rows estimated_size
    # => ╭──────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────┬─────────┬──────┬────────────────╮
    # => │                 key                  │    type     │ columns │ rows │ estimated_size │

    # => ╰──────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────┴─────────┴──────┴────────────────╯
    ```

    One thing that is important to mention is how the memory is being optimized
    while working with dataframes, and this is thanks to **Apache Arrow** and
    **Polars**. In a very simple representation, each column in a DataFrame is an
    Arrow Array, which is using several memory specifications in order to maintain
    the data as packed as possible (check [Arrow columnar
    format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html)). The other
    optimization trick is the fact that whenever possible, the columns from the
    dataframes are shared between dataframes, avoiding memory duplication for the
    same data. This means that dataframes `$df_3` and `$df_4` are sharing the same two
    columns we created using the `polars into-df` command. For this reason, it isn't
    possible to change the value of a column in a dataframe. However, you can
    create new columns based on data from other columns or dataframes.

    ## Working with Series

    A `Series` is the building block of a `DataFrame`. Each Series represents a
    column with the same data type, and we can create multiple Series of different
    types, such as float, int or string.

    Let's start our exploration with Series by creating one using the `polars into-df`
    command:

    ```nu
    let df_5 = [9 8 4] | polars into-df
    $df_5
    # => ╭───┬───╮
    # => │ # │ 0 │
    # => ├───┼───┤
    # => │ 0 │ 9 │
    # => │ 1 │ 8 │
    # => │ 2 │ 4 │
    # => ╰───┴───╯
    ```

    We have created a new series from a list of integers (we could have done the
    same using floats or strings)

    Series have their own basic operations defined, and they can be used to create
    other Series. Let's create a new Series by doing some arithmetic on the
    previously created column.

    ```nu
    let df_6 = $df_5 * 3 + 10
    $df_6
    # => ╭───┬────╮
    # => │ # │ 0  │
    # => ├───┼────┤
    # => │ 0 │ 37 │
    # => │ 1 │ 34 │
    # => │ 2 │ 22 │
    # => ╰───┴────╯
    ```

    Now we have a new Series that was constructed by doing basic operations on the
    previous variable.

    ::: tip
    If you want to see how many variables you have stored in memory you can
    use `scope variables`
    :::

    Let's rename our previous Series so it has a memorable name

    ```nu
    let df_7 = $df_6 | polars rename "0" memorable
    $df_7
    # => ╭───┬───────────╮
    # => │ # │ memorable │
    # => ├───┼───────────┤
    # => │ 0 │        37 │
    # => │ 1 │        34 │
    # => │ 2 │        22 │
    # => ╰───┴───────────╯
    ```

    We can also do basic operations with two Series as long as they have the same
    data type

    ```nu
    $df_5 - $df_7
    # => ╭───┬─────────────────╮
    # => │ # │ sub_0_memorable │
    # => ├───┼─────────────────┤
    # => │ 0 │             -28 │
    # => │ 1 │             -26 │
    # => │ 2 │             -18 │
    # => ╰───┴─────────────────╯
    ```

    And we can add them to previously defined dataframes

    ```nu
    let df_8 = $df_3 | polars with-column $df_5 --name new_col
    $df_8
    # => ╭───┬───┬───┬─────────╮
    # => │ # │ a │ b │ new_col │
    # => ├───┼───┼───┼─────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │       9 │
    # => │ 1 │ 3 │ 4 │       8 │
    # => │ 2 │ 5 │ 6 │       4 │
    # => ╰───┴───┴───┴─────────╯
    ```

    The Series stored in a Dataframe can also be used directly, for example,
    we can multiply columns `a` and `b` to create a new Series

    ```nu
    $df_8.a * $df_8.b
    # => ╭───┬─────────╮
    # => │ # │ mul_a_b │
    # => ├───┼─────────┤
    # => │ 0 │       2 │
    # => │ 1 │      12 │
    # => │ 2 │      30 │
    # => ╰───┴─────────╯
    ```

    and we can start piping things in order to create new columns and dataframes

    ```nu
    let df_9 = $df_8 | polars with-column ($df_8.a * $df_8.b / $df_8.new_col) --name my_sum
    $df_9
    # => ╭───┬───┬───┬─────────┬────────╮
    # => │ # │ a │ b │ new_col │ my_sum │
    # => ├───┼───┼───┼─────────┼────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │       9 │      0 │
    # => │ 1 │ 3 │ 4 │       8 │      1 │
    # => │ 2 │ 5 │ 6 │       4 │      7 │
    # => ╰───┴───┴───┴─────────┴────────╯
    ```

    Nushell's piping system can help you create very interesting workflows.

    ## Series and Masks

    Series have another key use in when working with `DataFrames`, and it is the fact
    that we can build boolean masks out of them. Let's start by creating a simple
    mask using the equality operator

    ```nu
    let mask_0 = $df_5 == 8
    $mask_0
    # => ╭───┬───────╮
    # => │ # │   0   │
    # => ├───┼───────┤
    # => │ 0 │ false │
    # => │ 1 │ true  │
    # => │ 2 │ false │
    # => ╰───┴───────╯
    ```

    and with this mask we can now filter a dataframe, like this

    ```nu
    $df_9 | polars filter-with $mask_0
    # => ╭───┬───┬───┬─────────┬────────╮
    # => │ # │ a │ b │ new_col │ my_sum │
    # => ├───┼───┼───┼─────────┼────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ 3 │ 4 │       8 │      1 │
    # => ╰───┴───┴───┴─────────┴────────╯
    ```

    Now we have a new dataframe with only the values where the mask was true.

    The masks can also be created from Nushell lists, for example:

    ```nu
    let mask_1 = [true true false] | polars into-df
    $df_9 | polars filter-with $mask_1
    # => ╭───┬───┬───┬─────────┬────────╮
    # => │ # │ a │ b │ new_col │ my_sum │
    # => ├───┼───┼───┼─────────┼────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ 1 │ 2 │       9 │      0 │
    # => │ 1 │ 3 │ 4 │       8 │      1 │
    # => ╰───┴───┴───┴─────────┴────────╯
    ```

    To create complex masks, we have the `AND`

    ```nu
    $mask_0 and $mask_1
    # => ╭───┬─────────╮
    # => │ # │ and_0_0 │
    # => ├───┼─────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ false   │
    # => │ 1 │ true    │
    # => │ 2 │ false   │
    # => ╰───┴─────────╯
    ```

    and `OR` operations

    ```nu
    $mask_0 or $mask_1
    # => ╭───┬────────╮
    # => │ # │ or_0_0 │
    # => ├───┼────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ true   │
    # => │ 1 │ true   │
    # => │ 2 │ false  │
    # => ╰───┴────────╯
    ```

    We can also create a mask by checking if some values exist in other Series.
    Using the first dataframe that we created we can do something like this

    ```nu
    let mask_2 = $df_1 | polars col first | polars is-in [b c]
    $mask_2
    # => ╭──────────┬─────────────────────────╮
    # => │ input    │ [table 2 rows]          │
    # => │ function │ Boolean(IsIn)           │
    # => │ options  │ FunctionOptions { ... } │
    # => ╰──────────┴─────────────────────────╯
    ```

    and this new mask can be used to filter the dataframe

    ```nu
    $df_1 | polars filter-with $mask_2

    Another operation that can be done with masks is setting or replacing a value
    from a series. For example, we can change the value in the column `first` where
    the value is equal to `a`

    ```nu
    $df_1 | polars get first | polars set new --mask ($df_1.first =~ a)

    ## Series as Indices

    Series can be also used as a way of filtering a dataframe by using them as a
    list of indices. For example, let's say that we want to get rows 1, 4, and 6
    from our original dataframe. With that in mind, we can use the next command to
    extract that information

    ```nu
    let indices_0 = [1 4 6] | polars into-df
    $df_1 | polars take $indices_0
    # => ╭───┬───────┬───────┬─────────┬─────────┬───────┬────────┬───────┬────────╮
    # => │ # │ int_1 │ int_2 │ float_1 │ float_2 │ first │ second │ third │  word  │
    # => ├───┼───────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼───────┼────────┼───────┼────────┤
    # => │ 0 │     2 │    12 │    0.20 │    1.00 │ a     │ b      │ c     │ second │
    # => │ 1 │     0 │    15 │    0.50 │    4.00 │ b     │ a      │ a     │ third  │
    # => │ 2 │     7 │    17 │    0.70 │    6.00 │ b     │ c      │ a     │ third  │
    # => ╰───┴───────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────┴───────┴────────┴───────┴────────╯
    ```

    The command [`polars take`](/commands/docs/polars_take.md) is very handy, especially if we mix it with other commands.
    Let's say that we want to extract all rows for the first duplicated element for
    column `first`. In order to do that, we can use the command `polars arg-unique` as
    shown in the next example

    ```nu
    let indices_1 = $df_1 | polars get first | polars arg-unique
    $df_1 | polars take $indices_1
    # => ╭───┬───────┬───────┬─────────┬─────────┬───────┬────────┬───────┬────────╮
    # => │ # │ int_1 │ int_2 │ float_1 │ float_2 │ first │ second │ third │  word  │
    # => ├───┼───────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼───────┼────────┼───────┼────────┤
    # => │ 0 │     1 │    11 │    0.10 │    1.00 │ a     │ b      │ c     │ first  │
    # => │ 1 │     4 │    14 │    0.40 │    3.00 │ b     │ a      │ c     │ second │
    # => │ 2 │     8 │    18 │    0.80 │    7.00 │ c     │ c      │ b     │ eight  │
    # => ╰───┴───────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────┴───────┴────────┴───────┴────────╯
    ```

    Or what if we want to create a new sorted dataframe using a column in specific.
    We can use the `arg-sort` to accomplish that. In the next example we
    can sort the dataframe by the column `word`

    ::: tip
    The same result could be accomplished using the command [`sort`](/commands/docs/sort.md)
    :::

    ```nu
    let indices_2 = $df_1 | polars get word | polars arg-sort
    $df_1 | polars take $indices_2
    # => ╭───┬───────┬───────┬─────────┬─────────┬───────┬────────┬───────┬────────╮
    # => │ # │ int_1 │ int_2 │ float_1 │ float_2 │ first │ second │ third │  word  │
    # => ├───┼───────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼───────┼────────┼───────┼────────┤
    # => │ 0 │     8 │    18 │    0.80 │    7.00 │ c     │ c      │ b     │ eight  │
    # => │ 1 │     1 │    11 │    0.10 │    1.00 │ a     │ b      │ c     │ first  │
    # => │ 2 │     9 │    19 │    0.90 │    8.00 │ c     │ c      │ b     │ ninth  │
    # => │ 3 │     0 │    10 │    0.00 │    9.00 │ c     │ c      │ b     │ ninth  │
    # => │ 4 │     2 │    12 │    0.20 │    1.00 │ a     │ b      │ c     │ second │
    # => │ 5 │     4 │    14 │    0.40 │    3.00 │ b     │ a      │ c     │ second │
    # => │ 6 │     6 │    16 │    0.60 │    5.00 │ b     │ a      │ a     │ second │
    # => │ 7 │     3 │    13 │    0.30 │    2.00 │ a     │ b      │ c     │ third  │
    # => │ 8 │     0 │    15 │    0.50 │    4.00 │ b     │ a      │ a     │ third  │
    # => │ 9 │     7 │    17 │    0.70 │    6.00 │ b     │ c      │ a     │ third  │
    # => ╰───┴───────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────┴───────┴────────┴───────┴────────╯
    ```

    And finally, we can create new Series by setting a new value in the marked
    indices. Have a look at the next command

    ```nu
    let indices_3 = [0 2] | polars into-df
    $df_1 | polars get int_1 | polars set-with-idx 123 --indices $indices_3
    # => ╭───┬───────╮

    ## Unique Values

    Another operation that can be done with `Series` is to search for unique values
    in a list or column. Lets use again the first dataframe we created to test
    these operations.

    The first and most common operation that we have is `value_counts`. This
    command calculates a count of the unique values that exist in a Series. For
    example, we can use it to count how many occurrences we have in the column
    `first`

    ```nu
    $df_1 | polars get first | polars value-counts
    # => ╭───┬───────┬───────╮
    # => │ # │ first │ count │
    # => ├───┼───────┼───────┤
    # => │ 0 │ a     │     3 │
    # => │ 1 │ b     │     4 │
    # => │ 2 │ c     │     3 │
    # => ╰───┴───────┴───────╯
    ```

    As expected, the command returns a new dataframe that can be used to do more
    queries.

    Continuing with our exploration of `Series`, the next thing that we can do is
    to only get the unique unique values from a series, like this

    ```nu
    $df_1 | polars get first | polars unique
    # => ╭───┬───────╮
    # => │ # │ first │
    # => ├───┼───────┤
    # => │ 0 │ a     │
    # => │ 1 │ b     │
    # => │ 2 │ c     │
    # => ╰───┴───────╯
    ```

    Or we can get a mask that we can use to filter out the rows where data is
    unique or duplicated. For example, we can select the rows for unique values
    in column `word`

    ```nu
    $df_1 | polars filter-with ($in.word | polars is-unique)
    # => ╭───┬───────┬───────┬─────────┬─────────┬───────┬────────┬───────┬───────╮
    # => │ # │ int_1 │ int_2 │ float_1 │ float_2 │ first │ second │ third │ word  │
    # => ├───┼───────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼───────┼────────┼───────┼───────┤
    # => │ 0 │     1 │    11 │    0.10 │    1.00 │ a     │ b      │ c     │ first │
    # => │ 1 │     8 │    18 │    0.80 │    7.00 │ c     │ c      │ b     │ eight │
    # => ╰───┴───────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────┴───────┴────────┴───────┴───────╯
    ```

    Or all the duplicated ones

    ```nu
    $df_1 | polars filter-with ($in.word | polars is-duplicated)
    # => ╭───┬───────┬───────┬─────────┬─────────┬───────┬────────┬───────┬────────╮

    ## Lazy Dataframes

    Lazy dataframes are a way to query data by creating a logical plan. The
    advantage of this approach is that the plan never gets evaluated until you need
    to extract data. This way you could chain together aggregations, joins and
    selections and collect the data once you are happy with the selected
    operations.

    Let's create a small example of a lazy dataframe

    ```nu
    let lf_0 = [[a b]; [1 a] [2 b] [3 c] [4 d]] | polars into-lazy
    $lf_0
    # => ╭────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
    # => │ plan           │ DF ["a", "b"]; PROJECT */2 COLUMNS; SELECTION: "None" │
    # => │ optimized_plan │ DF ["a", "b"]; PROJECT */2 COLUMNS; SELECTION: "None" │
    # => ╰────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
    ```

    As you can see, the resulting dataframe is not yet evaluated, it stays as a
    set of instructions that can be done on the data. If you were to collect that
    dataframe you would get the next result

    ```nu
    $lf_0 | polars collect
    # => ╭───┬───┬───╮
    # => │ # │ a │ b │
    # => ├───┼───┼───┤
    # => │ 0 │ 1 │ a │
    # => │ 1 │ 2 │ b │
    # => │ 2 │ 3 │ c │
    # => │ 3 │ 4 │ d │
    # => ╰───┴───┴───╯
    ```

    as you can see, the collect command executes the plan and creates a nushell
    table for you.

    All dataframes operations should work with eager or lazy dataframes. They are
    converted in the background for compatibility. However, to take advantage of
    lazy operations if is recommended to only use lazy operations with lazy
    dataframes.

    To find all lazy dataframe operations you can use

    ```nu no-run
    scope commands | where category =~ lazyframe | select name category usage
    ```

    With your lazy frame defined we can start chaining operations on it. For
    example this

    ```nu
    $lf_0
    | polars reverse
    | polars with-column [
         ((polars col a) * 2 | polars as double_a)
         ((polars col a) / 2 | polars as half_a)
    ]
    | polars collect
    # => ╭───┬───┬───┬──────────┬────────╮
    # => │ # │ a │ b │ double_a │ half_a │
    # => ├───┼───┼───┼──────────┼────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ 4 │ d │        8 │      2 │
    # => │ 1 │ 3 │ c │        6 │      1 │
    # => │ 2 │ 2 │ b │        4 │      1 │
    # => │ 3 │ 1 │ a │        2 │      0 │
    # => ╰───┴───┴───┴──────────┴────────╯
    ```

    :::tip
    You can use the line buffer editor to format your queries (`ctr + o`) easily
    :::

    This query uses the lazy reverse command to invert the dataframe and the
    `polars with-column` command to create new two columns using `expressions`.
    An `expression` is used to define an operation that is executed on the lazy
    frame. When put together they create the whole set of instructions used by the
    lazy commands to query the data. To list all the commands that generate an
    expression you can use

    ```nu no-run
    scope commands | where category =~ expression | select name category usage
    ```

    In our previous example, we use the `polars col` command to indicate that column `a`
    will be multiplied by 2 and then it will be aliased to the name `double_a`.
    In some cases the use of the `polars col` command can be inferred. For example,
    using the `polars select` command we can use only a string

    ```nu
    $lf_0 | polars select a | polars collect
    # => ╭───┬───╮
    # => │ # │ a │
    # => ├───┼───┤
    # => │ 0 │ 1 │
    # => │ 1 │ 2 │
    # => │ 2 │ 3 │
    # => │ 3 │ 4 │
    # => ╰───┴───╯
    ```

    or the `polars col` command

    ```nu
    $lf_0 | polars select (polars col a) | polars collect
    # => ╭───┬───╮
    # => │ # │ a │
    # => ├───┼───┤
    # => │ 0 │ 1 │
    # => │ 1 │ 2 │
    # => │ 2 │ 3 │
    # => │ 3 │ 4 │
    # => ╰───┴───╯
    ```

    Let's try something more complicated and create aggregations from a lazy
    dataframe

    ```nu
    let lf_1 =  [[name value]; [one 1] [two 2] [one 1] [two 3]] | polars into-lazy

    $lf_1
    | polars group-by name
    | polars agg [
         (polars col value | polars sum | polars as sum)
         (polars col value | polars mean | polars as mean)
    ]
    | polars collect
    # => ╭───┬──────┬─────┬──────╮
    # => │ # │ name │ sum │ mean │
    # => ├───┼──────┼─────┼──────┤
    # => │ 0 │ two  │   5 │ 2.50 │
    # => │ 1 │ one  │   2 │ 1.00 │
    # => ╰───┴──────┴─────┴──────╯
    ```

    And we could join on a lazy dataframe that hasn't being collected. Let's join
    the resulting group by to the original lazy frame

    ```nu
    let lf_2 =  [[name value]; [one 1] [two 2] [one 1] [two 3]] | polars into-lazy
    let group = $lf_2
        | polars group-by name
        | polars agg [
          (polars col value | polars sum | polars as sum)
          (polars col value | polars mean | polars as mean)
        ]

    $lf_2 | polars join $group name name | polars collect
    # => ╭───┬──────┬───────┬─────┬──────╮
    # => │ # │ name │ value │ sum │ mean │
    # => ├───┼──────┼───────┼─────┼──────┤
    # => │ 0 │ one  │     1 │   2 │ 1.00 │
    # => │ 1 │ two  │     2 │   5 │ 2.50 │
    # => │ 2 │ one  │     1 │   2 │ 1.00 │
    # => │ 3 │ two  │     3 │   5 │ 2.50 │
    # => ╰───┴──────┴───────┴─────┴──────╯

    ## Future of Dataframes

    We hope that by the end of this page you have a solid grasp of how to use the
    dataframe commands. As you can see they offer powerful operations that can
    help you process data faster and natively.

    However, the future of these dataframes is still very experimental. New
    commands and tools that take advantage of these commands will be added as they
    mature.

    Check this chapter, as well as our [Blog](/blog/), regularly to learn about new
    dataframes features and how they can help you process data faster and efficiently.

    # Coming to Nu

    If you are familiar with other shells or programming languages, you might find this chapter useful to get up to speed.

    [Coming from Bash](coming_from_bash.md) shows how some patterns typical for Bash, or POSIX shells in general, can be mapped to Nushell.
    Similarly, [Coming from CMD.EXE](coming_from_cmd.md) shows how built-in commands in the Windows Command Prompt can be mapped to Nushell.

    Similar comparisons are made for some [other shells and domain-specific languages](nushell_map.md), [imperative languages](nushell_map_imperative.md), and [functional languages](nushell_map_functional.md).
    A separate comparison is made specifically for [operators](nushell_operator_map.md).

    Documentation text:

    # Coloring and Theming in Nu

    Many parts of Nushell's interface can have their color customized. All of these can be set in the `config.nu` configuration file. If you see the `#` outside of a text value in the config file it means the text after it is commented out.

    ## Table Borders

    Table borders are controlled by the `$env.config.table.mode` setting. It can be changed at run time, or in the `config.nu` file:

    ```nu
    $env.config.table.mode = 'rounded'
    ```

    The options for `$env.config.table.mode` can be listed with `table --list`:

    <!-- Generated with table --list | each {|| $"- `($in)`"} | sort | str join "\n"` -->

    - `ascii_rounded`
    - `basic_compact`
    - `basic`
    - `compact_double`
    - `compact`
    - `default`
    - `dots`
    - `heavy`
    - `light`
    - `markdown`
    - `none`
    - `psql`
    - `reinforced`
    - `restructured`
    - `rounded`
    - `thin`
    - `with_love`

    Examples:

    ```nu
    $env.config.table.mode = 'rounded'
    table --list | first 5
    # => ╭───┬────────────────╮
    # => │ 0 │ basic          │
    # => │ 1 │ compact        │
    # => │ 2 │ compact_double │
    # => │ 3 │ default        │
    # => │ 4 │ heavy          │
    # => ╰───┴────────────────╯

    $env.config.table.mode = 'psql'
    table --list | first 5
    # =>  0 | basic
    # =>  1 | compact
    # =>  2 | compact_double
    # =>  3 | default
    # =>  4 | heavy
    ```

    ## Color Configuration

    The color configuration is defined in `$env.config.color_config`. The current configuration can be printed with:

    ```nu
    $env.config.color_config | sort
    ```

    The color and style-attributes can be declared in multiple alternative formats.

    - `r` - normal color red's abbreviation
    - `rb` - normal color red's abbreviation with bold attribute
    - `red` - normal color red
    - `red_bold` - normal color red with bold attribute
    - `"#ff0000"` - "#hex" format foreground color red (quotes are required)
    - `{ fg: "#ff0000" bg: "#0000ff" attr: b }` - "full #hex" format foreground red in "#hex" format with a background of blue in "#hex" format with an attribute of bold abbreviated.
    - `{|x| 'yellow' }` - closure returning a string with one of the color representations listed above
    - `{|x| { fg: "#ff0000" bg: "#0000ff" attr: b } }` - closure returning a valid record

    ### `"#hex"` Format

    The "#hex" format is one way you typically see colors represented. It's simply the `#` character followed by 6 characters. The first two are for `red`, the second two are for `green`, and the third two are for `blue`. It's important that this string be surrounded in quotes, otherwise Nushell thinks it's a commented out string.

    Example: The primary `red` color is `"#ff0000"` or `"#FF0000"`. Upper and lower case in letters shouldn't make a difference.

    This `"#hex"` format allows us to specify 24-bit truecolor tones to different parts of Nushell.

    ### Full `"#hex"` Format

    The `full "#hex"` format is a take on the `"#hex"` format but allows one to specify the foreground, background, and attributes in one line.

    Example: `{ fg: "#ff0000" bg: "#0000ff" attr: b }`

    - foreground of red in "#hex" format
    - background of blue in "#hex" format
    - attribute of bold abbreviated

    ### Closure

    Note: Closures are only executed for table output. They do not work in other contexts like for `shape_` configurations, when printing a value directly, or as a value in a list.

    For example:

    ```nu
    $env.config.color_config.filesize = {|x| if $x == 0b { 'dark_gray' } else if $x < 1mb { 'cyan' } else { 'blue' } }
    $env.config.color_config.bool = {|x| if $x { 'green' } else { 'light_red' } }
    {a:true,b:false,c:0mb,d:0.5mb,e:10mib}
    ```

    prints

    ```nu
    ╭───┬───────────╮
    │ a │ true      │
    │ b │ false     │
    │ c │ 0 B       │
    │ d │ 488.3 KiB │
    │ e │ 10.0 MiB  │
    ╰───┴───────────╯
    ```

    with a green `true`, a light red `false`, a dark grey `0 B`, a cyan `488.3 KiB`, and a blue `10.0 MiB`.

    ## Primitive Values

    Primitive values are things like `int` and `string`. Primitive values and shapes can be set with a variety of color symbologies seen above.

    This is the current list of primitives. Not all of these are configurable. The configurable ones are marked with \*.

    | primitive    | default color         | configurable |
    | ------------ | --------------------- | ------------ |
    | `any`        |                       |              |
    | `binary`     | Color::White.normal() | \*           |
    | `block`      | Color::White.normal() | \*           |
    | `bool`       | Color::White.normal() | \*           |
    | `cellpath`   | Color::White.normal() | \*           |
    | `condition`  |                       |              |
    | `custom`     |                       |              |
    | `date`       | Color::White.normal() | \*           |
    | `duration`   | Color::White.normal() | \*           |
    | `expression` |                       |              |
    | `filesize`   | Color::White.normal() | \*           |
    | `float`      | Color::White.normal() | \*           |
    | `glob`       |                       |              |
    | `import`     |                       |              |
    | `int`        | Color::White.normal() | \*           |
    | `list`       | Color::White.normal() | \*           |
    | `nothing`    | Color::White.normal() | \*           |
    | `number`     |                       |              |
    | `operator`   |                       |              |
    | `path`       |                       |              |
    | `range`      | Color::White.normal() | \*           |
    | `record`     | Color::White.normal() | \*           |
    | `signature`  |                       |              |
    | `string`     | Color::White.normal() | \*           |
    | `table`      |                       |              |
    | `var`        |                       |              |
    | `vardecl`    |                       |              |
    | `variable`   |                       |              |

    ### Special "primitives" (not really primitives but they exist solely for coloring)

    | primitive                   | default color              | configurable |
    | --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------ |
    | `leading_trailing_space_bg` | Color::Rgb(128, 128, 128)) | \*           |
    | `header`                    | Color::Green.bold()        | \*           |
    | `empty`                     | Color::Blue.normal()       | \*           |
    | `row_index`                 | Color::Green.bold()        | \*           |
    | `hints`                     | Color::DarkGray.normal()   | \*           |

    Here's a small example of changing some of these values.

    ```nu
    let config = {
        color_config: {
            separator: purple
            leading_trailing_space_bg: "#ffffff"
            header: gb
            date: wd
            filesize: c
            row_index: cb
            bool: red
            int: green
            duration: blue_bold
            range: purple
            float: red
            string: white
            nothing: red
            binary: red
            cellpath: cyan
            hints: dark_gray
        }
    }
    ```

    Here's another small example using multiple color syntaxes with some comments.

    ```nu
    let config = {
        color_config: {
            separator: "#88b719" # this sets only the foreground color like PR #486
            leading_trailing_space_bg: white # this sets only the foreground color in the original style
            header: { # this is like PR #489
                fg: "#B01455", # note, quotes are required on the values with hex colors
                bg: "#ffb900", # note, commas are not required, it could also be all on one line
                attr: bli # note, there are no quotes around this value. it works with or without quotes
            }
            date: "#75507B"
            filesize: "#729fcf"
            row_index: {
                # note, that this is another way to set only the foreground, no need to specify bg and attr
                fg: "#e50914"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Shape Values

    As mentioned above, `shape` is a term used to indicate the syntax coloring.

    Here's the current list of flat shapes.

    - `PROMPT_COMMAND`: Code to execute for setting up the prompt (block)
    - `PROMPT_COMMAND_RIGHT`: Code to execute for setting up the _RIGHT_ prompt (block) (see oh-my.nu in nu_scripts)
    - `PROMPT_INDICATOR` = "〉": The indicator printed after the prompt (by default ">"-like Unicode symbol)
    - `PROMPT_INDICATOR_VI_INSERT` = ": "
    - `PROMPT_INDICATOR_VI_NORMAL` = "v "
    - `PROMPT_MULTILINE_INDICATOR` = "::: "
    - `render_right_prompt_on_last_line`: Bool value to enable or disable the right prompt to be rendered on the last line of the prompt

    Example: For a simple prompt one could do this. Note that `PROMPT_COMMAND` requires a `block` whereas the others require a `string`.

    ```nu
    $env.PROMPT_COMMAND = { $"(date now | format date '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S%.3f'): (pwd | path basename)" }
    ```

    If you don't like the default `PROMPT_INDICATOR` you could change it like this.

    ```nu
    $env.PROMPT_INDICATOR = "> "
    ```

    If you're using `starship`, you'll most likely want to show the right prompt on the last line of the prompt, just like zsh or fish. You could modify the `config.nu` file, just set `render_right_prompt_on_last_line` to true:

    ```nu
    config {
        render_right_prompt_on_last_line = true
        ...
    }
    ```

    Coloring of the prompt is controlled by the `block` in `PROMPT_COMMAND` where you can write your own custom prompt. We've written a slightly fancy one that has git statuses located in the [nu_scripts repo](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/modules/prompt/oh-my.nu).

    ### Transient Prompt

    If you want a different prompt displayed for previously entered commands, you can use Nushell's transient prompt feature. This can be useful if your prompt has lots of information that is unnecessary to show for previous lines (e.g. time and Git status), since you can make it so that previous lines show with a shorter prompt.

    Each of the `PROMPT_*` variables has a corresponding `TRANSIENT_PROMPT_*` variable to be used for changing that segment when displaying past prompts: `TRANSIENT_PROMPT_COMMAND`, `TRANSIENT_PROMPT_COMMAND_RIGHT`, `TRANSIENT_PROMPT_INDICATOR`, `TRANSIENT_PROMPT_INDICATOR_VI_INSERT`, `TRANSIENT_PROMPT_INDICATOR_VI_NORMAL`, `TRANSIENT_PROMPT_MULTILINE_INDICATOR`. By default, the `PROMPT_*` variables are used for displaying past prompts.

    For example, if you want to make past prompts show up without a left prompt entirely and leave only the indicator, you can use:

    ```nu
    $env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_COMMAND = ""
    ```

    If you want to go back to the normal left prompt, you'll have to unset `TRANSIENT_PROMPT_COMMAND`:

    ```nu
    hide-env TRANSIENT_PROMPT_COMMAND
    ```

    ## `LS_COLORS` Colors for the [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) Command

    Nushell will respect and use the `LS_COLORS` environment variable setting on Mac, Linux, and Windows. This setting allows you to define the coloring of file types when you do a [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md). For instance, you can make directories one color, `.md` Markdown files another color, `.toml` files yet another color, etc. There are a variety of ways to color and style your file types.

    If `LS_COLORS` is not set, nushell will default to a built-in `LS_COLORS` setting, based on [8-bit (extended) ANSI colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit).

    ### Understanding `LS_COLORS`

    `LS_COLORS` contains a colon (`:`) separated list of records that map file types and file names to styling attributes (`selector=attributes`).

    The selector can be a file type specified like `di` for "directory identifier", or `*.nu` for files with the `.nu` file extension.

    The attributes are a list of semicolon (`;`) separated numbers. Note that which attributes and attribute formats are supported depends on the terminal you are using.

    - Style attributes like `0` normal, `1` bold, `3` italic, `5` blink, [etc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Select_Graphic_Rendition_parameters)
    - [Foreground colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3-bit_and_4-bit) `30`-`37` and `90`-`97`
    - [Background colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3-bit_and_4-bit) `40`-`47` and `100`-`107`
    - [RGB foreground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#24-bit) prefixed with `38;2`, optionally followed by additional attributes
    - [RGB background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#24-bit) prefixed with `48;2`, optionally followed by additional attributes

    For example:

    `$env.LS_COLORS = "di=1;34:*.nu=3;33;46"`: Bold directories, italic yellow foreground cyan background `*.nu` files

    `$env.LS_COLORS = "di=48;2;200;0;0;5"`: Red background blinking directories

    ### vivid Themes

    For example, you can use the third-party tool [vivid](https://github.com/sharkdp/vivid), which runs on multiple platforms, has [many themes defined](https://github.com/sharkdp/vivid/tree/master/themes), and generates a `LS_COLORS` configuration from it.

    After downloading and extracting the binary, you can use it with:

    ```nu
    $env.LS_COLORS = (vivid generate molokai)
    ```

    or with an alternative theme:

    ```nu
    $env.LS_COLORS = (vivid generate ayu)
    ```

    You can put this command into your [Nushell configuration](/book/configuration.md) for it to become the default coloring.

    ## Theming

    Theming combines all the coloring above. Here's a quick example of one we put together quickly to demonstrate the ability to theme. This is a spin on the `base16` themes that we see so widespread on the web.

    The key to making theming work is to make sure you specify all themes and colors you're going to use in the `config.nu` file _before_ you declare the `let config = ` line.

    ```nu
    # let's define some colors

    let base00 = "#181818" # Default Background
    let base01 = "#282828" # Lighter Background (Used for status bars, line number and folding marks)
    let base02 = "#383838" # Selection Background
    let base03 = "#585858" # Comments, Invisibles, Line Highlighting
    let base04 = "#b8b8b8" # Dark Foreground (Used for status bars)
    let base05 = "#d8d8d8" # Default Foreground, Caret, Delimiters, Operators
    let base06 = "#e8e8e8" # Light Foreground (Not often used)
    let base07 = "#f8f8f8" # Light Background (Not often used)
    let base08 = "#ab4642" # Variables, XML Tags, Markup Link Text, Markup Lists, Diff Deleted
    let base09 = "#dc9656" # Integers, Boolean, Constants, XML Attributes, Markup Link Url
    let base0a = "#f7ca88" # Classes, Markup Bold, Search Text Background
    let base0b = "#a1b56c" # Strings, Inherited Class, Markup Code, Diff Inserted
    let base0c = "#86c1b9" # Support, Regular Expressions, Escape Characters, Markup Quotes
    let base0d = "#7cafc2" # Functions, Methods, Attribute IDs, Headings
    let base0e = "#ba8baf" # Keywords, Storage, Selector, Markup Italic, Diff Changed
    let base0f = "#a16946" # Deprecated, Opening/Closing Embedded Language Tags, e.g. <?php ?>

    # we're creating a theme here that uses the colors we defined above.

    let base16_theme = {
        separator: $base03
        leading_trailing_space_bg: $base04
        header: $base0b
        date: $base0e
        filesize: $base0d
        row_index: $base0c

        shape_variable: $base0e
        shape_flag: { fg: $base0d attr: b}
        shape_custom: {attr: b}
    }

    # now let's apply our regular config settings but also apply the "color_config:" theme that we specified above.

    let config = {
      filesize_metric: true
      table_mode: rounded # basic, compact, compact_double, light, thin, with_love, rounded, reinforced, heavy, none, other
      use_ls_colors: true
      color_config: $base16_theme # <-- this is the theme
      use_grid_icons: true
      footer_mode: always #always, never, number_of_rows, auto
      animate_prompt: false
      float_precision: 2
      use_ansi_coloring: true
      filesize_format: "b" # b, kb, kib, mb, mib, gb, gib, tb, tib, pb, pib, eb, eib, auto
      edit_mode: emacs # vi
      max_history_size: 10000
      log_level: error
    }
    ```

    if you want to go full-tilt on theming, you'll want to theme all the items I mentioned at the very beginning, including LS_COLORS, and the prompt. Good luck!

    ### Working on Light Background Terminal

    Nushell's [standard library](/book/standard_library.md) contains a `config` module with default light and dark themes.
    If you are working on a light background terminal, you can apply the light theme easily.

    ```nu
    # in $nu.config-path
    use config light-theme   # add this line to load the theme into scope

    $env.config = {
      # ...
      color_config: (light_theme)   # if you want a light theme, replace `$dark_theme` to `$light_theme`
      # ...
    }
    ```

    You can also load the dark theme.

    ```nu
    # in $nu.config-path
    use config dark-theme

    $env.config = {
      # ...
      color_config: (dark_theme)
      # ...
    }
    ```

    ## Accessibility

    It's often desired to have the minimum amount of decorations when using a screen reader. In those cases, it's possible to disable borders and other decorations for both table and errors with the following options:

    ```nu
    # in $nu.config-path
    $env.config = {
      ...
      table: {
       ...
        mode: "none"

      }
      error_style: "plain"
      ...
    }
    ```

    ## Line Editor Menus (completion, history, help…)

    Reedline (Nu’s line editor) style is not using the `color_config` key.
    Instead, each menu has its own style to be configured separately.
    See the [section dedicated to Reedline’s menus configuration](line_editor.md#menus) to learn more on this.

    # Modules

    Like many programming languages, Nushell supports writing and using _modules_ as a way to organize code more efficiently. Modules can be thought of a "containers" that hold various definitions, including:

    - Additional custom commands
    - Aliases
    - Constants
    - Externs
    - Environment variables
    - And even other modules (a.k.a., submodules)

    Many users will start off using modules written by others, then progress to writing their own. This chapter covers those two topics:

    - [Using Modules](./modules/using_modules.md)
    - [Creating Modules](./modules/creating_modules.md)

    Documentation text:

    # Scripts

    In Nushell, you can write and run scripts in the Nushell language. To run a script, you can pass it as an argument to the `nu` commandline application:

    ```nu
    nu myscript.nu
    ```

    This will run the script to completion in a new instance of Nu. You can also run scripts inside the _current_ instance of Nu using [`source`](/commands/docs/source.md):

    ```nu
    source myscript.nu
    ```

    Let's look at an example script file:

    ```nu
    # myscript.nu
    def greet [name] {
      ["hello" $name]
    }

    greet "world"
    ```

    A script file defines the definitions for custom commands as well as the main script itself, which will run after the custom commands are defined.

    In the above example, first `greet` is defined by the Nushell interpreter. This allows us to later call this definition. We could have written the above as:

    ```nu
    greet "world"

    def greet [name] {
      ["hello" $name]
    }
    ```

    There is no requirement that definitions have to come before the parts of the script that call the definitions, allowing you to put them where you feel comfortable.

    ## How Scripts are Processed

    In a script, definitions run first. This allows us to call the definitions using the calls in the script.

    After the definitions run, we start at the top of the script file and run each group of commands one after another.

    ## Script Lines

    To better understand how Nushell sees lines of code, let's take a look at an example script:

    ```nu
    a
    b; c | d
    ```

    When this script is run, Nushell will first run the `a` command to completion and view its results. Next, Nushell will run `b; c | d` following the rules in the ["Semicolons" section](pipelines.html#semicolons).

    ## Parameterizing Scripts

    Script files can optionally contain a special "main" command. `main` will be run after any other Nu code, and is primarily used to allow positional parameters and flags in scripts. You can pass arguments to scripts after the script name (`nu <script name> <script args>`).

    For example:

    ```nu
    # myscript.nu

    def main [x: int] {
      $x + 10
    }
    ```

    ```nu
    nu myscript.nu 100
    # => 110
    ```

    ## Argument Type Interpretation

    By default, arguments provided to a script are interpreted with the type `Type::Any`, implying that they are not constrained to a specific data type and can be dynamically interpreted as fitting any of the available data types during script execution.

    In the previous example, `main [x: int]` denotes that the argument x should possess an integer data type. However, if arguments are not explicitly typed, they will be parsed according to their apparent data type.

    For example:

    ```nu
    # implicit_type.nu
    def main [x] {
      $"Hello ($x | describe) ($x)"
    }

    # explicit_type.nu
    def main [x: string] {
      $"Hello ($x | describe) ($x)"
    }
    ```

    ```nu
    nu implicit_type.nu +1
    # => Hello int 1

    nu explicit_type.nu +1
    # => Hello string +1
    ```

    ## Subcommands

    A script can have multiple [subcommands](custom_commands.html#subcommands), like `run` or `build` for example:

    ```nu
    # myscript.nu
    def "main run" [] {
        print "running"
    }

    def "main build" [] {
        print "building"
    }

    def main [] {
        print "hello from myscript!"
    }
    ```

    You can then execute the script's subcommands when calling it:

    ```nu
    nu myscript.nu
    # => hello from myscript!
    nu myscript.nu build
    # => building
    nu myscript.nu run
    # => running
    ```

    [Unlike modules](modules.html#main), `main` does _not_ need to be exported in order to be visible. In the above example, our `main` command is not `export def`, however it was still executed when running `nu myscript.nu`. If we had used myscript as a module by running `use myscript.nu`, rather than running `myscript.nu` as a script, trying to execute the `myscript` command would not work since `myscript` is not exported.

    It is important to note that you must define a `main` command in order for subcommands of `main` to be correctly exposed. For example, if we had just defined the `run` and `build` subcommands, they wouldn't be accessible when running the script:

    ```nu
    # myscript.nu
    def "main run" [] {
        print "running"
    }

    def "main build" [] {
        print "building"
    }
    ```

    ```nu
    nu myscript.nu build
    nu myscript.nu run
    ```

    This is a limitation of the way scripts are currently processed. If your script only has subcommands, you can add an empty `main` to expose the subcommands, like so:

    ```nu
    def main [] {}
    ```

    ## Shebangs (`#!`)

    On Linux and macOS you can optionally use a [shebang](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>) to tell the OS that a file should be interpreted by Nu. For example, with the following in a file named `myscript`:

    ```nu
    #!/usr/bin/env nu
    "Hello World!"
    ```

    ```nu
    ./myscript
    # => Hello World!
    ```

    For script to have access to standard input, `nu` should be invoked with `--stdin` flag:

    ```nu
    #!/usr/bin/env -S nu --stdin
    def main [] {
      echo $"stdin: ($in)"
    }
    ```

    ```nu
    echo "Hello World!" | ./myscript
    # => stdin: Hello World!
    ```

    # Best Practices

    This page is a working document collecting syntax guidelines and best practices we have discovered so far.
    The goal of this document is to eventually land on a canonical Nushell code style, but as for now it is still work in
    progress and subject to change. We welcome discussion and contributions.

    Keep in mind that these guidelines are not required to be used in external repositories (not ours), you can change them in the
    way you want, but please be consistent and follow your rules.

    All escape sequences should not be interpreted literally, unless directed to do so. In other words,
    treat something like `\n` like the new line character and not a literal slash followed by `n`.

    ## Formatting

    ### Defaults

    **It's recommended to** assume that by default no spaces or tabs allowed, but the following rules define where they are allowed.

    ### Basic

    - **It's recommended to** put one space before and after pipe `|` symbol, commands, subcommands, their options and arguments.
    - **It's recommended to** never put several consecutive spaces unless they are part of string.
    - **It's recommended to** omit commas between list items.

    Correct:

    ```nu
    'Hello, Nushell! This is a gradient.' | ansi gradient --fgstart '0x40c9ff' --fgend '0xe81cff'
    ```

    Incorrect:

    ```nu
    # - too many spaces after "|": 2 instead of 1
    'Hello, Nushell! This is a gradient.' |  ansi gradient --fgstart '0x40c9ff' --fgend '0xe81cff'
    ```

    #### One-line Format

    One-line format is a format for writing all commands in one line.

    **It's recommended to** default to this format:

    1. unless you are writing scripts
    2. in scripts for lists and records unless they either:
       1. more than 80 characters long
       2. contain nested lists or records
    3. for pipelines less than 80 characters long not containing items should be formatted with
       a long format

    Rules:

    1. parameters:
       1. **It's recommended to** put one space after comma `,` after block or closure parameter.
       2. **It's recommended to** put one space after pipe `|` symbol denoting block or closure parameter list end.
    2. block and closure bodies:
       1. **It's recommended to** put one space after opening block or closure curly brace `{` if no explicit parameters defined.
       2. **It's recommended to** put one space before closing block or closure curly brace `}`.
    3. records:
       1. **It's recommended to** put one space after `:` after record key.
       2. **It's recommended to** put one space after comma `,` after key value.
    4. lists:
       1. **It's recommended to** put one space after comma `,` after list value.
    5. surrounding constructs:
       1. **It's recommended to** put one space before opening square `[`, curly brace `{`, or parenthesis `(` if preceding symbol is not the same.
       2. **It's recommended to** put one space after closing square `]`, curly brace `}`, or parenthesis `)` if following symbol is not the same.

    Correct:

    ```nu
    [[status]; [UP] [UP]] | all {|el| $el.status == UP }
    [1 2 3 4] | reduce {|elt, acc| $elt + $acc }
    [1 2 3 4] | reduce {|elt acc| $elt + $acc }
    {x: 1, y: 2}
    {x: 1 y: 2}
    [1 2] | zip [3 4]
    []
    (1 + 2) * 3
    ```

    Incorrect:

    ```nu
    # too many spaces before "|el|": no space is allowed
    [[status]; [UP] [UP]] | all { |el| $el.status == UP }

    # too many spaces before ",": no space is allowed
    [1 2 3 4] | reduce {|elt , acc| $elt + $acc }

    # too many spaces before "x": no space is allowed
    { x: 1, y: 2}

    # too many spaces before "[3": one space is required
    [1 2] | zip  [3 4]

    # too many spaces before "]": no space is allowed
    [ ]

    # too many spaces before ")": no space is allowed
    (1 + 2 ) * 3
    ```

    #### Multi-line Format

    Multi-line format is a format for writing all commands in several lines. It inherits all rules from one-line format
    and modifies them slightly.

    **It's recommended to** default to this format:

    1. while you are writing scripts
    2. in scripts for lists and records while they either:
       1. more than 80 characters long
       2. contain nested lists or records
    3. for pipelines more 80 characters long

    Rules:

    1. general:
       1. **It's required to omit** trailing spaces.
    2. block and closure bodies:
       1. **It's recommended to** put each body pipeline on a separate line.
    3. records:
       1. **It's recommended to** put each record key-value pair on separate line.
    4. lists:
       1. **It's recommended to** put each list item on separate line.
    5. surrounding constructs:
       1. **It's recommended to** put one `\n` before opening square `[`, curly brace `{`, or parenthesis `(` if preceding symbol is not the and applying this rule produce line with a singular parenthesis.
       2. **It's recommended to** put one `\n` after closing square `]`, curly brace `}`, or parenthesis `)` if following symbol is not the same and applying this rule produce line with a singular parenthesis.

    Correct:

    ```nu
    [[status]; [UP] [UP]] | all {|el|
        $el.status == UP
    }

    [1 2 3 4] | reduce {|elt, acc|
        $elt + $acc
    }

    {x: 1, y: 2}

    [
      {name: "Teresa", age: 24},
      {name: "Thomas", age: 26}
    ]

    let selectedProfile = (for it in ($credentials | transpose name credentials) {
        echo $it.name
    })
    ```

    Incorrect:

    ```nu
    # too many spaces before "|el|": no space is allowed (like in one-line format)
    [[status]; [UP] [UP]] | all { |el|
        # too few "\n" before "}": one "\n" is required
        $el.status == UP}

    # too many spaces before "2": one space is required (like in one-line format)
    [1  2 3 4] | reduce {|elt, acc|
        $elt + $acc
    }

    {
       # too many "\n" before "x": one-line format required as no nested lists or record exist
       x: 1,
       y: 2
    }

    # too few "\n" before "{": multi-line format required as there are two nested records
    [{name: "Teresa", age: 24},
      {name: "Thomas", age: 26}]

    let selectedProfile = (
        # too many "\n" before "foo": no "\n" is allowed
        for it in ($credentials | transpose name credentials) {
            echo $it.name
    })
    ```

    ## Naming Convention

    ### Abbreviations and Acronyms

    **It's recommended** to use full concise words over abbreviations and acronyms, unless they are well-known and/or
    commonly used.

    Correct:

    ```nu
    query-user --id 123

    $user.name | str downcase
    ```

    Incorrect:

    ```nu
    qry-usr --id 123

    $user.name | string downcase
    ```

    ### Case

    #### Commands

    **It's recommended to** use kebab-case for command names with multiple words.

    Correct:

    ```nu
    fetch-user --id 123
    ```

    Incorrect:

    ```nu
    fetch_user --id 123
    fetchUser --id 123
    ```

    See also [Naming Commands](custom_commands.md#naming-commands).

    #### Sub-Commands

    Sub commands are commands that are logically grouped under a parent command and separated by a space.
    **It's recommended to** use kebab-case for the sub-command name.

    Correct:

    ```nu
    date now

    date list-timezone

    def "login basic-auth" [username: string password: string] {
        # ...
    }
    ```

    See also [Naming Sub-Commands](custom_commands.md#subcommands).

    #### Flags

    **It's recommended to** use kebab-case for flag names.

    Correct:

    ```nu
    def greet [name: string, --all-caps] {
        # ...
    }
    ```

    Incorrect:

    ```nu
    def greet [name: string, --all_caps] {
        # ...
    }
    ```

    ::: tip
    Notice that the name used to access the flag is accessed by replacing the dash with an underscore in the resulting
    variable name.

    See [Flags](custom_commands.md#flags).
    :::

    #### Variables and Command Parameters

    **It's recommended to** use snake_case for variable names, including command parameters.

    Correct:

    ```nu
    let user_id = 123

    def fetch-user [user_id: int] {
      # ...
    }
    ```

    Incorrect:

    ```nu
    let user-id = 123
    let userId = 123

    def fetch-user [user-id: int] {
      # ...
    }
    ```

    #### Environment Variables

    **It's recommended to** use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for environment variable names.

    Correct:

    ```nu
    $env.ENVIRONMENT_CODE = "prod"

    $env.APP_VERSION = "1.0.0"
    ```

    Incorrect:

    ```nu
    $env.ENVIRONMENT-CODE = "prod"

    $env.app_version = "1.0.0"
    ```

    ## Options and Parameters of Custom Commands

    - **It's recommended to** keep count of all positional parameters less than or equal to 2, for remaining inputs use options. Assume that command can expect source and destination parameter, like `mv`: source and target file or directory.
    - **It's recommended to** use positional parameters unless they can't be used due to rules listed here or technical restrictions.
      For instance, when there are several kinds of optional parameters (but at least one parameter should be provided)
      use options. Great example of this is `ansi gradient` command where at least foreground or background must be passed.
    - **It's recommended to** provide both long and short options.

    ## Documentation

    - **It's recommended to** provide documentation for all exported entities (like custom commands) and their
      inputs (like custom command parameters and options).

    # Testing your Nushell Code

    ## Assert Commands

    Nushell provides a set of "assertion" commands in the standard library.
    One could use built-in equality / order tests such as `==` or `<=` or more complex commands and throw errors manually when an expected condition fails, but using what the standard library has to offer is arguably easier!

    In the following, it will be assumed that the `std assert` module has been imported inside the current scope

    ```nu
    use std/assert
    ```

    The foundation for every assertion is the `std assert` command. If the condition is not true, it makes an error.

    ```nu
    assert (1 == 2)
    ```

    ```
    Error:
      × Assertion failed.
       ╭─[entry #13:1:1]
     1 │ assert (1 == 2)
       ·         ───┬──
       ·            ╰── It is not true.
       ╰────
    ```

    Optionally, a message can be set to show the intention of the assert command, what went wrong or what was expected:

    ```nu
    let a = 0
    assert ($a == 19) $"The lockout code is wrong, received: ($a)"
    ```

    ```
    Error:
      × The lockout code is wrong, received: 13
       ╭─[entry #25:1:1]
     1 │ let a = 0
     2 │ assert ($a == 19) $"The lockout code is wrong, received: ($a)"
       ·         ────┬───
       ·             ╰── It is not true.
       ╰────
    ```

    There are many assert commands, which behave exactly as the base one with the proper operator. The additional value for them is the ability for better error messages.

    For example this is not so helpful without additional message:

    ```nu
    let a = "foo"
    let b = "bar"
    assert ($b | str contains $a)
    ```

    ```
    Error:   × Assertion failed.
       ╭─[entry #5:3:8]
     2 │ let b = "bar"
     3 │ assert ($b | str contains $a)
       ·        ───────────┬──────────
       ·                   ╰── It is not true.
       ╰────
    ```

    While with using `assert str contains`:

    ```nu
    let a = "a needle"
    let b = "haystack"
    assert str contains $b $a
    ```

    ```
    Error:   × Assertion failed.
       ╭─[entry #7:3:21]
     2 │ let b = "bar"
     3 │ assert str contains $b $a
       ·                     ──┬──
       ·                       ╰─┤ This does not contain 'a needle'.
       ·                         │         value: "haystack"
       ╰────
    ```

    In general for base `assert` command it is encouraged to always provide the additional message to show what went wrong. If you cannot use any built-in assert command, you can create a custom one with passing the label for [`error make`](/commands/docs/error_make.md) for the `assert` command:

    ```nu
    def "assert even" [number: int] {
        assert ($number mod 2 == 0) --error-label {
            text: $"($number) is not an even number",
            span: (metadata $number).span,
        }
    }
    ```

    Then you'll have your detailed custom error message:

    ```nu
    let $a = 13
    assert even $a
    ```

    ```
    Error:
      × Assertion failed.
       ╭─[entry #37:1:1]
     1 │ assert even $a
       ·             ─┬
       ·              ╰── 13 is not an even number
       ╰────
    ```

    ## Running the Tests

    Now that we are able to write tests by calling commands from `std assert`, it would be great to be able to run them and see our tests fail when there is an issue and pass when everything is correct :)

    ### Nupm Package

    In this first case, we will assume that the code you are trying to test is part of a [Nupm] package.

    In that case, it is as easy as following the following steps

    - create a `tests/` directory next to the `nupm.nuon` package file of your package
    - make the `tests/` directory a valid module by adding a `mod.nu` file into it
    - write commands inside `tests/`
    - call `nupm test`

    The convention is that any command fully exported from the `tests` module will be run as a test, e.g.

    - `export def some-test` in `tests/mod.nu` will run
    - `def just-an-internal-cmd` in `tests/mod.nu` will NOT run
    - `export def another-test` in `tests/spam.nu` will run if and only if there is something like `export use spam.nu *` in `tests/mod.nu`

    ### Standalone Tests

    If your Nushell script or module is not part of a [Nupm] package, the simplest way is to write tests in standalone scripts and then call them, either from a `Makefile` or in a CI:

    Let's say we have a simple `math.nu` module which contains a simple Fibonacci command:

    ```nu
    # `fib n` is the n-th Fibonacci number
    export def fib [n: int] [ nothing -> int ] {
        if $n == 0 {
            return 0
        } else if $n == 1 {
            return 1
        }

        (fib ($n - 1)) + (fib ($n - 2))
    }
    ```

    then a test script called `tests.nu` could look like

    ```nu
    use math.nu fib
    use std/assert

    for t in [
        [input, expected];
        [0, 0],
        [1, 1],
        [2, 1],
        [3, 2],
        [4, 3],
        [5, 5],
        [6, 8],
        [7, 13],
    ] {
        assert equal (fib $t.input) $t.expected
    }
    ```

    and be invoked as `nu tests.nu`

    ### Basic Test Framework

    It is also possible to define tests in Nushell as functions with descriptive names and discover
    them dynamically without requiring a [Nupm] package. The following uses `scope commands` and a
    second instance of Nushell to run the generated list of tests.

    ```nu
    use std/assert

    source fib.nu

    def main [] {
        print "Running tests..."

        let test_commands = (
            scope commands
                | where ($it.type == "custom")
                    and ($it.name | str starts-with "test ")
                    and not ($it.description | str starts-with "ignore")
                | get name
                | each { |test| [$"print 'Running test: ($test)'", $test] } | flatten
                | str join "; "
        )

        nu --commands $"source ($env.CURRENT_FILE); ($test_commands)"
        print "Tests completed successfully"
    }

    def "test fib" [] {
        for t in [
            [input, expected];
            [0, 0],
            [1, 1],
            [2, 1],
            [3, 2],
            [4, 3],
            [5, 5],
            [6, 8],
            [7, 13]
        ] {
            assert equal (fib $t.input) $t.expected
        }
    }

    # ignore
    def "test show-ignored-test" [] {
        print "This test will not be executed"
    }
    ```

    This is a simple example but could be extended to include many of the things you might expect from
    a testing framework, including setup and tear down functions and test discovery across files.

    Documentation text:

    # Background Jobs

    Nushell currently has experimental support for thread-based background jobs.

    ## Spawning Jobs

    Jobs can be can be spawned using [`job spawn`](/commands/docs/job_spawn.md), which receives a closure and starts its execution in a background thread, returning
    an unique integer id for the spawned job:

    ```nu
    'i am' | save status.txt

    job spawn { sleep 10sec; ' inevitable' | save --append status.txt }
    # => 1

    open status.txt
    # => i am

    # wait for 10 seconds
    sleep 10sec

    open status.txt
    # => i am inevitable
    ```

    ## Listing and Killing jobs

    Active jobs can be queried with the [`job list`](/commands/docs/job_list.md) command, which returns a table with the information of the jobs which are currently executing.
    Jobs can also be killed/interrupted by using the [`job kill`](/commands/docs/job_kill.md) command, which interrupts the job's thread and kills all of the job's child processes:

    ```nu
    let id = job spawn { sleep 1day }

    job list
    # => ┏━━━┳━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
    # => ┃ # ┃ id ┃  type  ┃      pids      ┃
    # => ┣━━━╋━━━━╋━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┫
    # => ┃ 0 ┃  1 ┃ thread ┃ [list 0 items] ┃
    # => ┗━━━┻━━━━┻━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

    job kill $id

    job list
    # => ╭────────────╮
    # => │ empty list │
    # => ╰────────────╯
    ```

    ## Job suspension

    On Unix targets, such as Linux and macOS, Nushell also supports suspending external commands using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>. When a running process is suspended, it is turned into a "frozen" background job:

    ```nu
    long_running_process # this starts running, then Ctrl+Z is pressed
    # => Job 1 is frozen

    job list
    # => ┏━━━┳━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
    # => ┃ # ┃ id ┃  type  ┃      pids      ┃
    # => ┣━━━╋━━━━╋━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┫
    # => ┃ 0 ┃  1 ┃ frozen ┃ [list 1 items] ┃
    # => ┗━━━┻━━━━┻━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
    ```

    A frozen job can be brought back into foreground with the [`job unfreeze`](/commands/docs/job_unfreeze.md) command:

    ```nu
    job unfreeze
    # process is brought back where it stopped
    ```

    ::: tip Tip
    For those familiar with other Unix shells, you can create an alias to emulate the behavior of the `fg` command:

    ```nu
    alias fg = job unfreeze
    ```

    :::

    By default, `job unfreeze` will unfreeze the most recently frozen job. However, you can also specify the id of a specific job to unfreeze:

    ```nu
    vim
    # => Job 1 is frozen

    long_running_process
    # => Job 2 is frozen

    job unfreeze 1
    # we're back in vim
    ```

    ## Exit Behavior

    Unlike many other shells, Nushell jobs are **not** separate processes,
    and are instead implemented as background threads.

    An important side effect of this, is that all background jobs will terminate once the shell
    process exits.
    For this reason, Nushell has no UNIX-like `disown` command to prevent jobs from terminating once the shell exits.
    To account for that, there are plans for a `job dispatch` implementation in the future,
    for spawning independent background processes.

    Additionally, if the user is running an interactive Nushell session and runs
    [`exit`](/commands/docs/exit.md) while there are background jobs running,
    the shell will warn about them before prompting the user to confirm `exit`.

Here is some text copied from the `operators page of the documentation provided by Nushell`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# Operators\n\nNushell supports the following operators for common math, logic, and string operations:\n\n| Operator           | Description                                             |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `+`                | add                                                     |\n| `-`                | subtract                                                |\n| `*`                | multiply                                                |\n| `/`                | divide                                                  |\n| `//`               | floor division                                          |\n| `mod`              | modulo                                                  |\n| `**`               | exponentiation (power)                                  |\n| `==`               | equal                                                   |\n| `!=`               | not equal                                               |\n| `<`                | less than                                               |\n| `<=`               | less than or equal                                      |\n| `>`                | greater than                                            |\n| `>=`               | greater than or equal                                   |\n| `=~` or `like`     | regex match / string contains another                   |\n| `!~` or `not-like` | inverse regex match / string does *not* contain another |\n| `in`               | value in list                                           |\n| `not-in`           | value not in list                                       |\n| `has`              | list has value                                          |\n| `not-has`          | list does not have value                                |\n| `not`              | logical not                                             |\n| `and`              | and two Boolean expressions (short-circuits)            |\n| `or`               | or two Boolean expressions (short-circuits)             |\n| `xor`              | exclusive or two boolean expressions                    |\n| `bit-or`           | bitwise or                                              |\n| `bit-xor`          | bitwise xor                                             |\n| `bit-and`          | bitwise and                                             |\n| `bit-shl`          | bitwise shift left                                      |\n| `bit-shr`          | bitwise shift right                                     |\n| `starts-with`      | string starts with                                      |\n| `ends-with`        | string ends with                                        |\n| `++`               | append lists                                            |\n\n\nParentheses can be used for grouping to specify evaluation order or for calling commands and using the results in an expression.\n\n## Order of Operations\n\nTo understand the precedence of operations, you can run the command: `help operators | sort-by precedence -r`.\n\nPresented in descending order of precedence, the article details the operations as follows:\n\n- Parentheses (`()`)\n- Exponentiation/Power (`**`)\n- Multiply (`*`), Divide (`/`), Integer/Floor Division (`//`), and Modulo (`mod`)\n- Add (`+`) and Subtract (`-`)\n- Bit shifting (`bit-shl`, `bit-shr`)\n- Comparison operations (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), membership tests (`in`, `not-in`, `starts-with`, `ends-with`), regex matching (`=~`, `!~`), and list appending (`++`)\n- Bitwise and (`bit-and`)\n- Bitwise xor (`bit-xor`)\n- Bitwise or (`bit-or`)\n- Logical and (`and`)\n- Logical xor (`xor`)\n- Logical or (`or`)\n- Assignment operations\n- Logical not (`not`)\n\n```nu\n3 * (1 + 2)\n# => 9\n```\n\n## Types\n\nNot all operations make sense for all data types.\nIf you attempt to perform an operation on non-compatible data types, you will be met with an error message that should explain what went wrong:\n```nu\n\"spam\" - 1\n# => Error: nu::parser::unsupported_operation (link)\n# => \n# =>   × Types mismatched for operation.\n# =>    ╭─[entry #49:1:1]\n# =>  1 │ \"spam\" - 1\n# =>    · ───┬── ┬ ┬\n# =>    ·    │   │ ╰── int\n# =>    ·    │   ╰── doesn't support these values.\n# =>    ·    ╰── string\n# =>    ╰────\n# =>   help: Change string or int to be the right types and try again.\n```\n\nThe rules might sometimes feel a bit strict, but on the other hand there should be less unexpected side effects.\n\n## Regular Expression / string-contains Operators\n\nThe `=~` and `!~` operators provide a convenient way to evaluate [regular expressions](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/). You don't need to know regular expressions to use them - they're also an easy way to check whether 1 string contains another.\n\n- `string =~ pattern` returns **true** if `string` contains a match for `pattern`, and **false** otherwise.\n- `string !~ pattern` returns **false** if `string` contains a match for `pattern`, and **true** otherwise.\n\nFor example:\n\n```nu\nfoobarbaz =~ bar # returns true\nfoobarbaz !~ bar # returns false\nls | where name =~ ^nu # returns all files whose names start with \"nu\"\n```\n\nBoth operators use [the Rust regex crate's `is_match()` function](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/struct.Regex.html#method.is_match).\n\n## Case Sensitivity\n\nOperators are usually case-sensitive when operating on strings. There are a few ways to do case-insensitive work instead:\n\n1. In the regular expression operators, specify the `(?i)` case-insensitive mode modifier:\n\n```nu\n\"FOO\" =~ \"foo\" # returns false\n\"FOO\" =~ \"(?i)foo\" # returns true\n```\n\n2. Use the [`str contains`](/commands/docs/str_contains.md) command's `--ignore-case` flag:\n\n```nu\n\"FOO\" | str contains --ignore-case \"foo\"\n```\n\n3. Convert strings to lowercase with [`str downcase`](/commands/docs/str_downcase.md) before comparing:\n\n```nu\n(\"FOO\" | str downcase) == (\"Foo\" | str downcase)\n```\n\n## Spread operator\n\nNushell has a spread operator (`...`) for unpacking lists and records. You may be familiar with it\nif you've used JavaScript before. Some languages use `*` for their spread/splat operator. It can\nexpand lists or records in places where multiple values or key-value pairs are expected.\n\nThere are three places you can use the spread operator:\n\n- [In list literals](#in-list-literals)\n- [In record literals](#in-record-literals)\n- [In command calls](#in-command-calls)\n\n### In List literals\n\nSuppose you have multiple lists you want to concatenate together, but you also want to intersperse\nsome individual values. This can be done with `append` and `prepend`, but the spread\noperator can let you do it more easily.\n\n```nu\nlet dogs = [Spot, Teddy, Tommy]\nlet cats = [\"Mr. Humphrey Montgomery\", Kitten]\n[\n  ...$dogs\n  Polly\n  ...($cats | each { |elt| $\"($elt) \\(cat\\)\" })\n  ...[Porky Bessie]\n  ...Nemo\n]\n# => ╭───┬───────────────────────────────╮\n# => │ 0 │ Spot                          │\n# => │ 1 │ Teddy                         │\n# => │ 2 │ Tommy                         │\n# => │ 3 │ Polly                         │\n# => │ 4 │ Mr. Humphrey Montgomery (cat) │\n# => │ 5 │ Kitten (cat)                  │\n# => │ 6 │ Porky                         │\n# => │ 7 │ Bessie                        │\n# => │ 8 │ ...Nemo                       │\n# => ╰───┴───────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\nThe below code is an equivalent version using `append`:\n```nu\n$dogs |\n  append Polly |\n  append ($cats | each { |elt| $\"($elt) \\(cat\\)\" }) |\n  append [Porky Bessie] |\n  append ...Nemo\n```\n\nNote that each call to `append` results in the creation of a new list, meaning that in this second\nexample, 3 unnecessary intermediate lists are created. This is not the case with the spread operator,\nso there may be (very minor) performance benefits to using `...` if you're joining lots of large\nlists together, over and over.\n\nYou may have noticed that the last item of the resulting list above is `\"...Nemo\"`. This is because\ninside list literals, it can only be used to spread lists, not strings. As such, inside list literals, it can\nonly be used before variables (`...$foo`), subexpressions (`...(foo)`), and list literals (`...[foo]`).\n\nThe `...` also won't be recognized as the spread operator if there's any whitespace between it and\nthe next expression:\n\n```nu\n[ ... [] ]\n# => ╭───┬────────────────╮\n# => │ 0 │ ...            │\n# => │ 1 │ [list 0 items] │\n# => ╰───┴────────────────╯\n```\n\nThis is mainly so that `...` won't be confused for the spread operator in commands such as `mv ... $dir`.\n\n### In Record literals\n\nLet's say you have a record with some configuration information and you want to add more fields to\nthis record:\n\n```nu\nlet config = { path: /tmp, limit: 5 }\n```\n\nYou can make a new record with all the fields of `$config` and some new additions using the spread\noperator. You can use the spread multiple records inside a single record literal.\n\n```nu\n{\n  ...$config,\n  users: [alice bob],\n  ...{ url: example.com },\n  ...(sys mem)\n}\n# => ╭────────────┬───────────────╮\n# => │ path       │ /tmp          │\n# => │ limit      │ 5             │\n# => │            │ ╭───┬───────╮ │\n# => │ users      │ │ 0 │ alice │ │\n# => │            │ │ 1 │ bob   │ │\n# => │            │ ╰───┴───────╯ │\n# => │ url        │ example.com   │\n# => │ total      │ 8.3 GB        │\n# => │ free       │ 2.6 GB        │\n# => │ used       │ 5.7 GB        │\n# => │ available  │ 2.6 GB        │\n# => │ swap total │ 2.1 GB        │\n# => │ swap free  │ 18.0 MB       │\n# => │ swap used  │ 2.1 GB        │\n# => ╰────────────┴───────────────╯\n```\n\nSimilarly to lists, inside record literals, the spread operator can only be used before variables (`...$foo`),\nsubexpressions (`...(foo)`), and record literals (`...{foo:bar}`). Here too, there needs to be no\nwhitespace between the `...` and the next expression for it to be recognized as the spread operator.\n\n### In Command calls\n\nYou can also spread arguments to a command, provided that it either has a rest parameter or is an\nexternal command.\n\nHere is an example custom command that has a rest parameter:\n\n```nu\ndef foo [ --flag req opt? ...args ] { [$flag, $req, $opt, $args] | to nuon }\n```\n\nIt has one flag (`--flag`), one required positional parameter (`req`), one optional positional parameter\n(`opt?`), and rest parameter (`args`).\n\nIf you have a list of arguments to pass to `args`, you can spread it the same way you'd spread a list\n[inside a list literal](#in-list-literals). The same rules apply: the spread operator is only\nrecognized before variables, subexpressions, and list literals, and no whitespace is allowed in between.\n\n```nu\nfoo \"bar\" \"baz\" ...[1 2 3] # With ..., the numbers are treated as separate arguments\n# => [false, bar, baz, [1, 2, 3]]\nfoo \"bar\" \"baz\" [1 2 3] # Without ..., [1 2 3] is treated as a single argument\n# => [false, bar, baz, [[1, 2, 3]]]\n```\n\nA more useful way to use the spread operator is if you have another command with a rest parameter\nand you want it to forward its arguments to `foo`:\n\n```nu\ndef bar [ ...args ] { foo --flag \"bar\" \"baz\" ...$args }\nbar 1 2 3\n# => [true, bar, baz, [1, 2, 3]]\n```\n\nYou can spread multiple lists in a single call, and also intersperse individual arguments:\n\n```nu\nfoo \"bar\" \"baz\" 1 ...[2 3] 4 5 ...(6..9 | take 2) last\n# => [false, bar, baz, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, last]]\n```\n\nFlags/named arguments can go after a spread argument, just like they can go after regular rest arguments:\n\n```nu\nfoo \"bar\" \"baz\" 1 ...[2 3] --flag 4\n# => [true, bar, baz, [1, 2, 3, 4]]\n```\n\nIf a spread argument comes before an optional positional parameter, that optional parameter is treated\nas being omitted:\n\n```nu\nfoo \"bar\" ...[1 2] \"not opt\" # The null means no argument was given for opt\n# => [false, bar, null, [1, 2, \"not opt\"]]\n```"

    # Moving Around the System

    A defining characteristic of a shell is the ability to navigate and interact with the filesystem. Nushell is, of course, no exception. Here are some common commands you might use when interacting with the filesystem:

    ## Viewing Directory Contents

    ```nu
    ls
    ```

    As seen in the Quick Tour, the [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) command returns the contents of a directory. Nushell's `ls` will return the contents as a [table](types_of_data.html#tables).

    The [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) command also takes an optional argument to change what you'd like to view. For example, we can list the files that end in ".md"

    ```nu
    ls *.md
    # => ╭───┬────────────────────┬──────┬──────────┬──────────────╮
    # => │ # │        name        │ type │   size   │   modified   │
    # => ├───┼────────────────────┼──────┼──────────┼──────────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md │ file │  3.4 KiB │ 9 months ago │
    # => │ 1 │ CONTRIBUTING.md    │ file │ 11.0 KiB │ 5 months ago │
    # => │ 2 │ README.md          │ file │ 12.0 KiB │ 6 days ago   │
    # => │ 3 │ SECURITY.md        │ file │  2.6 KiB │ 2 months ago │
    # => ╰───┴────────────────────┴──────┴──────────┴──────────────╯
    ```

    ## Glob Patterns (wildcards)

    The asterisk (`*`) in the above optional argument `*.md` is sometimes called a wildcard or a glob. It lets us match anything. You can read this glob `*.md` as _"match any filename, so long as it ends with '.md'."_

    The most general glob is `*`, which will match all paths. More often, you'll see this pattern used as part of another pattern, for example `*.bak` and `temp*`.

    Nushell also supports a double `*` which will traverse paths that are nested inside of other directories. For example, `ls **/*` will list all the non-hidden paths nested under the current directory.

    ```nu
    ls **/*.md
    # => ╭───┬───────────────────────────────┬──────┬──────────┬──────────────╮
    # => │ # │             name              │ type │   size   │   modified   │
    # => ├───┼───────────────────────────────┼──────┼──────────┼──────────────┤

    # => ╰───┴───────────────────────────────┴──────┴──────────┴──────────────╯
    ```

    Here, we're looking for any file that ends with ".md". The double-asterisks further specify _"in any directory starting from here."_

    Nushell's globbing syntax not only supports `*`, but also matching [single characters with `?` and character groups with `[...]`](https://docs.rs/nu-glob/latest/nu_glob/struct.Pattern.html).

    Escaping the `*`, `?`, and `[]` patterns works by enclosing them in a single-quoted, double-quoted, or
    [raw string](working_with_strings.md#raw-strings). For example, to show the contents of a directory named
    `[slug]`, use `ls "[slug]"` or `ls '[slug]'`.

    However, _backtick_ quoted strings do not escape globs. For example, compare the following scenarios:

    1. Unquoted: Glob pattern

       An unquoted [bare word string](working_with_strings.html#bare-word-strings) with glob characters is interpreted as a glob pattern, so the following will remove all files in the current directory that contain
       `myfile` as any part of the filename:

       ```nu
       rm *myfile*
       ```

    2. Quoted: String literal with asterisks

       When quoting with single or double quotes, or using a [raw string](working_with_strings.html#raw-strings), a _string_ with the literal, escaped asterisks (or other glob characters) is passed to the command. The result is not a glob. The following command will only remove a file literally named `*myfile*` (including the asterisks). Other files with `myfile` in the name are not affected:

       ```nu
       rm "*myfile*"
       ```

    3. Backtick-quoted: Glob pattern

       Asterisks (and other glob patterns) within a [backtick-quoted string](working_with_strings.html#backtick-quoted-strings) are interpreted as a glob pattern. Notice that this is the same behavior as that of the bare-word string example in #1 above.

       The following, as with that first example, removes all files in the current directory that contain `myfile` as part of the filename

       ```nu
       rm `*myfile*`
       ```

    ::: tip
    Nushell also includes a dedicated [`glob` command](https://www.nushell.sh/commands/docs/glob.html) with support for more complex globbing scenarios.
    :::

    ### Converting Strings to Globs

    The quoting techniques above are useful when constructing glob-literals, but you may need to construct globs programmatically. There are several techniques available for this purpose:

    1. `into glob`

       The [`into glob` command](/commands/docs/into_glob.html) can be used to convert a string (and other types) into a glob. For instance:

       ```nu
       # Find files whose name includes the current month in the form YYYY-mm
       let current_month = (date now | format date '%Y-%m')
       let glob_pattern = ($"*($current_month)*" | into glob)
       ls $glob_pattern
       ```

    2. The spread operator combined with the [`glob` command](/commands/docs/glob.html):

       The [`glob` command](/commands/docs/glob.html) (note: not the same as `into glob`) produces a [`list`](types_of_data.html#lists) of filenames that match the glob pattern. This list can be expanded and passed to filesystem commands using the [spread operator](operators.html#spread-operator):

       ```nu
       # Find files whose name includes the current month in the form YYYY-mm
       let current_month = (date now | format date '%Y-%m')
       ls ...(glob $"*($current_month)*")
       ```

    3. Force `glob` type via annotation:

       ```nu
       # Find files whose name includes the current month in the form YYYY-mm
       let current_month = (date now | format date '%Y-%m')
       let glob_pattern: glob = ($"*($current_month)*")
       ls $glob_pattern
       ```

    ## Creating a Directory

    As with most other shells, the [`mkdir` command](/commands/docs/mkdir.md) is used to create new directories. One subtle difference is that Nushell's internal `mkdir` command operates like the Unix/Linux `mkdir -p` by default, in that it:

    - Will create multiple directory levels automatically. For example:

      ```nu
      mkdir modules/my/new_module
      ```

      This will create all three directories even if none of them currently exists. On Linux/Unix, this requires `mkdir -p`.

    - Will not error if the directory already exists. For example:

      ```nu
      mkdir modules/my/new_module
      mkdir modules/my/new_module
      # => No error
      ```

      ::: tip
      A common mistake when coming to Nushell is to attempt to use `mkdir -p <directory>` as in the native Linux/Unix version. However, this will generate an `Unknown Flag` error on Nushell.

      Just repeat the command without the `-p` to achieve the same effect.
      :::

    ## Changing the Current Directory

    ```nu
    cd cookbook
    ```

    To change from the current directory to a new one, use the [`cd`](/commands/docs/cd.md) command.

    Changing the current working directory can also be done if [`cd`](/commands/docs/cd.md) is omitted and a path by itself is given:

    ```nu
    cookbook/
    ```

    Just as in other shells, you can use either the name of the directory, or if you want to go up a directory you can use the `..` shortcut.

    You can also add additional dots to go up additional directory levels:

    ```nu
    # Change to the parent directory
    cd ..
    # or
    ..
    # Go up two levels (parent's parent)
    cd ...
    # or
    ...
    # Go up three levels (parent of parent's parent)
    cd ....
    # Etc.
    ```

    ::: tip
    Multi-dot shortcuts are available to both internal Nushell [filesystem commands](/commands/categories/filesystem.html) as well as to external commands. For example, running `^stat ....` on a Linux/Unix system will show that the path is expanded to `../../..`
    :::

    You can combine relative directory levels with directory names as well:

    ```nu
    cd ../sibling
    ```

    ::: tip IMPORTANT TIP
    Changing the directory with [`cd`](/commands/docs/cd.md) changes the `PWD` environment variable. This means that a change of a directory is kept to the current scope (e.g. block or closure). Once you exit the block, you'll return to the previous directory. You can learn more about this in the [Environment](./environment.md) chapter.
    :::

    ## Filesystem Commands

    Nu also provides some basic [filesystem commands](/commands/categories/filesystem.html) that work cross-platform such as:

    - [`mv`](/commands/docs/mv.md) to rename or move a file or directory to a new location
    - [`cp`](/commands/docs/cp.md) to copy an item to a new location
    - [`rm`](/commands/docs/rm.md) to remove items from the filesystem

    ::: tip NOTE
    Under Bash and many other shells, most filesystem commands (other than `cd`) are actually separate binaries in the system. For instance, on a Linux system, `cp` is the `/usr/bin/cp` binary. In Nushell, these commands are built-in. This has several advantages:

    - They work consistently on platforms where a binary version may not be available (e.g. Windows). This allows the creation of cross-platform scripts, modules, and custom commands.
    - They are more tightly integrated with Nushell, allowing them to understand Nushell types and other constructs
    - As mentioned in the [Quick Tour](quick_tour.html), they are documented in the Nushell help system. Running `help <command>` or `<command> --help` will display the Nushell documentation for the command.

    While the use of the Nushell built-in versions is typically recommended, it is possible to access the Linux binaries. See [Running System Commands](./running_externals.md) for details.

    # Navigating and Accessing Structured Data

    Given Nushell's strong support for structured data, some of the more common tasks involve navigating and accessing that data.

    ## Index to this Section

    - [Cell-paths](#cell-paths)
      - [With Records](#records)
      - [With Lists](#lists)
      - [With Tables](#tables)

        - Example - Access a Table Row
        - Example - Access a Table Column
      - [With Nested Data](#nested-data)
    - [Using `get` and `select`](#using-get-and-select)
      - Example - `get` vs. `select` with a Table Row
      - Example - `select` with multiple rows and columns
    - [Handling missing data using the optional operator](#the-optional-operator)
    - [Key/Column names with spaces](#keycolumn-names-with-spaces)
    - [Other commands for navigating structured data](#other-commands-for-accessing-structured-data)

    ## Background

    For the examples and descriptions below, keep in mind several definitions regarding structured data:

    - **_List:_** Lists contain a series of zero or more values of any type. A list with zero values is known as an "empty list"
    - **_Record:_** Records contain zero or more pairs of named keys and their corresponding value. The data in a record's value can also be of any type. A record with zero key-value pairs is known as an "empty record"
    - **_Nested Data:_** The values contained in a list, record, or table can be either of a basic type or structured data themselves. This means that data can be nested multiple levels and in multiple forms:
      - List values can contain tables, records, and even other lists
        - **_Table:_** Tables are a list of records
      - Record values can contain tables, lists, and other records
        - This means that the records of a table can also contain nested tables, lists, and other records

    ::: tip
    Because a table is a list of records, any command or syntax that works on a list will also work on a table. The converse is not necessarily the case; there are some commands and syntax that work on tables but not lists.
    :::

    ## Cell-paths

    A cell-path is the primary way to access values inside structured data. This path is based on a concept similar to that of a spreadsheet, where columns have names and rows have numbers. Cell-path names and indices are separated by dots.

    ### Records

    For a record, the cell-path specifies the name of a key, which is a `string`.

    #### Example - Access a Record Value:

    ```nu
    let my_record = {
        a: 5
        b: 42
      }
    $my_record.b + 5
    # => 47
    ```

    ### Lists

    For a list, the cell-path specifies the position (index) of the value in the list. This is an `int`:

    #### Example - Access a List Value:

    Remember, list indices are 0-based.

    ```nu
    let scoobies_list = [ Velma Fred Daphne Shaggy Scooby ]
    $scoobies_list.2
    # => Daphne
    ```

    ### Tables

    - To access a column, a cell-path uses the name of the column, which is a `string`
    - To access a row, it uses the index number of the row, which is an `int`
    - To access a single cell, it uses a combination of the column name with the row index.

    The next few examples will use the following table:

    ```nu
    let data = [
        [date                        temps                                   condition      ];
        [2022-02-01T14:30:00+05:00,  [38.24, 38.50, 37.99, 37.98, 39.10],   'sunny'       ],
        [2022-02-02T14:30:00+05:00,  [35.24, 35.94, 34.91, 35.24, 36.65],   'sunny'       ],
        [2022-02-03T14:30:00+05:00,  [35.17, 36.67, 34.42, 35.76, 36.52],   'cloudy'      ],
        [2022-02-04T14:30:00+05:00,  [39.24, 40.94, 39.21, 38.99, 38.80],   'rain'        ]
    ]
    ```

    :::

    This represents weather data in the form of a table with three columns:

    1. **_date_**: A Nushell `date` for each day
    2. **_temps_**: A Nushell `list` of 5 `float` values representing temperature readings at different weather stations in the area
    3. **_conditions_**: A Nushell `string` for each day's weather condition for the area

    #### Example - Access a Table Row (Record)

    Access the second day's data as a record:

    ```nu
    $data.1
    # => ╭───────────┬───────────────╮
    # => │ date      │ 2 years ago   │
    # => │           │ ╭───┬───────╮ │
    # => │ temps     │ │ 0 │ 35.24 │ │
    # => │           │ │ 1 │ 35.94 │ │
    # => │           │ │ 2 │ 34.91 │ │
    # => │           │ │ 3 │ 35.24 │ │
    # => │           │ │ 4 │ 36.65 │ │
    # => │           │ ╰───┴───────╯ │
    # => │ condition │ sunny         │
    # => ╰───────────┴───────────────╯
    ```

    #### Example - Access a Table Column (List)

    ```nu
    $data.condition
    # => ╭───┬────────╮
    # => │ 0 │ sunny  │
    # => │ 1 │ sunny  │
    # => │ 2 │ cloudy │
    # => │ 3 │ rain   │
    # => ╰───┴────────╯
    ```

    #### Example - Access a Table Cell (Value)

    The condition for the fourth day:

    ```nu
    $data.condition.3
    # => rain
    ```

    ### Nested Data

    Since data can be nested, a cell-path can contain references to multiple names or indices.

    #### Example - Accessing Nested Table Data

    To obtain the temperature at the second weather station on the third day:

    ```nu
    $data.temps.2.1
    # => 36.67
    ```

    The first index `2` accesses the third day, then the next index `1` accesses the second weather station's temperature reading.

    ## Using `get` and `select`

    In addition to the cell-path literal syntax used above, Nushell also provides several commands that utilize cell-paths. The most important of these are:

    - `get` is equivalent to using a cell-path literal but with support for variable names and expressions. `get`, like the cell-path examples above, returns the **value** indicated by the cell-path.
    - `select` is subtly, but critically, different. It returns the specified **data structure** itself, rather than just its value.
      - Using `select` on a table will return a table of equal or lesser size
      - Using `select` on a list will return a list of equal or lesser size
      - using `select` on a record will return a record of equal or lesser size

    Continuing with the sample table above:

    ### Example - `get` vs. `select` a table row

    ```nu
    $data | get 1
    # => ╭───────────┬───────────────╮
    # => │ date      │ 2 years ago   │
    # => │           │ ╭───┬───────╮ │
    # => │ temps     │ │ 0 │ 35.24 │ │
    # => │           │ │ 1 │ 35.94 │ │
    # => │           │ │ 2 │ 34.91 │ │
    # => │           │ │ 3 │ 35.24 │ │
    # => │           │ │ 4 │ 36.65 │ │
    # => │           │ ╰───┴───────╯ │
    # => │ condition │ sunny         │
    # => ╰───────────┴───────────────╯

    $data | select 1
    # => ╭───┬─────────────┬───────────────┬───────────╮
    # => │ # │    date     │     temps     │ condition │
    # => ├───┼─────────────┼───────────────┼───────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ 2 years ago │ ╭───┬───────╮ │ sunny     │
    # => │   │             │ │ 0 │ 35.24 │ │           │
    # => │   │             │ │ 1 │ 35.94 │ │           │
    # => │   │             │ │ 2 │ 34.91 │ │           │
    # => │   │             │ │ 3 │ 35.24 │ │           │
    # => │   │             │ │ 4 │ 36.65 │ │           │
    # => │   │             │ ╰───┴───────╯ │           │
    # => ╰───┴─────────────┴───────────────┴───────────╯
    ```

    Notice that:

    - [`get`](/commands/docs/get.md) returns the same record as the `$data.1` example above
    - [`select`](/commands/docs/select.md) returns a new, single-row table, including column names and row indices

    ::: tip
    The row indices of the table resulting from `select` are not the same as that of the original. The new table has its own, 0-based index.

    To obtain the original index, you can use the [`enumerate`](/commands/docs/enumerate.md) command. For example:

    ```nu
    $data | enumerate | select 1
    ```

    :::

    ### Example - `select` with multiple rows and columns

    Because `select` results in a new table, it's possible to specify multiple column names, row indices, or even both. This example creates a new table containing the date and condition columns of the first and second rows:

    ```nu
    $data | select date condition 0 1
    # => ╭───┬─────────────┬───────────╮
    # => │ # │    date     │ condition │
    # => ├───┼─────────────┼───────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ 2 years ago │ sunny     │
    # => │ 1 │ 2 years ago │ sunny     │
    # => ╰───┴─────────────┴───────────╯
    ```

    ## Key/Column names with spaces

    If a key name or column name contains spaces or other characters that prevent it from being accessible as a bare-word string, then the key name may be quoted.

    Example:

    ```nu
    let record_example = {
        "key x":12
        "key y":4
      }
    $record_example."key x"
    # => 12

    # or
    $record_example | get "key x"
    # => 12
    ```

    Quotes are also required when a key name may be confused for a numeric value.

    Example:

    ```nu
    let record_example = {
      "1": foo
      "2": baz
      "3": far
    }

    $record_example."1"
    # =>   foo
    ```

    Do not confuse the key name with a row index in this case. Here, the first item is _assigned_ the key name `1` (a string). If converted to a table using the `transpose` command, key `1` (`string`) would be at row-index `0` (an integer).

    ## Handling Missing Data

    ### The Optional Operator

    By default, cell path access will fail if it can't access the requested row or column. To suppress these errors, you can add a `?` to a cell path member to mark it as optional:

    #### Example - The Optional Operator

    Using the temp data from above:

    ```nu
    let cp: cell-path = $.temps?.1 # only get the 2nd location from the temps column

    # Ooops, we've removed the temps column
    $data | reject temps | get $cp
    ```

    By default missing cells will be replaced by `null` when accessed via the optional operator.

    ### Assigning a `default` for missing or `null` data

    The [`default` command](/commands/docs/default.html) can be used to apply a default value to missing or null column result.

    ```nu
    let missing_value = [{a:1 b:2} {b:1}]
    $missing_value
    # => ╭───┬────┬───╮
    # => │ # │ a  │ b │
    # => ├───┼────┼───┤
    # => │ 0 │  1 │ 2 │
    # => │ 1 │ ❎ │ 1 │
    # => ╰───┴────┴───╯

    let with_default_value = ($missing_value | default 'n/a' a)
    $with_default_value
    # => ╭───┬─────┬───╮
    # => │ # │  a  │ b │
    # => ├───┼─────┼───┤
    # => │ 0 │   1 │ 2 │
    # => │ 1 │ n/a │ 1 │
    # => ╰───┴─────┴───╯

    $with_default_value.1.a
    # => n/a
    ```

    ## Other commands for accessing structured data

    - [`reject`](/commands/docs/reject.md) is the opposite of `select`, removing the specified rows and columns

    # Introduction

    Hello, and welcome to the Nushell project.
    The goal of this project is to take the Unix philosophy of shells, where pipes connect simple commands together, and bring it to the modern style of development.
    Thus, rather than being either a shell, or a programming language, Nushell connects both by bringing a rich programming language and a full-featured shell together into one package.

    Nu takes cues from a lot of familiar territory: traditional shells like bash, object based shells like PowerShell, gradually typed languages like TypeScript, functional programming, systems programming, and more. But rather than trying to be a jack of all trades, Nu focuses its energy on doing a few things well:

    - Being a flexible cross-platform shell with a modern feel
    - Solving problems as a modern programming language that works with the structure of your data
    - Giving clear error messages and clean IDE support

    ## This Book

    The book is split into chapters which are further broken down into sections.
    You can click on the chapter headers to get more information about it.

    - [Installation](installation.md), of course, helps you get Nushell onto your system.
    - [Getting Started](getting_started.md) shows you the ropes. It also explains some of the design principles where Nushell differs from typical shells, such as Bash.
    - [Nu Fundamentals](nu_fundamentals.md) explains basic concepts of the Nushell language.
    - [Programming in Nu](programming_in_nu.md) dives more deeply into the language features and shows several ways how to organize and structure your code.
    - [Nu as a Shell](nu_as_a_shell.md) focuses on the shell features, most notably the configuration and environment.
    - [Coming to Nu](coming_to_nu.md) is intended to give a quick start for users coming from other shells or languages.
    - [Design Notes](design_notes.md) has in-depth explanation of some of the Nushell's design choices.
    - [(Not So) Advanced](advanced.md) includes some more advanced topics (they are not _so_ advanced, make sure to check them out, too!).

    ## The Many Parts of Nushell

    The Nushell project consists of multiple different repositories and subprojects.
    You can find all of them under [our organization on GitHub](https://github.com/nushell).

    - The main Nushell repository can be found [here](https://github.com/nushell/nushell). It is broken into multiple crates that can be used as independent libraries in your own project, if you wish so.
    - The repository of our [nushell.sh](https://www.nushell.sh) page, including this book, can be found [here](https://github.com/nushell/nushell.github.io).
    - Nushell has its own line editor which [has its own repository](https://github.com/nushell/reedline)
    - [`nu_scripts`](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts) is a place to share scripts and modules with other users until we have some sort of package manager.
    - [Nana](https://github.com/nushell/nana) is an experimental effort to explore graphical user interface for Nushell.
    - [Awesome Nu](https://github.com/nushell/awesome-nu) contains a list of tools that work with the Nushell ecosystem: plugins, scripts, editor extension, 3rd party integrations, etc.
    - [Nu Showcase](https://github.com/nushell/showcase) is a place to share works about Nushell, be it blogs, artwork or something else.
    - [Request for Comment (RFC)](https://github.com/nushell/rfcs) serves as a place to propose and discuss major design changes. While currently under-utilized, we expect to use it more as we get closer to and beyond 1.0.

    Documentation text:

    # Metadata

    In using Nu, you may have come across times where you felt like there was something extra going on behind the scenes. For example, let's say that you try to open a file that Nu supports only to forget and try to convert again:

    ```nu
    open Cargo.toml | from toml
    # => error: Expected a string from pipeline
    # => - shell:1:18
    # => 1 | open Cargo.toml | from toml
    # =>   |                   ^^^^^^^^^ requires string input
    # => - shell:1:5
    # => 1 | open Cargo.toml | from toml
    # =>   |      ---------- object originates from here
    ```

    The error message tells us not only that what we gave [`from toml`](/commands/docs/from_toml.md) wasn't a string, but also where the value originally came from. How would it know that?

    Values that flow through a pipeline in Nu often have a set of additional information, or metadata, attached to them. These are known as tags, like the tags on an item in a store. These tags don't affect the data, but they give Nu a way to improve the experience of working with that data.

    Let's run the [`open`](/commands/docs/open.md) command again, but this time, we'll look at the tags it gives back:

    ```nu
    metadata (open Cargo.toml)
    # => ╭──────┬───────────────────╮
    # => │ span │ {record 2 fields} │
    # => ╰──────┴───────────────────╯
    ```

    Currently, we track only the span of where values come from. Let's take a closer look at that:

    ```nu
    metadata (open Cargo.toml) | get span
    # => ╭───────┬────────╮
    # => │ start │ 212970 │
    # => │ end   │ 212987 │
    # => ╰───────┴────────╯
    ```

    The span "start" and "end" here refer to where the underline will be in the line. If you count over 5, and then count up to 15, you'll see it lines up with the "Cargo.toml" filename. This is how the error we saw earlier knew what to underline.

  documentationQuestion2: How can a user inspect the span information of a file opened in Nu using the metadata command?
  documentationQuestion3: What are the common use cases for leveraging span information in Nu's metadata system when debugging or error handling?

    # Nushell operator map

    The idea behind this table is to help you understand how Nu operators relate to other language operators. We've tried to produce a map of all the nushell operators and what their equivalents are in other languages. Contributions are welcome.

    Note: this table assumes Nu 0.14.1 or later.

    # Reedline, Nu's Line Editor

    Nushell's line-editor [Reedline](https://github.com/nushell/reedline) is
    cross-platform and designed to be modular and flexible. The line-editor is
    in charge of controlling the command history, validations, completions, hints,
    screen paint, and more.

    [[toc]]

    ## Multi-line Editing

    Reedline allows Nushell commandlines to extend across multiple lines. This can be accomplished using several methods:

    1. Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> when a bracketed expression is open.

       For example:

       ```nu
       def my-command [] {
       ```

       Pressing <kbd>Enter </kbd> after the open-bracket will insert a newline. This will also occur with opening (and valid) `(` and `[` expressions.

       This is commonly used to create blocks and closures (as above), but also list, record, and table literals:

       ```nu
       let file = {
         name: 'repos.sqlite'
         hash: 'b939a3fa4ca011ca1aa3548420e78cee'
         version: '1.4.2'
       }
       ```

       It can even be used to continue a single command across multiple lines:

       ::: details Example

       ```nu
       (
         tar
         -cvz
         -f archive.tgz
         --exclude='*.temp'
         --directory=../project/
         ./
       )
       ```

       :::

    2. Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> at the end of a line with a trailing pipe-symbol (`|`).

       ```nu
       ls                     |
       where name =~ '^[0-9]' | # Comments after a trailing pipe are okay
       get name               |
       mv ...$in ./backups/
       ```

    3. Manually insert a newline using <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.

       This can be used to create a somewhat more readable version of the previous commandline:

       ```nu
       ls
       | where name =~ '^[0-9]'  # Files starting with a digit
       | get name
       | mv ...$in ./backups/
       ```

       ::: tip
       It's possible that one or both of these keybindings may be intercepted by the terminal application or window-manager. For instance, Windows Terminal (and most other terminal applications on Windows) assign <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to expand the terminal to full-screen. If neither of the above keybindings work in your terminal, you can assign a different keybinding to:

       ```nu
       event: { edit: insertnewline }
       ```

       See [Keybindings](#keybindings) below for more details.

       :::

    4. Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> opens the current commandline in your editor. Saving the resulting file and exiting the editor will update the commandline with the results.

    Documentation text:

    ## Setting the Editing Mode

    Reedline allows you to edit text using two modes — Vi and Emacs. If not
    specified, the default mode is Emacs. To change the mode, use the
    `edit_mode` setting.

    ```nu
    $env.config.edit_mode = 'vi'
    ```

    This can be changed at the commandline or persisted in `config.nu`.

    ::: note
    Vi is a "modal" editor with "normal" mode and an "insert" mode. We recommend
    becoming familiar with these modes through the use of the Vim or Neovim editors
    before using Vi mode in Nushell. Each has a built-in tutorial covering the basics
    (and more) of modal editing.
    :::

    ## Default Keybindings

    Each edit mode comes with common keybindings for Vi and Emacs text editing.

    ### Emacs and Vi-insert Keybindings

    These keybinding events apply to both Emacs and Vi-insert mode:

    | <kbd>Ctrl></kbd>+<kbd>←</kbd> (Left Arrow)  | Move left one word  |

    ### Vi-normal Motions

    As with Vi, many motions and actions can be combined with an optional count in normal-mode. For example, <kbd>3</kbd><kbd>d</kbd><kbd>w</kbd> deletes the next three words.

    | Key                                    | Motion                                        |
    | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
    | <kbd>w</kbd>                           | Move to beginning of next word                |
    | <kbd>e</kbd>                           | Move to end of current or next word           |
    | <kbd>b</kbd>                           | Move to beginning of current or previous word |
    | <kbd>0</kbd>                           | Move to start of line                         |
    | <kbd>$</kbd>                           | Move to end of line                           |
    | <kbd>h</kbd>                           | Move left                                     |
    | <kbd>l</kbd>                           | Move right                                    |
    | <kbd>j</kbd>                           | Move down                                     |
    | <kbd>k</kbd>                           | Move up                                       |
    | <kbd>f</kbd>+\<char\>                  | Move right to \<char\>                        |
    | <kbd>t</kbd>+\<char\>                  | Move right to before \<char\>                 |
    | <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>+\<char\> | Move left to \<char\>                         |
    | <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>+\<char\> | Move left to after \<char\>                   |

    ### Vi-normal Actions

    These actions can be combined with many of the [motions above](#vi-normal-motions).

    | Key                           | Action                                             |

    | <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> | Delete to end of line                              |
    | <kbd>p</kbd>                  | Paste after current character                      |
    | <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> | Paste before current character                     |
    | <kbd>i</kbd>                  | Enter Vi insert-mode (append) at current character |
    | <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> | Enter insert-mode at beginning of line             |
    | <kbd>a</kbd>                  | Append after current character                     |

    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `line_editor page of the documentation provided by Nushell`.



    Documentation text:

    ## Command History

    As mentioned before, Reedline manages and stores all the commands that are
    edited and sent to Nushell. To configure the max number of records that
    Reedline should store you will need to adjust this value in your config file:

    ```nu
      $env.config = {
        ...
        history: {
          ...
          max_size: 1000
          ...
        }
        ...
      }
    ```

    ## Customizing the Prompt

    The Reedline prompt is configured using a number of environment variables. See [Prompt Configuration](./configuration.md#prompt-configuration) for details.

    ## Keybindings

    Reedline keybindings are powerful constructs that let you build chains of
    events that can be triggered with a specific combination of keys.

    For example, let's say that you would like to map the completion menu to the
    `Ctrl + t` keybinding (default is `tab`). You can add the next entry to your
    config file.

    ```nu
      $env.config = {
        ...

        keybindings: [
          {
            name: completion_menu
            modifier: control
            keycode: char_t
            mode: emacs
            event: { send: menu name: completion_menu }
          }
        ]

        ...
      }
    ```

    After loading this new `config.nu`, your new keybinding (`Ctrl + t`) will open
    the completion command.

    Each keybinding requires the next elements:

    - name: Unique name for your keybinding for easy reference in `$config.keybindings`
    - modifier: A key modifier for the keybinding. The options are:
      - none
      - control
      - alt
      - shift
      - shift_alt
      - alt_shift
      - control_alt
      - alt_control
      - control_shift
      - shift_control
      - control_alt_shift
      - control_shift_alt
    - keycode: This represent the key to be pressed
    - mode: emacs, vi_insert, vi_normal (a single string or a list. e.g.
      [`vi_insert` `vi_normal`])
    - event: The type of event that is going to be sent by the keybinding. The
      options are:
      - send
      - edit
      - until

    ::: tip
    All of the available modifiers, keycodes and events can be found with
    the command [`keybindings list`](/commands/docs/keybindings_list.md)
    :::

    ::: tip
    The keybindings added to `vi_insert` mode will be available when the
    line editor is in insert mode (when you can write text), and the keybindings
    marked with `vi_normal` mode will be available when in normal (when the cursor
    moves using h, j, k or l)
    :::

    The event section of the keybinding entry is where the actions to be performed
    are defined. In this field you can use either a record or a list of records.
    Something like this

    ```nu
      ...
      event: { send: Enter }
      ...
    ```

    or

    ```nu
      ...
      event: [
        { edit: Clear }
        { send: Enter }
      ]
      ...
    ```

    The first keybinding example shown in this page follows the first case; a
    single event is sent to the engine.

    The next keybinding is an example of a series of events sent to the engine. It
    first clears the prompt, inserts a string and then enters that value

    ```nu
      $env.config = {
        ...

        keybindings: [
        {
          name: change_dir_with_fzf
          modifier: CONTROL
          keycode: Char_t
          mode: emacs
          event:[
              { edit: Clear }
              { edit: InsertString,
                value: "cd (ls | where type == dir | each { |row| $row.name} | str join (char nl) | fzf | decode utf-8 | str trim)"

              }
              { send: Enter }
            ]
        }

        ...
      }
    ```

    One disadvantage of the previous keybinding is the fact that the inserted text
    will be processed by the validator and saved in the history, making the
    keybinding a bit slow and populating the command history with the same command.
    For that reason there is the `executehostcommand` type of event. The next
    example does the same as the previous one in a simpler way, sending a single
    event to the engine

    ```nu
      $env.config = {
        ...

        keybindings: [
        {
          name: change_dir_with_fzf
          modifier: CONTROL
          keycode: Char_y
          mode: emacs
          event: {
            send: executehostcommand,
            cmd: "cd (ls | where type == dir | each { |row| $row.name} | str join (char nl) | fzf | decode utf-8 | str trim)"
          }
        }
      ]

        ...
      }
    ```

    Before we continue you must have noticed that the syntax changes for edits and
    sends, and for that reason it is important to explain them a bit more. A `send`
    is all the `Reedline` events that can be processed by the engine and an `edit`
    are all the `EditCommands` that can be processed by the engine.

    ### Send Type

    To find all the available options for `send` you can use

    ```nu
    keybindings list | where type == events
    ```

    And the syntax for `send` events is the next one

    ```nu
        ...
          event: { send: <NAME OF EVENT FROM LIST> }
        ...
    ```

    ::: tip
    You can write the name of the events with capital letters. The
    keybinding parser is case insensitive
    :::

    There are two exceptions to this rule: the `Menu` and `ExecuteHostCommand`.
    Those two events require an extra field to be complete. The `Menu` needs the
    name of the menu to be activated (completion_menu or history_menu)

    ```nu
        ...
          event: {
            send: menu
            name: completion_menu
          }
        ...
    ```

    and the `ExecuteHostCommand` requires a valid command that will be sent to the
    engine

    ```nu
        ...
          event: {
            send: executehostcommand
            cmd: "cd ~"
          }
        ...
    ```

    It is worth mentioning that in the events list you will also see `Edit([])`,
    `Multiple([])` and `UntilFound([])`. These options are not available for the
    parser since they are constructed based on the keybinding definition. For
    example, a `Multiple([])` event is built for you when defining a list of
    records in the keybinding's event. An `Edit([])` event is the same as the
    `edit` type that was mentioned. And the `UntilFound([])` event is the same as
    the `until` type mentioned before.

    ### Edit Type

    The `edit` type is the simplification of the `Edit([])` event. The `event` type
    simplifies defining complex editing events for the keybindings. To list the
    available options you can use the next command

    ```nu
    keybindings list | where type == edits
    ```

    The usual syntax for an `edit` is the next one

    ```nu
        ...
          event: { edit: <NAME OF EDIT FROM LIST> }
        ...
    ```

    The syntax for the edits in the list that have a `()` changes a little bit.
    Since those edits require an extra value to be fully defined. For example, if
    we would like to insert a string where the prompt is located, then you will
    have to use

    ```nu
        ...
          event: {
            edit: insertstring
            value: "MY NEW STRING"
          }
        ...
    ```

    or say you want to move right until the first `S`

    ```nu
        ...
          event: {
            edit: moverightuntil
            value: "S"
          }
        ...
    ```

    As you can see, these two types will allow you to construct any type of
    keybinding that you require

    ### Until Type

    To complete this keybinding tour we need to discuss the `until` type for event.
    As you have seen so far, you can send a single event or a list of events. And
    as we have seen, when a list of events is sent, each and every one of them is
    processed.

    However, there may be cases when you want to assign different events to the
    same keybinding. This is especially useful with Nushell menus. For example, say
    you still want to activate your completion menu with `Ctrl + t` but you also
    want to move to the next element in the menu once it is activated using the
    same keybinding.

    For these cases, we have the `until` keyword. The events listed inside the
    until event will be processed one by one with the difference that as soon as
    one is successful, the event processing is stopped.

    The next keybinding represents this case.

    ```nu
      $env.config = {
        ...

        keybindings: [
          {
            name: completion_menu
            modifier: control
            keycode: char_t
            mode: emacs
            event: {
              until: [
                { send: menu name: completion_menu }
                { send: menunext }
              ]
            }
          }
        ]

        ...
      }
    ```

    The previous keybinding will first try to open a completion menu. If the menu
    is not active, it will activate it and send a success signal. If the keybinding
    is pressed again, since there is an active menu, then the next event it will
    send is MenuNext, which means that it will move the selector to the next
    element in the menu.

    As you can see the `until` keyword allows us to define two events for the same
    keybinding. At the moment of this writing, only the Menu events allow this type
    of layering. The other non menu event types will always return a success value,
    meaning that the `until` event will stop as soon as it reaches the command.

    For example, the next keybinding will always send a `down` because that event
    is always successful

    ```nu
      $env.config = {
        ...

        keybindings: [
          {
            name: completion_menu
            modifier: control
            keycode: char_t
            mode: emacs
            event: {
              until: [
                { send: down }
                { send: menu name: completion_menu }
                { send: menunext }
              ]
            }
          }
        ]

        ...
      }
    ```

    ### Removing a Default Keybinding

    If you want to remove a certain default keybinding without replacing it with a different action, you can set `event: null`.

    e.g. to disable screen clearing with `Ctrl + l` for all edit modes

    ```nu
      $env.config = {
        ...

        keybindings: [
          {
            modifier: control
            keycode: char_l
            mode: [emacs, vi_normal, vi_insert]
            event: null
          }
        ]

        ...
      }
    ```

    ### Troubleshooting Keybinding Problems

    Your terminal environment may not always propagate your key combinations on to Nushell the way you expect it to. You can use the command [`keybindings listen`](/commands/docs/keybindings_listen.md) to determine if certain keypresses are actually received by Nushell, and how.

    ## Menus

    Thanks to Reedline, Nushell has menus that can help you with your day to day
    shell scripting. Next we present the default menus that are always available
    when using Nushell

    ### Menu Keybindings

    When a menu is active, some keybindings change based on the keybinding [`until` specifier](#until-type) discussed above. Common keybindings for menus are:

    | Key                             | Event                |
    | ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
    | <kbd>Tab</kbd>                  | Select next item     |
    | <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> | Select previous item |
    | <kbd>Enter</kbd>                | Accept selection     |
    | <kbd>↑</kbd> (Up Arrow)         | Move menu up         |
    | <kbd>↓</kbd> (Down Arrow)       | Move menu down       |
    | <kbd>←</kbd> (Left Arrow)       | Move menu left       |
    | <kbd>→</kbd> (Right Arrow)      | Move menu right      |
    | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>    | Move menu up         |
    | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>    | Move menu down       |
    | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>    | Move menu left       |
    | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>    | Move menu right      |

    ::: note
    Menu direction behavior varies based on the menu type (see below). For example,
    in a `description` menu, "Up" and "Down" apply to the "Extra" list, but in a
    `list` menu the directions apply to the selection.
    :::

    ### Help Menu

    The help menu is there to ease your transition into Nushell. Say you are
    putting together an amazing pipeline and then you forgot the internal command
    that would reverse a string for you. Instead of deleting your pipe, you can
    activate the help menu with `F1`. Once active just type keywords for the
    command you are looking for and the menu will show you commands that match your
    input. The matching is done on the name of the commands or the commands
    description.

    To navigate the menu you can select the next element by using `tab`, you can
    scroll the description by pressing left or right and you can even paste into
    the line the available command examples.

    The help menu can be configured by modifying the next parameters

    ```nu
      $env.config = {
        ...

        menus = [
          ...
          {
            name: help_menu
            only_buffer_difference: true # Search is done on the text written after activating the menu
            marker: "? "                 # Indicator that appears with the menu is active
            type: {
                layout: description      # Type of menu

          ...
        ]
        ...
    ```

    ### Completion Menu

    The completion menu is a context sensitive menu that will present suggestions
    based on the status of the prompt. These suggestions can range from path
    suggestions to command alternatives. While writing a command, you can activate
    the menu to see available flags for an internal command. Also, if you have
    defined your custom completions for external commands, these will appear in the
    menu as well.

    The completion menu by default is accessed by pressing `tab` and it can be configured by
    modifying these values from the config object:

    ```nu
      $env.config = {
        ...

        menus: [
          ...
          {
            name: completion_menu
            only_buffer_difference: false # Search is done on the text written after activating the menu
            marker: "| "                  # Indicator that appears with the menu is active
            type: {
                layout: columnar          # Type of menu
                columns: 4                # Number of columns where the options are displayed
                col_width: 20             # Optional value. If missing all the screen width is used to calculate column width
                col_padding: 2            # Padding between columns
            }
            style: {
                text: green                   # Text style
                selected_text: green_reverse  # Text style for selected option
                description_text: yellow      # Text style for description
            }
          }
          ...
        ]
        ...
    ```

    By modifying these parameters you can customize the layout of your menu to your
    liking.

    ### History Menu

    The history menu is a handy way to access the editor history. When activating
    the menu (default `Ctrl+r`) the command history is presented in reverse
    chronological order, making it extremely easy to select a previous command.

    The history menu can be configured by modifying these values from the config object:

    ```nu
      $env.config = {
        ...

        menus = [
          ...
          {
            name: history_menu
            only_buffer_difference: true # Search is done on the text written after activating the menu
            marker: "? "                 # Indicator that appears with the menu is active
            type: {
                layout: list             # Type of menu
                page_size: 10            # Number of entries that will presented when activating the menu
            }
            style: {
                text: green                   # Text style
                selected_text: green_reverse  # Text style for selected option
                description_text: yellow      # Text style for description
            }
          }
          ...
        ]
        ...
    ```

    When the history menu is activated, it pulls `page_size` records from the
    history and presents them in the menu. If there is space in the terminal, when
    you press `Ctrl+x` again the menu will pull the same number of records and
    append them to the current page. If it isn't possible to present all the pulled
    records, the menu will create a new page. The pages can be navigated by
    pressing `Ctrl+z` to go to previous page or `Ctrl+x` to go to next page.

    #### Searching the History

    To search in your history you can start typing key words for the command you
    are looking for. Once the menu is activated, anything that you type will be
    replaced by the selected command from your history. for example, say that you
    have already typed this

    ```nu
    let a = ()
    ```

    you can place the cursor inside the `()` and activate the menu. You can filter
    the history by typing key words and as soon as you select an entry, the typed
    words will be replaced

    ```nu
    let a = (ls | where size > 10MiB)
    ```

    #### Menu Quick Selection

    Another nice feature of the menu is the ability to quick select something from
    it. Say you have activated your menu and it looks like this

    ```nu
    >
    0: ls | where size > 10MiB
    1: ls | where size > 20MiB
    2: ls | where size > 30MiB
    3: ls | where size > 40MiB
    ```

    Instead of pressing down to select the fourth entry, you can type `!3` and
    press enter. This will insert the selected text in the prompt position, saving
    you time scrolling down the menu.

    History search and quick selection can be used together. You can activate the
    menu, do a quick search, and then quick select using the quick selection
    character.

    ### User Defined Menus

    In case you find that the default menus are not enough for you and you have
    the need to create your own menu, Nushell can help you with that.

    In order to add a new menu that fulfills your needs, you can use one of the default
    layouts as a template. The templates available in nushell are columnar, list or
    description.

    The columnar menu will show you data in a columnar fashion adjusting the column
    number based on the size of the text displayed in your columns.

    The list type of menu will always display suggestions as a list, giving you the
    option to select values using `!` plus number combination.

    The description type will give you more space to display a description for some
    values, together with extra information that could be inserted into the buffer.

    Let's say we want to create a menu that displays all the variables created
    during your session, we are going to call it `vars_menu`. This menu will use a
    list layout (layout: list). To search for values, we want to use only the things
    that are written after the menu has been activated (only_buffer_difference:
    true).

    With that in mind, the desired menu would look like this

    ```nu
      $env.config = {
        ...

        menus = [
          ...
          {
            name: vars_menu
            only_buffer_difference: true
            marker: "# "
            type: {
                layout: list
                page_size: 10
            }
            style: {
                text: green
                selected_text: green_reverse
                description_text: yellow
            }
            source: { |buffer, position|
                scope variables
                | where name =~ $buffer
                | sort-by name
                | each { |row| {value: $row.name description: $row.type} }
            }
          }
          ...
        ]
        ...
    ```

    As you can see, the new menu is identical to the `history_menu` previously
    described. The only huge difference is the new field called [`source`](/commands/docs/source.md). The
    [`source`](/commands/docs/source.md) field is a nushell definition of the values you want to display in the
    menu. For this menu we are extracting the data from `scope variables` and we
    are using it to create records that will be used to populate the menu.

    The required structure for the record is the next one

    ```nu
    {
      value:       # The value that will be inserted in the buffer
      description: # Optional. Description that will be display with the selected value
      span: {      # Optional. Span indicating what section of the string will be replaced by the value
        start:
        end:
      }
      extra: [string] # Optional. A list of strings that will be displayed with the selected value. Only works with a description menu
    }
    ```

    For the menu to display something, at least the `value` field has to be present
    in the resulting record.

    In order to make the menu interactive, these two variables are available in
    the block: `$buffer` and `$position`. The `$buffer` contains the value captured
    by the menu, when the option `only_buffer_difference` is true, `$buffer` is the
    text written after the menu was activated. If `only_buffer_difference` is
    false, `$buffer` is all the string in line. The `$position` variable can be
    used to create replacement spans based on the idea you had for your menu. The
    value of `$position` changes based on whether `only_buffer_difference` is true
    or false. When true, `$position` is the starting position in the string where
    text was inserted after the menu was activated. When the value is false,
    `$position` indicates the actual cursor position.

    Using this information, you can design your menu to present the information you
    require and to replace that value in the location you need it. The only thing
    extra that you need to play with your menu is to define a keybinding that will
    activate your brand new menu.

    ### Menu Keybindings

    In case you want to change the default way both menus are activated, you can
    change that by defining new keybindings. For example, the next two keybindings
    assign the completion and history menu to `Ctrl+t` and `Ctrl+y` respectively

    ```nu
      $env.config = {
        ...

        keybindings: [
          {
            name: completion_menu
            modifier: control
            keycode: char_t
            mode: [vi_insert vi_normal]
            event: {
              until: [
                { send: menu name: completion_menu }
                { send: menupagenext }
              ]
            }
          }
          {
            name: history_menu
            modifier: control
            keycode: char_y
            mode: [vi_insert vi_normal]
            event: {
              until: [
                { send: menu name: history_menu }
                { send: menupagenext }
              ]
            }
          }
        ]

        ...
      }

    # Configuration

    ## Quickstart

    While Nushell provides many options for managing its startup and configuration, new users
    can get started with just a few simple steps:

    1. Tell Nushell what editor to use:

       ```nu
       $env.config.buffer_editor = <path_to_your_preferred_editor>
       ```

       For example:

       ```nu
       $env.config.buffer_editor = "code"
       # or
       $env.config.buffer_editor = "nano"
       # or
       $env.config.buffer_editor = "hx"
       # or
       $env.config.buffer_editor = "vi"
       # with args
       $env.config.buffer_editor = ["emacsclient", "-s", "light", "-t"]
       # etc.
       ```

    2. Edit `config.nu` using:

       ```nu
       config nu
       ```

       This will open the current `config.nu` in the editor defined above.

    3. Add commands to this file that should run each time Nushell starts. A good first example might be the `buffer_editor` setting above.

       You can find a detailed list of available settings using:

       ```nu
        config nu --doc | nu-highlight | less -R
       ```

    4. Save, exit the editor, and start a new Nushell session to load these settings.

    That's it! More details are below when you need them ...

    Documentation text:

    ## Configuration Overview

    Nushell uses multiple, optional configuration files. These files are loaded in the following order:

    1. The first file loaded is `env.nu`, which was historically used to override environment variables. However, the current "best-practice" recommendation is to set all environment variables (and other configuration) using `config.nu` and the autoload directories below.

    2. `config.nu` is typically used to override default Nushell settings, define (or import) custom commands, or run any other startup tasks.
    3. `*.nu` files in `$nu.vendor-autoload-dirs` are loaded. These directories are intended for vendors' and package managers' startup files.
    4. `*.nu` files in `$nu.user-autoload-dirs` are loaded. These files may be used for any startup tasks and are a good way to modularize the configuration.
    5. `login.nu` runs commands or handles configuration that should only take place when Nushell is running as a login shell.

    By default, `env.nu`, `config.nu`, and `login.nu` are read from the `$nu.default-config-dir` directory. For example:

    ```nu
    $nu.default-config-dir
    # macOS
    # => /Users/me/Library/Application Support/nushell
    # Linux
    # => /home/me/.config/nushell
    # Windows
    # => C:\Users\me\AppData\Roaming\nushell
    ```

    The first time Nushell is launched, it will create the configuration directory and an empty (other than comments) `env.nu` and `config.nu`.

    ::: tip
    You can quickly open `config.nu` in your default text editor using the `config nu` command. Likewise, the `config env` command will open `env.nu`.

    This requires that you have configured a default editor using either:

    - Nushell's `$env.config.buffer_editor` setting
    - The `$env.VISUAL` or `$env.EDITOR` environment variables

    For example, place this in your `config.nu` to edit your files in Visual Studio Code:

    ```nu
    $env.config.buffer_editor = 'code'
    ```

    Documentation text:

    ## Common Configuration Tasks in `config.nu`:

    ::: tip
    Some users will prefer a "monolithic" configuration file with most or all startup tasks in one place. `config.nu` can be used for this purpose.

    Other users may prefer a "modular" configuration where each file handles a smaller, more focused set of tasks. Files in the autoload dirs can be used to create this experience.
    :::

    `config.nu` is commonly used to:

    - Set [environment variables](#set-environment-variables) for Nushell and other applications
    - Set Nushell settings in [`$env.config`](#nushell-settings-in-the-envconfig-record)
    - Load modules or source files so that their commands are readily available
    - Run any other applications or commands at startup

    ## Set Environment Variables

    ::: tip See Also
    The [Environment](./environment.md) Chapter covers additional information on how to set and access environment variables.
    :::

    ### Path Configuration

    As with most shells, Nushell searches the environment variable named `PATH` (or variants).

    :::tip
    Unlike some shells, Nushell attempts to be "case agnostic" with environment variables. `Path`, `path`, `PATH`, and even `pAtH` are all allowed variants of the same environment variable. See [Environment - Case Sensitivity](./environment.md#case-sensitivity) for details.
    :::

    When Nushell is launched, it usually inherits the `PATH` as a string. However, Nushell automatically converts this to a Nushell list for easy access. This means that you can _append_ to the path using, for example:

    ```nu
    $env.path ++= ["~/.local/bin"]
    ```

    The Standard Library also includes a helper command. The default `path add` behavior is to _prepend_
    a directory so that it has higher precedence than the rest of the path. For example, the following can be
    added to your startup config:

    ```nu
    use std/util "path add"
    path add "~/.local/bin"
    path add ($env.CARGO_HOME | path join "bin")
    ```

    ::: tip
    Notice the use of `path join` in the example above. This command properly joins two path
    components regardless of whether or not the path separator is present. See `help path` for
    more commands in this category.
    :::

    ### Prompt Configuration

    Nushell provides a number of prompt configuration options. By default, Nushell includes:

    - A prompt which includes the current directory, abbreviated using `~` if it is (or is under)
      the home directory.
    - A prompt indicator which appears immediately to the right of the prompt. This defaults to `> ` when in normal editing mode, or a `: ` when in Vi-insert mode. Note extra space after the character to provide separation of the command from the prompt.
    - A right-prompt with the date and time
    - An indicator which is displayed when the current commandline extends over multiple lines - `::: ` by default

    The environment variables which control these prompt components are:

    - `$env.PROMPT_COMMAND`: The prompt itself
    - `$env.PROMPT_COMMAND_RIGHT`: A prompt which can appear on the right side of the terminal
    - `$env.PROMPT_INDICATOR`: Emacs mode indicator
    - `$env.PROMPT_INDICATOR_VI_NORMAL`: Vi-normal mode indicator
    - `$env.PROMPT_INDICATOR_VI_INSERT`: Vi-insert mode indicator
    - `$env.PROMPT_MULTILINE_INDICATOR`: The multi-line indicator

    Each of these variables accepts either:

    - A string, in which case the component will be statically displayed as that string.
    - A closure (with no parameters), in which case the component will be dynamically displayed based on the closure's code.
    - `null`, in which case the component will revert to its internal default value.

    ::: tip
    To disable the right-prompt, for instance, add the following to your startup config:

    ```nu
    $env.PROMPT_COMMAND_RIGHT = ""
    # or
    $env.PROMPT_COMMAND_RIGHT = {||}
    ```

    :::

    #### Transient Prompts

    Nushell also supports transient prompts, which allow a different prompt to be shown _after_ a commandline has been executed. This can be useful in several situations:

    - When using a multi-line prompt, the transient prompt can be a more condensed version.
    - Removing the transient multiline indicator and right-prompt can simplify copying from the terminal.

    As with the normal prompt commands above, each transient prompt can accept a (static) string, a (dynamic) closure, or a `null` to use the Nushell internal defaults.

    The environment variables which control the transient prompt components are:

    - `$env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_COMMAND`: The prompt itself after the commandline has been executed
    - `$env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_COMMAND_RIGHT`: A prompt which can appear on the right side of the terminal
    - `$env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_INDICATOR`: Emacs mode indicator
    - `$env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_INDICATOR_VI_NORMAL`: Vi-normal mode indicator
    - `$env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_INDICATOR_VI_INSERT`: Vi-insert mode indicator
    - `$env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_MULTILINE_INDICATOR`: The multi-line indicator

    ::: tip
    Nushell sets `TRANSIENT_PROMPT_COMMAND_RIGHT` and `TRANSIENT_PROMPT_MULTILINE_INDICATOR` to an empty string (`""`) so that each disappears after the previous command is entered. This simplifies copying and pasting from the terminal.

    To disable this feature and always show those items, set:

    ```nu
    $env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_COMMAND_RIGHT = null
    $env.TRANSIENT_PROMPT_MULTILINE_INDICATOR = null
    ```

    :::

    ### ENV_CONVERSIONS

    Certain variables, such as those containing multiple paths, are often stored as a
    colon-separated string in other shells. Nushell can convert these automatically to a
    more convenient Nushell list. The ENV_CONVERSIONS variable specifies how environment
    variables are:

    - converted from a string to a value on Nushell startup (from_string)
    - converted from a value back to a string when running external commands (to_string)

    `ENV_CONVERSIONS` is a record, where:

    - each key is an environment variable to be converted
    - each value is another record containing a:
      ```nu
      {
        from_string: <closure>
        to_string: <closure>
      }
      ```

    ::: tip
    As mentioned above, the OS Path variable is automatically converted by Nushell. As a result, it can be treated as a list within your startup config without needing to be present in `ENV_CONVERSIONS`. Other colon-separated paths, like `XDG_DATA_DIRS`, are not automatically converted.
    :::

    To add an additional conversion, [`merge`](/commands/docs/merge.md) it into the `$env.ENV_CONVERSIONS` record. For example, to add a conversion for the `XDG_DATA_DIRS` variable:

    ```nu
    $env.ENV_CONVERSIONS = $env.ENV_CONVERSIONS | merge {
        "XDG_DATA_DIRS": {
            from_string: {|s| $s | split row (char esep) | path expand --no-symlink }
            to_string: {|v| $v | path expand --no-symlink | str join (char esep) }
        }
    }
    ```

    ### `LS_COLORS`

    As with many `ls`-like utilities, Nushell's directory listings make use of the `LS_COLORS` environment variable for defining styles/colors to apply to certain file types and patterns.

    ## Nushell Settings in the `$env.config` Record

    ### Changing Settings in the `$env.config` Record

    The primary mechanism for changing Nushell's behavior is the `$env.config` record. While this record is accessed as an environment variable, unlike most other variables it is:

    - Not inherited from the parent process. Instead, it is populated by Nushell itself with certain defaults.
    - Not exported to child processes started by Nushell.

    To examine the current settings in `$env.config`, just type the variable name:

    ```nu
    $env.config
    ```

    ::: tip
    Since Nushell provides so many customization options, it may be better to send this to a pager like:

    ```nu
    $env.config | table -e | less -R
    # or, if bat is installed:
    $env.config | table -e | bat -p
    ```

    :::

    An appendix documenting each setting will be available soon. In the meantime, abbreviated documentation on each setting can be viewed in Nushell using:

    ```nu
    config nu --doc | nu-highlight | bat
    # or
    config nu --doc | nu-highlight | less -R
    ```

    To avoid overwriting existing settings, it's best to simply assign updated values to the desired configuration keys, rather than the entire `config` record. In other words:

    ::: warning Wrong

    ```nu
    $env.config = {
      show_banner: false
    }
    ```

    This would reset any _other_ settings that had been changed, since the entire record would be overwritten.
    :::

    ::: tip Right

    ```nu
    $env.config.show_banner = false
    ```

    This changes _only_ the `show_banner` key/value pair, leaving all other keys with their existing values.
    :::

    Certain keys are themselves also records. It's okay to overwrite these records, but it's best-practice
    to set all values when doing so. For example:

    ```nu
    $env.config.history = {
      file_format: sqlite
      max_size: 1_000_000
      sync_on_enter: true
      isolation: true
    }
    ```

    ### Remove Welcome Message

    :::note
    This section is linked directly from the banner message, so it repeats some information from above.
    :::

    To remove the welcome message that displays each time Nushell starts:

    1. Type `config nu` to edit your configuration file.
    2. If you receive an error regarding the editor not being defined:

       ```nu
       $env.config.buffer_editor = <path to your preferred editor>
       # Such as:
       $env.config.buffer_editor = "code"
       $env.config.buffer_editor = "vi"
       # Or with editor arguments:
       $env.config.buffer_editor = ["emacsclient", "-s", "light", "-t"]
       ```

       Then repeat step 1.

    3. Add the following line to the end of the file:

       ```nu
       $env.config.show_banner = false
       ```

    4. Save and exit your editor.
    5. Restart Nushell to test the change.

    ## Additional Startup Configuration

    ### Changing default directories

    ::: warning Important
    As discussed below, variables in this section must be set **before** Nushell is launched.
    :::

    Some variables that control Nushell startup file locations must be set **before** Nushell is loaded. This is often done by a parent process such as:

    - The terminal application in which Nushell is run

    - The operating system or window manager. When running Nushell as a login shell, this will likely be the only mechanism available.

      For example, on Windows, you can set environment variables through the Control Panel. Choose the Start Menu and search for _"environment variables"_.

      On Linux systems using PAM, `/etc/environment` (and other system-specific mechanisms) can be used.

    - A parent shell. For example, exporting the value from `bash` before running `nu`.

    ### Startup Variables

    The variables that affect Nushell file locations are:

    - `$env.XDG_CONFIG_HOME`: If this environment variable is set, it is used to change the directory that Nushell searches for its configuration files such as `env.nu`, `config.nu`, `login.nu`, and the `<config>/autoload` directory. The history and plugin files are also stored in this directory by default.

      Once Nushell starts, this value is stored in the `$nu.default-config-dir` constant. See [Using Constants](#using-constants) below.

    - `$env.XDG_DATA_HOME`: If this environment variable is set, Nushell sets the `$nu.data-dir` constant to this value. The `data-dir` is used in several startup tasks:

      - `($nu.data-dir)/nushell/completions` is added to the `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS` search path.
      - `($nu.data-dir)/vendor/autoload` is added as the last path in `nu.vendor-autoload-dirs`. Files in this directory will be read after the other vendor-auto-load directories, thus overriding any of their settings.

      Note that the directory represented by `$nu.data-dir`, nor any of its subdirectories, are created by default. Creation and use of these directories is up to the user.

    - `$env.XDG_DATA_DIRS` _(Unix Platforms Only)_: If this environment variable is set, it is used to populate the `$nu.vendor-auto-load` directories in the order listed. The first directory in the list is processed first, meaning the last one read will have the ability to override previous definitions.

    ::: warning
    The `XDG_*` variables are **not** Nushell-specific and should not be set to a directory with only Nushell files. Instead, set the environment variable to the directory _above_ the one with the `nushell` directory.

    For example, if you set `$env.XDG_CONFIG_HOME` to:

    ```
    /users/username/dotfiles/nushell
    ```

    ... Nushell will look for config files in `/Users/username/dotfiles/nushell/nushell`. The proper setting would be:

    ```
    /users/username/dotfiles
    ```

    Also keep in mind that if the system has already set `XDG` variables, then there may already be files in use in those directories. Changing the location may require that you move other application's files to the new directory.
    :::

    ::: tip
    You can easily test out config changes in a "fresh" environment using the following recipe. The following is run from inside Nushell, but can be
    adapted to other shells as well:

    ```nu
    # Create an empty temporary directory
    let temp_home = (mktemp -d)
    # Set the configuration path to this directory
    $env.XDG_CONFIG_HOME = $temp_home
    # Set the data-dir to this directory
    $env.XDG_DATA_HOME = $temp_home
    # Remove other potential autoload directories
    $env.XDG_DATA_HOME = ""
    # Run Nushell in this environment
    nu

    # Edit config
    config nu
    # Exit the subshell
    exit
    # Run the temporary config
    nu
    ```

    When done testing the configuration:

    ```nu
    # Remove the temporary config directory, if desired
    rm $temp_home
    ```

    **Important:** Then exit the parent shell so that the `XDG` changes are not accidentally propagated to other processes.
    :::

    ### Using Constants

    Some important commands, like `source` and `use`, that help define custom commands (and other definitions) are parse-time keywords. Among other things, this means means that all arguments must be known at parse-time.

    In other words, **_variable arguments are not allowed for parser keywords_**.

    However, Nushell creates some convenience _constants_ that can be used to help identify common file locations. For instance, you can source a file in the default configuration directory using:

    ```nu
    source ($nu.default-config-dir | path join "myfile.nu")
    ```

    Because the constant value is known at parse-time, it can be used with parse-time keywords like `source` and `use`.

    :::tip See Also
    See [Parse-time Constant Evaluation](./how_nushell_code_gets_run.md#parse-time-constant-evaluation) for more details on this process.
    :::

    #### `$nu` Constant

    To see a list of the built-in Nushell constants, examine the record constant using `$nu` (including the dollar sign).

    #### `NU_LIB_DIRS` Constant

    Nushell can also make use of a `NU_LIB_DIRS` _constant_ which can act like the `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS` variable mentioned above. However, unlike `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS`, it can be defined _and_ used in `config.nu`. For example:

    ```nu
    # Define module and source search path
    const NU_LIB_DIRS = [
      '~/myscripts'
    ]
    # Load myscript.nu from the ~/myscripts directory
    source myscript.nu
    ```

    If both the variable `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS` and the const `NU_LIB_DIRS` are defined, both sets
    of paths will be searched. The constant `NU_LIB_DIRS` will be searched _first_ and have
    precedence. If a file matching the name is found in one of those directories, the search will
    stop. Otherwise, it will continue into the `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS` search path.

    #### `NU_PLUGIN_DIRS` Constant

    `const NU_PLUGIN_DIRS` works in the same way for the plugin search path.

    The following `NU_PLUGIN_DIRS` configuration will allow plugins to be loaded from;

    - The directory where the `nu` executable is located. This is typically where plugins are located in release packages.
    - A directory in `$nu.data-dirs` named after the version of Nushell running (e.g. `0.100.0`).
    - A `plugins` directory in your `$nu.config-path`.

    ```nu
    const NU_PLUGIN_DIRS = [
      ($nu.current-exe | path dirname)
      ($nu.data-dir | path join 'plugins' | path join (version).version)
      ($nu.config-path | path dirname | path join 'plugins')
    ]
    ```

    ### Colors, Theming, and Syntax Highlighting

    You can learn more about setting up colors and theming in the [associated chapter](coloring_and_theming.md).

    ### Configuring Nu as a Login Shell

    The login shell is often responsible for setting certain environment variables which will be inherited by subshells and other processes. When setting Nushell as a user's default login shell, you'll want to make sure that the `login.nu` handles this task.

    Many applications will assume a POSIX or PowerShell login shell, and will either provide instructions for modifying the system or user `profile` that is loaded by POSIX login-shells (or `.ps1` file on PowerShell systems).

    As you may have noticed by now, Nushell is not a POSIX shell, nor is it PowerShell, and it won't be able to process a profile written for these. You'll need to set these values in `login.nu` instead.

    To find environment variables that may need to be set through `login.nu`, examine the inherited environment from your login shell by running `nu` from within your previous login shell. Run:

    ```nu
    $env | reject config | transpose key val | each {|r| echo $"$env.($r.key) = '($r.val)'"} | str join (char nl)
    ```

    Look for any values that may be needed by third-party applications and copy these to your `login.nu`. Many of these will not be needed. For instance, the `PS1` setting is the current prompt in POSIX shells and won't be useful in Nushell.

    When ready, add Nushell to your `/etc/shells` (Unix) and `chsh` as discussed in [the Installation Chapter](./default_shell.md).

    ### macOS: Keeping `/usr/bin/open` as `open`

    Some tools such as Emacs rely on an [`open`](/commands/docs/open.md) command to open files on Mac.

    Since Nushell has its own [`open`](/commands/docs/open.md) command with a different meaning which shadows (overrides) `/usr/bin/open`, these tools will generate an error when trying to use the command.

    One way to work around this is to define a custom command for Nushell's [`open`](/commands/docs/open.md) and create an alias for the system's [`open`](/commands/docs/open.md) in your `config.nu` file like this:

    ```nu
    alias nu-open = open
    alias open = ^open
    ```

    Place this in your `config.nu` to make it permanent.

    The `^` symbol tells Nushell to run the following command as an _external_ command, rather than as a Nushell built-in. After running these commands, `nu-open` will be the Nushell _internal_ version, and the `open` alias will call the Mac, external `open` instead.

    For more information, see [Running System (External) Commands](./running_externals.md).

    ## Detailed Configuration Startup Process

    This section contains a more detailed description of how different configuration (and flag) options can be used to
    change Nushell's startup behavior.

    ### Launch Stages

    The following stages and their steps _may_ occur during startup, based on the flags that are passed to `nu`. See [Flag Behavior](#flag-behavior) immediately following this table for how each flag impacts the process:

    | Step | Stage                           | Nushell Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
    | ---- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | 0.   | (misc)                          | Sets internal defaults via its internal Rust implementation. In practice, this may not take place until "first use" of the setting or variable, but there will typically be a Rust default for most (but not all) settings and variables that control Nushell's behavior. These defaults can then be superseded by the steps below.                                            |
    | 1.   | (main)                          | Inherits its initial environment from the calling process. These will initially be converted to Nushell strings, but can be converted to other structures later using `ENV_CONVERSIONS` (see below).                                                                                                                                                                           |
    | 2.   | (main)                          | Gets the configuration directory. This is OS-dependent (see [dirs::config_dir](https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.config_dir.html)), but can be overridden using `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` on all platforms as discussed [above](#changing-default-directories).                                                                                                                      |
    | 3.   | (main)                          | Creates the initial `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS` variable. By default, it is an empty list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
    | 4.   | (main)                          | Creates the initial `$NU_LIB_DIRS` variable. By default, it includes (1) the `scripts` directory under the configuration directory, and (2) `nushell/completions` under the default data directory (either `$env.XDG_DATA_HOME` or [the default provided by the dirs crate](https://docs.rs/dirs/latest/dirs/fn.data_dir.html)). These directories are not created by default. |
    | 5.   | (main)                          | Creates the initial `$env.NU_PLUGIN_DIRS` variable. By default, it is an empty list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
    | 6.   | (main)                          | Creates the initial `$NU_PLUGIN_DIRS` variable. By default, this will include (1) the `plugins` directory under the configuration directory, and (2) the directory where the currently running `nu`/`nu.exe` is located.                                                                                                                                                       |
    | 7.   | (main)                          | Initializes the in-memory SQLite database. This allows the `stor` family of commands to be used in the following configuration files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
    | 8.   | (main)                          | Processes commandline arguments such as `--plugin-config <file>`, `--plugins <list>`, and others. See `nu --help` for a complete list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
    | 9.   | (main)                          | Gets the path to `env.nu` and `config.nu`. By default, these are located in the config directory, but either or both can be overridden using the `--env-config <path>` and `--config <path>` flags.                                                                                                                                                                            |

    | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Normal Shell        | `nu` (no flags)                            | All launch steps **_except_** those marked with **_(login)_** occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
    | Login Shell         | `nu --login/-l`                            | All launch steps occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
    | Command-string      | `nu --commands <command-string>` (or `-c`) | All Launch stages **_except_** those marked with **_(config files)_** or **_(repl)_** occur.

    # (Not so) Advanced

    While the "Advanced" title might sound daunting and you might be tempted to skip this chapter, in fact, some of the most interesting and powerful features can be found here.

    Besides the built-in commands, Nushell has a [standard library](standard_library.md).

    Nushell operates on _structured data_.
    You could say that Nushell is a "data-first" shell and a programming language.
    To further explore the data-centric direction, Nushell includes a full-featured dataframe processing engine using [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) as the backend.
    Make sure to check the [Dataframes documentation](dataframes.md) if you want to process large data efficiently directly in your shell.

    Values in Nushell contain some extra [metadata](metadata.md).
    This metadata can be used, for example, to [create custom errors](creating_errors.md).

    Thanks to Nushell's strict scoping rules, it is very easy to [iterate over collections in parallel](parallelism.md) which can help you speed up long-running scripts by just typing a few characters.

    You can [interactively explore data](explore.md) with the [`explore`](/commands/docs/explore.md) command.

    Finally, you can extend Nushell's functionality with [plugins](plugins.md).
    Almost anything can be a plugin as long as it communicates with Nushell in a protocol that Nushell understands.

    # Plugins

    Nu can be extended using plugins. Plugins behave much like Nu's built-in commands, with the added benefit that they can be added separately from Nu itself.

    ::: warning Important
    Plugins communicate with Nushell using the `nu-plugin` protocol. This protocol is versioned, and plugins must use the same `nu-plugin` version provided by Nushell.

    When updating Nushell, please make sure to also update any plugins that you have registered.
    :::

    [[toc]]

    ## Overview

    - In order to use a plugin, it needs to be:

      - Installed
      - Added
      - Imported

    There are two types of plugins:

    - "Core plugins" are officially maintained and are usually installed with Nushell, in the same directory as the Nushell executable.
    - Third-party plugins are also available from many sources.

    The `$NU_LIB_DIRS` constant or `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS` environment variable can be used to set the search-path for plugins.

    ### Core Plugin Quickstart

    To begin using the Polars plugin:

    1. Most package managers will automatically install the core plugins with Nushell. A notable exception, however, is `cargo`. If you installed
       Nushell using `cargo`, see [Installing Core Plugins](#core-plugins) below.

    2. (Recommended) Set the plugin search path to include the directory where Nushell and its plugins are installed. Assuming the core plugins are installed
       in the same directory as the Nushell binary, the following can be added to your startup config:

       ```nu
       const NU_PLUGIN_DIRS = [
         ($nu.current-exe | path dirname)
         ...$NU_PLUGIN_DIRS
       ]
       ```

    3. Add the plugin to the plugin registry. This only needs to be done one time. The name is the name of the plugin _file_, including its extension:

       ```nu
       # On Unix/Linux platforms:
       plugin add nu_plugin_polars
       # Or on Windows
       plugin add nu_plugin_polars.exe

       plugin list # Confirm it was added to the registry
       ```

       Alternatively, if you did not add the binary directory to the plugin path in Step 2, you can still use an absolute path:

       ```nu
       plugin add ~/.local/share/rust/cargo/bin/nu_plugin_polars
       ```

    4. Import the plugin (to begin using it immediately) or restart Nushell. All plugins in the registry are automatically imported when Nushell starts:

       ```nu
       # The name of the plugin, without the leading `nu_plugin` nor any extension
       use polars
       ```

    5. Confirm the plugin is working:

       ```nu
       ls | polars into-df | describe
       # => NuDataFrame
       ```

    ## Installing Plugins

    ### Core Plugins

    Nushell ships with a set of officially maintained plugins which includes:

    - `polars`: Extremely fast columnar operations using DataFrames via the [Polars Library](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars). See the [DataFrames Chapter](dataframes.html) for more details.
    - `formats`: Support for several additional data formats - EML, ICS, INI, plist, and VCF.
    - `gstat`: Returns information on the status of a Git repository as Nushell structured data.
    - `query`: Support for querying SQL, XML, JSON, HTML (via selector), and WebPage Metadata
    - `inc`: Increment a value or version (e.g., semver). This plugin acts as both an end-user plugin as well as a simple developer example of how to create a plugin.

    Nushell also ships with several plugins that serve as examples or tools for plugin developers. These include `nu_plugin_example`, `nu_plugin_custom_values`, and `nu_plugin_stress_internals`.

    Core plugins are typically distributed with the Nushell release and should already be installed in the same directory as the Nushell executable. If this is the case on your system, core plugins should be using correct `nu-plugin` protocol version. If your package management system installs them separately, please make sure to update the core plugins whenever Nushell itself is updated.

    ::: tip Installing using Cargo
    For example, when installing or upgrading Nushell directly from crates.io using `cargo install nu --locked`, the corresponding core plugins for that version may also be installed or updated using `cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin_name> --locked`.

    To install all of the default (non-developer) plugins, from within Nushell run:

    ```nu
    [ nu_plugin_inc
      nu_plugin_polars
      nu_plugin_gstat
      nu_plugin_formats
      nu_plugin_query
    ] | each { cargo install $in --locked } | ignore
    ```

    :::

    ### Third-party Plugins

    You can find third-party plugins on crates.io, online Git repositories, [`awesome-nu`](https://github.com/nushell/awesome-nu/blob/main/plugin_details.md), and other sources. As with any third-party code you run on your system, please make sure you trust its source.

    To install a third-party plugin on your system, you first need to make sure the plugin uses the same version of Nu as your system:

    - Confirm your Nushell version with the `version` command
    - Confirm the version the plugin requires by checking its `Cargo.toml` file

    To install a plugin by name from crates.io, run:

    ```nu
    cargo install nu_plugin_<plugin_name> --locked
    ```

    When installing from a repository (e.g., GitHub), run the following from inside the cloned repository:

    ```nu
    cargo install --path . --locked
    ```

    This will create a binary file that can be used to add the plugin.

    ::: tip Cargo installation location
    By default, binaries installed with `cargo install` are placed in your home directory under `.cargo/bin`.
    However, this can change depending on how your system is configured.
    :::

    ## Registering Plugins

    To add a plugin to the plugin registry file, call the [`plugin add`](/commands/docs/plugin_add.md) command to tell Nu where to find it.

    ::: tip Note
    The plugin file name must start with `nu_plugin_`, Nu uses this filename prefix to identify plugins.
    :::

    - Linux and macOS:

      ```nu
      plugin add ./my_plugins/nu_plugin_cool
      ```

    - Windows:

      ```nu
      plugin add .\my_plugins\nu_plugin_cool.exe
      ```

    When [`plugin add`](/commands/docs/plugin_add.md) is called, Nu:

    - Runs the plugin binary
    - Communicates via the [plugin protocol](/contributor-book/plugin_protocol_reference.md) in order to ensure compatibility and to get a list of all of the commands it supports
    - This plugin information is then saved to the plugin registry file (`$nu.plugin-path`), which acts as a cache

    ### Importing Plugins

    Once added to the registry, the next time `nu` is started, the plugin will be imported and available in that session.

    You can also immediately import (or reload) a plugin in the current session by calling `plugin use`. In this case, the name of the plugin (rather than the filename) is used without the `nu_plugin` prefix:

    ```nu
    plugin use cool
    ```

    It is not necessary to add `plugin use` statements to your config file. All previously registered plugins are automatically loaded at startup.

    ::: tip Note
    `plugin use` is a parser keyword, so when evaluating a script, it will be evaluated first. This means that while you can execute `plugin add` and then `plugin use` at the REPL on separate lines, you can't do this in a single script. If you need to run `nu` with a specific plugin or set of plugins without preparing a cache file, you can pass the `--plugins` option to `nu` with a list of plugin executable files:

    ```nu
    nu --plugins '[./my_plugins/nu_plugin_cool]'
    ```

    :::

    ### Plugin Search Path

    Nushell includes two `list` variables that can be used to set a search path for plugins. This only applies when registering plugins with `plugin add`, but it can be a nice shortcut
    if you commonly add and remove plugins.

    - `const NU_PLUGIN_DIRS`: A constant which takes effect immediately when set. However, as a constant, only certain commands may be used with it. It can be updated, for example, as seen in the [QuickStart above](#core-plugin-quickstart).
    - `$env.NU_PLUGIN_DIRS`: An environment variable which is mutable and can accept any command that updates its list. However, changes to it will not take effect until the _next_ expression is parsed.

    ### Updating Plugins

    When updating a plugin, it is important to run `plugin add` again just as above to load the new signatures from the plugin and allow Nu to rewrite them to the plugin file (`$nu.plugin-path`). You can then `plugin use` to get the updated signatures within the current session.

    ## Managing Plugins

    Installed plugins are displayed using [`plugin list`](/commands/docs/plugin_list.md):

    ╰───┴─────────┴────────────┴─────────┴───────────────────────┴───────┴───────────────────────────────╯
    ```

    All of the commands from installed plugins are available in the current scope:

    ```nu
    scope commands | where type == "plugin"
    ```

    ### Plugin Lifecycle

    Plugins stay running while they are in use, and are automatically stopped by default after a period of time of inactivity. This behavior is managed by the [plugin garbage collector](#plugin-garbage-collector). To manually stop a plugin, call `plugin stop` with its name:

    For example, run the `gstat` command from the corresponding plugin, then check its `is_running` status:

    ```nu
    gstat
    # => gstat output
    plugin list | where name == gstat | select name is_running
    # =>
    ╭───┬───────┬────────────╮
    │ # │ name  │ is_running │
    ├───┼───────┼────────────┤
    │ 0 │ gstat │ true       │
    ╰───┴───────┴────────────╯
    ```

    Now stop the plugin manually, and we can see that it is no longer running:

    ```nu
    plugin stop gstat

    ### Plugin Garbage Collector

    As mentioned above, Nu comes with a plugin garbage collector which automatically stops plugins that are not actively in use after a period of time (by default, 10 seconds). This behavior is fully configurable:

    ```nu
    $env.config.plugin_gc = {
        # Settings for plugins not otherwise specified:
        default: {
            enabled: true # set to false to never automatically stop plugins
            stop_after: 10sec # how long to wait after the plugin is inactive before stopping it
        }
        # Settings for specific plugins, by plugin name
        # (i.e. what you see in `plugin list`):
        plugins: {
            gstat: {
                stop_after: 1min
            }
            inc: {
                stop_after: 0sec # stop as soon as possible
            }
            example: {
                enabled: false # never stop automatically
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    For information on when a plugin is considered to be active, see [the relevant section in the contributor book](/contributor-book/plugins.html#plugin-garbage-collection).

    ## Removing Plugins

    To remove a plugin, call `plugin rm <plugin_name>`. Note that this is the plugin name, rather than the filename. For example, if you previously added the plugin `~/.cargo/bin/nu_plugin_gstat`, its name would be `gstat`. To remove it:

    ```nu
    plugin rm gstat
    ```

    You can confirm the name of a plugin by running `plugin list`.

    Running `plugin rm` removes the plugin from the registry so that it will not be loaded the next time Nushell starts. However, any commands created by the plugin remain in scope until the current Nushell session ends.

    ## For Plugin Developers

    Nu plugins are executables; Nu launches them as needed and communicates with them over [stdin and stdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams) or [local sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication). Nu plugins can use either [JSON](https://www.json.org/) or [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) as their communication encoding.

    ### Examples

    Nu's main repo contains example plugins that are useful for learning how the plugin protocol works:

    - [Rust](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/tree/main/crates/nu_plugin_example)
    - [Python](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu_plugin_python)

    ### Debugging

    The simplest way to debug a plugin is to print to stderr; plugins' standard error streams are redirected through Nu and displayed to the user.

    #### Tracing

    The Nu plugin protocol message stream may be captured for diagnostic purposes using [trace_nu_plugin](https://crates.io/crates/trace_nu_plugin/).

    ::: warning
    Trace output will accumulate for as long as the plugin is installed with the trace wrapper. Large files are possible. Be sure to remove the plugin with `plugin rm` when finished tracing, and reinstall without the trace wrapper.\*\*

    ### Developer Help

    Nu's plugin documentation is a work in progress. If you're unsure about something, the #plugins channel on [the Nu Discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn) is a great place to ask questions!

    ### More details

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `working_with_strings page of the documentation provided by Nushell`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# Working with Strings\n\nAs with most languages, strings are a collection of 0 or more characters that represent text. This can include file names, file paths, names of columns,\nand much more. Strings are so common that Nushell offers multiple string formats to match your use-case:\n\n## String Formats at a Glance\n\n| Format of string                                     | Example                 | Escapes                   | Notes                                                                  |\n| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Single-quoted string](#single-quoted-strings)       | `'[^\\n]+'`              | None                      | Cannot contain single quotes within the string                         |\n| [Double-quoted string](#double-quoted-strings)       | `\"The\\nEnd\"`            | C-style backslash escapes | All literal backslashes must be escaped                                |\n| [Raw strings](#raw-strings)                          | `r#'Raw string'#`       | None                      | May include single quotes                                              |\n| [Bare word string](#bare-word-strings)               | `ozymandias`            | None                      | Can only contain \"word\" characters; Cannot be used in command position |\n| [Backtick string](#backtick-quoted-strings)          | <code>\\`[^\\n]+\\`</code> | None                      | Bare string that can include whitespace. Cannot contain any backticks  |\n| [Single-quoted interpolation](#string-interpolation) | `$'Captain ($name)'`    | None                      | Cannot contain any `'` or unmatched `()`                               |\n| [Double-quoted interpolation](#string-interpolation) | `$\"Captain ($name)\"`    | C-style backslash escapes | All literal backslashes and `()` must be escaped                       |\n\n## Single-quoted Strings\n\nThe simplest string in Nushell is the single-quoted string. This string uses the `'` character to surround some text. Here's the text for hello world as a single-quoted string:\n\n```nu\n'hello world'\n# => hello world\n'The\nend'\n# => The\n# => end\n```\n\nSingle-quoted strings don't do anything to the text they're given, making them ideal for holding a wide range of text data.\n\n## Double-quoted Strings\n\nFor more complex strings, Nushell also offers double-quoted strings. These strings use the `\"` character to surround text. They also support the ability escape characters inside the text using the `\\` character.\n\nFor example, we could write the text hello followed by a new line and then world, using escape characters and a double-quoted string:\n\n```nu\n\"hello\\nworld\"\n# => hello\n# => world\n```\n\nEscape characters let you quickly add in a character that would otherwise be hard to type.\n\nNushell currently supports the following escape characters:\n\n- `\\\"` - double-quote character\n- `\\'` - single-quote character\n- `\\\\` - backslash\n- `\\/` - forward slash\n- `\\b` - backspace\n- `\\f` - formfeed\n- `\\r` - carriage return\n- `\\n` - newline (line feed)\n- `\\t` - tab\n- `\\u{X...}` - a single unicode character, where X... is 1-6 hex digits (0-9, A-F)\n\n## Raw Strings\n\nRaw strings behave the same as a single quoted strings, except that raw strings\nmay also contain single quotes. This is possible because raw strings are enclosed\nby a starting `r#'` and a closing `'#`. This syntax should look familiar to users\nof Rust.\n\n```nu\nr#'Raw strings can contain 'quoted' text.'#\n# => Raw strings can contain 'quoted' text.\n```\n\nAdditional `#` symbols can be added to the start and end of the raw string to enclose\none less than the same number of `#` symbols next to a `'` symbol in the string. This can\nbe used to nest raw strings:\n\n```nu\nr###'r##'This is an example of a raw string.'##'###\n# => r##'This is an example of a raw string.'##\n```\n\n## Bare Word Strings\n\nLike other shell languages (but unlike most other programming languages) strings consisting of a single 'word' can also be written without any quotes:\n\n```nu\nprint hello\n# => hello\n[hello] | describe\n# => list<string>\n```\n\nBut be careful - if you use a bare word plainly on the command line (that is, not inside a data structure or used as a command parameter) or inside round brackets `(` `)`, it will be interpreted as an external command:\n\n```nu\nhello\n# => Error: nu::shell::external_command\n# => \n# =>   × External command failed\n# =>    ╭─[entry #5:1:1]\n# =>  1 │ hello\n# =>    · ──┬──\n# =>    ·   ╰── executable was not found\n# =>    ╰────\n# =>   help: program not found\n```\n\nAlso, many bare words have special meaning in nu, and so will not be interpreted as a string:\n\n```nu\ntrue | describe\n# => bool\n[true] | describe\n# => list<bool>\n[trueX] | describe\n# => list<string>\ntrueX | describe\n# => Error: nu::shell::external_command\n# => \n# =>   × External command failed\n# =>    ╭─[entry #5:1:1]\n# =>  1 │ trueX | describe\n# =>    · ──┬──\n# =>    ·   ╰── executable was not found\n# =>    ╰────\n# =>   help: program not found\n```\n\nSo, while bare strings are useful for informal command line usage, when programming more formally in nu, you should generally use quotes.\n\n## Backtick-quoted Strings\n\nBare word strings, by their nature, cannot include spaces or quotes. As an alternative, Nushell also includes backtick-quoted\nstrings using the <code>`</code> character. In most cases, these should operate the same as a bare word string.\n\nFor instance, as with a bare word, a backtick-quoted string in the first position of an expression will be interpreted as a _command_ or _path_.\nFor example:\n\n```nu\n# Run the external ls binary found on the path\n`ls`\n\n# Move up one directory\n`..`\n\n# Change to the \"my dir\" subdirectory, if it exists\n`./my dir`\n```\n\nBacktick-quoted strings can be useful for combining globs with files or directories which include spaces:\n\n```nu\nls `./my dir/*`\n```\n\nBacktick-quoted strings cannot contain _unmatched_ backticks in the string itself. For example:\n\n`````nu\necho ````\n``\n\necho ```\n# Unterminated string which will start a new line in the CLI\n`````\n\n## Strings as external commands\n\nYou can place the `^` sigil in front of any string (including a variable) to have Nushell execute the string as if it was an external command:\n\n```nu\n^'C:\\Program Files\\exiftool.exe'\n\nlet foo = 'C:\\Program Files\\exiftool.exe'\n^$foo\n```\n\nYou can also use the [`run-external`](/commands/docs/run-external.md) command for this purpose, which provides additional flags and options.\n\n## Appending and Prepending to strings\n\nThere are various ways to pre, or append strings. If you want to add something to the beginning of each string closures are a good option:\n\n```nu\n['foo', 'bar'] | each {|s| '~/' ++ $s} # ~/foo, ~/bar\n['foo', 'bar'] | each {|s| '~/' + $s} # ~/foo, ~/bar\n```\n\nYou can also use a regex to replace the beginning or end of a string:\n\n```nu\n['foo', 'bar'] | str replace -r '^' '~/'# ~/foo, ~/bar\n['foo', 'bar'] | str replace -r '$' '~/'# foo~/, bar~/\n```\n\nIf you want to get one string out of the end then `str join` is your friend:\n\n```nu\n\"hello\" | append \"world!\" | str join \" \" # hello world!\n```\n\nYou can also use reduce:\n\n```nu\n1..10 | reduce -f \"\" {|elt, acc| $acc + ($elt | into string) + \" + \"} # 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 +\n```\n\nThough in the cases of strings, especially if you don't have to operate on the strings, it's usually easier and more correct (notice the extra + at the end in the example above) to use `str join`.\n\nFinally you could also use string interpolation, but that is complex enough that it is covered in its own subsection below.\n\n## String interpolation\n\nMore complex string use cases also need a new form of string: string interpolation. This is a way of building text from both raw text and the result of running expressions. String interpolation combines the results together, giving you a new string.\n\nString interpolation uses `$\" \"` and `$' '` as ways to wrap interpolated text.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a variable called `$name` and we want to greet the name of the person contained in this variable:\n\n```nu\nlet name = \"Alice\"\n$\"greetings, ($name)\"\n# => greetings, Alice\n```\n\nBy wrapping expressions in `()`, we can run them to completion and use the results to help build the string.\n\nString interpolation has both a single-quoted, `$' '`, and a double-quoted, `$\" \"`, form. These correspond to the single-quoted and double-quoted strings: single-quoted string interpolation doesn't support escape characters while double-quoted string interpolation does.\n\nAs of version 0.61, interpolated strings support escaping parentheses, so that the `(` and `)` characters may be used in a string without Nushell trying to evaluate what appears between them:\n\n```nu\n$\"2 + 2 is (2 + 2) \\(you guessed it!)\"\n# => 2 + 2 is 4 (you guessed it!)\n```\n\nInterpolated strings can be evaluated at parse time, but if they include values whose formatting depends\non your configuration and your `config.nu` hasn't been loaded yet, they will use the default configuration.\nSo if you have something like this in your `config.nu`, `x` will be `\"2.0 KB\"` even if your config says to use\n`MB` for all file sizes (datetimes will similarly use the default config).\n\n```nu\nconst x = $\"(2kb)\"\n```\n\n## Splitting Strings\n\nThe [`split row`](/commands/docs/split_row.md) command creates a list from a string based on a delimiter.\n\n```nu\n\"red,green,blue\" | split row \",\"\n# => ╭───┬───────╮\n# => │ 0 │ red   │\n# => │ 1 │ green │\n# => │ 2 │ blue  │\n# => ╰───┴───────╯\n```\n\nThe [`split column`](/commands/docs/split_column.md) command will create a table from a string based on a delimiter. This applies generic column names to the table.\n\n```nu\n\"red,green,blue\" | split column \",\"\n# => ╭───┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────╮\n# => │ # │ column1 │ column2 │ column3 │\n# => ├───┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤\n# => │ 0 │ red     │ green   │ blue    │\n# => ╰───┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────╯\n```\n\nFinally, the [`split chars`](/commands/docs/split_chars.md) command will split a string into a list of characters.\n\n```nu\n'aeiou' | split chars\n# => ╭───┬───╮\n# => │ 0 │ a │\n# => │ 1 │ e │\n# => │ 2 │ i │\n# => │ 3 │ o │\n# => │ 4 │ u │\n# => ╰───┴───╯\n```\n\n## The [`str`](/commands/docs/str.md) command\n\nMany string functions are subcommands of the [`str`](/commands/docs/str.md) command. You can get a full list using `help str`.\n\nFor example, you can look if a string contains a particular substring using [`str contains`](/commands/docs/str_contains.md):\n\n```nu\n\"hello world\" | str contains \"o wo\"\n# => true\n```\n\n(You might also prefer, for brevity, the `=~` operator (described below).)\n\n### Trimming Strings\n\nYou can trim the sides of a string with the [`str trim`](/commands/docs/str_trim.md) command. By default, the [`str trim`](/commands/docs/str_trim.md) commands trims whitespace from both sides of the string. For example:\n\n```nu\n'       My   string   ' | str trim\n# => My   string\n```\n\nYou can specify on which side the trimming occurs with the `--right` and `--left` options. (`-r` and `-l` being the short-form options respectively)\n\nTo trim a specific character, use `--char <Character>` or `-c <Character>` to specify the character to trim.\n\nHere's an example of all the options in action:\n\n```nu\n'=== Nu shell ===' | str trim -r -c '='\n# => === Nu shell\n```\n\n### Substrings\n\nSubstrings are slices of a string. They have a startpoint and an endpoint. Here's an example of using a substring:\n\n```nu\n'Hello World!' | str index-of 'o'\n# => 4\n'Hello World!' | str index-of 'r'\n# => 8\n'Hello World!' | str substring 4..8\n# => o Wo\n```\n\n### String Padding\n\nWith the [`fill`](/commands/docs/fill.md) command you can add padding to a string. Padding adds characters to string until it's a certain length. For example:\n\n```nu\n'1234' | fill -a right -c '0' -w 10\n# => 0000001234\n'1234' | fill -a left -c '0' -w 10 | str length\n# => 10\n```\n\n### Reversing Strings\n\nThis can be done easily with the [`str reverse`](/commands/docs/str_reverse.md) command.\n\n```nu\n'Nushell' | str reverse\n# => llehsuN\n['Nushell' 'is' 'cool'] | str reverse\n# => ╭───┬─────────╮\n# => │ 0 │ llehsuN │\n# => │ 1 │ si      │\n# => │ 2 │ looc    │\n# => ╰───┴─────────╯\n```\n\n## String Parsing\n\nWith the [`parse`](/commands/docs/parse.md) command you can parse a string into columns. For example:\n\n```nu\n'Nushell 0.80' | parse '{shell} {version}'\n# => ╭───┬─────────┬─────────╮\n# => │ # │  shell  │ version │\n# => ├───┼─────────┼─────────┤\n# => │ 0 │ Nushell │ 0.80    │\n# => ╰───┴─────────┴─────────╯\n'where all data is structured!' | parse --regex '(?P<subject>\\w*\\s?\\w+) is (?P<adjective>\\w+)'\n# => ╭───┬──────────┬────────────╮\n# => │ # │ subject  │ adjective  │\n# => ├───┼──────────┼────────────┤\n# => │ 0 │ all data │ structured │\n# => ╰───┴──────────┴────────────╯\n```\n\nIf a string is known to contain comma-separated, tab-separated or multi-space-separated data, you can use [`from csv`](/commands/docs/from_csv.md), [`from tsv`](/commands/docs/from_tsv.md) or [`from ssv`](/commands/docs/from_ssv.md):\n\n```nu\n\"acronym,long\\nAPL,A Programming Language\" | from csv\n# => ╭───┬─────────┬────────────────────────╮\n# => │ # │ acronym │          long          │\n# => ├───┼─────────┼────────────────────────┤\n# => │ 0 │ APL     │ A Programming Language │\n# => ╰───┴─────────┴────────────────────────╯\n\"name  duration\\nonestop.mid  4:06\" | from ssv\n# => ╭───┬─────────────┬──────────╮\n# => │ # │    name     │ duration │\n# => ├───┼─────────────┼──────────┤\n# => │ 0 │ onestop.mid │ 4:06     │\n# => ╰───┴─────────────┴──────────╯\n\"rank\\tsuit\\nJack\\tSpades\\nAce\\tClubs\" | from tsv\n# => ╭───┬──────┬────────╮\n# => │ # │ rank │  suit  │\n# => ├───┼──────┼────────┤\n# => │ 0 │ Jack │ Spades │\n# => │ 1 │ Ace  │ Clubs  │\n# => ╰───┴──────┴────────╯\n```\n\n## String Comparison\n\nIn addition to the standard `==` and `!=` operators, a few operators exist for specifically comparing strings to one another.\n\nThose familiar with Bash and Perl will recognise the regex comparison operators:\n\n```nu\n'APL' =~ '^\\w{0,3}$'\n# => true\n'FORTRAN' !~ '^\\w{0,3}$'\n# => true\n```\n\nTwo other operators exist for simpler comparisons:\n\n```nu\n'JavaScript' starts-with 'Java'\n# => true\n'OCaml' ends-with 'Caml'\n# => true\n```\n\n## Converting Strings\n\nThere are multiple ways to convert strings to and from other types.\n\n### To string\n\n1. Using [`into string`](/commands/docs/into_string.md). e.g. `123 | into string`\n2. Using string interpolation. e.g. `$'(123)'`\n\n### From string\n\n1. Using [`into <type>`](/commands/docs/into.md). e.g. `'123' | into int`\n\n## Coloring Strings\n\nYou can color strings with the [`ansi`](/commands/docs/ansi.md) command. For example:\n\n```nu\n$'(ansi purple_bold)This text is a bold purple!(ansi reset)'\n```\n\n`ansi purple_bold` makes the text a bold purple\n`ansi reset` resets the coloring to the default.\n\n::: tip\nYou should always end colored strings with `ansi reset`\n:::"

    # Hooks

    Hooks allow you to run a code snippet at some predefined situations.
    They are only available in the interactive mode ([REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)), they do not work if you run Nushell with a script (`nu script.nu`) or command (`nu -c "print foo"`) argument.

    Currently, we support these types of hooks:

    - `pre_prompt` : Triggered before the prompt is drawn
    - `pre_execution` : Triggered before the line input starts executing
    - `env_change` : Triggered when an environment variable changes
    - `display_output` : A block that the output is passed to
    - `command_not_found` : Triggered when a command is not found

    To make it clearer, we can break down Nushell's execution cycle.
    The steps to evaluate one line in the REPL mode are as follows:

    1. Check for `pre_prompt` hooks and run them
    1. Check for `env_change` hooks and run them
    1. Display prompt and wait for user input
    1. After user typed something and pressed "Enter": Check for `pre_execution` hooks and run them
    1. Parse and evaluate user input
    1. If a command is not found: Run the `command_not_found` hook. If it returns a string, show it.
    1. If `display_output` is defined, use it to print command output
    1. Return to 1.

    ## Basic Hooks

    To enable hooks, define them in your [config](configuration.md):

    ```nu
    $env.config.hooks = {
        pre_prompt: [{ print "pre prompt hook" }]
        pre_execution: [{ print "pre exec hook" }]
        env_change: {
            PWD: [{|before, after| print $"changing directory from ($before) to ($after)" }]
        }
    }
    ```

    Try putting the above into your config, running Nushell and moving around your filesystem.
    When you change a directory, the `PWD` environment variable changes and the change triggers the hook with the previous and the current values stored in `before` and `after` variables, respectively.

    Instead of defining just a single hook per trigger, it is possible to define a **list of hooks** which will run in sequence:

    ```nu
    $env.config.hooks = {
        pre_prompt: [
            { print "pre prompt hook" }
            { print "pre prompt hook2" }
        ]
        pre_execution: [
            { print "pre exec hook" }
            { print "pre exec hook2" }
        ]
        env_change: {
            PWD: [
                {|before, after| print $"changing directory from ($before) to ($after)" }
                {|before, after| print $"changing directory from ($before) to ($after) 2" }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

    Instead of replacing all hooks, you can append a new hook to existing configuration:

    ```nu
    $env.config.hooks.pre_execution = $env.config.hooks.pre_execution | append { print "pre exec hook3" }
    ```

    ## Changing Environment

    One feature of the hooks is that they preserve the environment.
    Environment variables defined inside the hook **block** will be preserved in a similar way as [`def --env`](environment.md#defining-environment-from-custom-commands).
    You can test it with the following example:

    ```nu
    $env.config = ($env.config | upsert hooks {
        pre_prompt: { $env.SPAM = "eggs" }
    })

    $env.SPAM
    # => eggs
    ```

    The hook blocks otherwise follow the general scoping rules, i.e., commands, aliases, etc. defined within the block will be thrown away once the block ends.

    ## `pre_execution` Hooks

    `pre_execution` hooks can inspect the to-be-executed command through the [`commandline` command](/commands/docs/commandline.md).

    For example, to print the command being executed:

    ```nu
    $env.config = (
        $env.config
        | upsert hooks.pre_execution [ {||
            $env.repl_commandline = (commandline)
            print $"Command: ($env.repl_commandline)"
        } ]
    )

    print (1 + 3)
    # => Command: print (1 + 3)
    # => 4
    ```

    ## Conditional Hooks

    One thing you might be tempted to do is to activate an environment whenever you enter a directory:

    ```nu
    $env.config = ($env.config | upsert hooks {
        env_change: {
            PWD: [
                {|before, after|
                    if $after == /some/path/to/directory {
                        load-env { SPAM: eggs }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    })
    ```

    This won't work because the environment will be active only within the [`if`](/commands/docs/if.md) block.
    In this case, you could easily rewrite it as `load-env (if $after == ... { ... } else { {} })` but this pattern is fairly common and later we'll see that not all cases can be rewritten like this.

    To deal with the above problem, we introduce another way to define a hook - **a record**:

    ```nu
    $env.config = ($env.config | upsert hooks {
        env_change: {
            PWD: [
                {
                    condition: {|before, after| $after == /some/path/to/directory }
                    code: {|before, after| load-env { SPAM: eggs } }
                }
            ]
        }
    })
    ```

    When the hook triggers, it evaluates the `condition` block.
    If it returns `true`, the `code` block will be evaluated.
    If it returns `false`, nothing will happen.
    If it returns something else, an error will be thrown.
    The `condition` field can also be omitted altogether in which case the hook will always evaluate.

    The `pre_prompt` and `pre_execution` hook types also support the conditional hooks but they don't accept the `before` and `after` parameters.

    ## Hooks as Strings

    So far a hook was defined as a block that preserves only the environment, but nothing else.
    To be able to define commands or aliases, it is possible to define the `code` field as **a string**.
    You can think of it as if you typed the string into the REPL and hit Enter.
    So, the hook from the previous section can be also written as

    ```nu
    $env.config = ($env.config | upsert hooks {
        pre_prompt: '$env.SPAM = "eggs"'
    })

    $env.SPAM
    # => eggs
    ```

    This feature can be used, for example, to conditionally bring in definitions based on the current directory:

    ```nu
    $env.config = ($env.config | upsert hooks {
        env_change: {
            PWD: [
                {
                    condition: {|_, after| $after == /some/path/to/directory }
                    code: 'def foo [] { print "foo" }'
                }
                {
                    condition: {|before, _| $before == /some/path/to/directory }
                    code: 'hide foo'
                }
            ]
        }
    })
    ```

    When defining a hook as a string, the `$before` and `$after` variables are set to the previous and current environment variable value, respectively, similarly to the previous examples:

    ```nu
    $env.config = ($env.config | upsert hooks {
        env_change: {
            PWD: {
                code: 'print $"changing directory from ($before) to ($after)"'
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Examples

    ### Adding a Single Hook to Existing Config

    An example for PWD env change hook:

    ```nu
    $env.config = ($env.config | upsert hooks.env_change.PWD {|config|
        let val = ($config | get -i hooks.env_change.PWD)

        if $val == null {
            $val | append {|before, after| print $"changing directory from ($before) to ($after)" }
        } else {
            [
                {|before, after| print $"changing directory from ($before) to ($after)" }
            ]
        }
    })
    ```

    ### Automatically Activating an Environment when Entering a Directory

    This one looks for `test-env.nu` in a directory

    ```nu
    $env.config = ($env.config | upsert hooks.env_change.PWD {
        [
            {
                condition: {|_, after|
                    ($after == '/path/to/target/dir'
                        and ($after | path join test-env.nu | path exists))
                }
                code: "overlay use test-env.nu"
            }
            {
                condition: {|before, after|
                    ('/path/to/target/dir' not-in $after
                        and '/path/to/target/dir' in ($before | default "")
                        and 'test-env' in (overlay list))
                }
                code: "overlay hide test-env --keep-env [ PWD ]"
            }
        ]
    })
    ```

    ### Filtering or Diverting Command Output

    You can use the `display_output` hook to redirect the output of commands.
    You should define a block that works on all value types.
    The output of external commands is not filtered through `display_output`.

    This hook can display the output in a separate window,
    perhaps as rich HTML text. Here is the basic idea of how to do that:

    ```nu
    $env.config = ($env.config | upsert hooks {
        display_output: { to html --partial --no-color | save --raw /tmp/nu-output.html }
    })
    ```

    You can view the result by opening `file:///tmp/nu-output.html` in
    a web browser.
    Of course this isn't very convenient unless you use
    a browser that automatically reloads when the file changes.
    Instead of the [`save`](/commands/docs/save.md) command, you would normally customize this
    to send the HTML output to a desired window.

    ### Changing how Output is Displayed

    You can change to default behavior of how output is displayed by using the `display_output` hook.
    Here is an example that changes the default display behavior to show a table 1 layer deep if the terminal is wide enough, or collapse otherwise:

    ```nu
    $env.config = ($env.config | upsert hooks {
        display_output: {if (term size).columns >= 100 { table -ed 1 } else { table }}
    })
    ```

    ### `command_not_found` Hook in _Arch Linux_

    The following hook uses the `pkgfile` command, to find which packages commands belong to in _Arch Linux_.

    ```nu
    $env.config = {
        ...other config...

        hooks: {
            ...other hooks...

            command_not_found: {
                |cmd_name| (
                    try {
                        let pkgs = (pkgfile --binaries --verbose $cmd_name)
                        if ($pkgs | is-empty) {
                            return null
                        }
                        (
                            $"(ansi $env.config.color_config.shape_external)($cmd_name)(ansi reset) " +
                            $"may be found in the following packages:\n($pkgs)"
                        )
                    }
                )
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ### `command_not_found` Hook in _NixOS_

    NixOS comes with the command `command-not-found`. We only need to plug it in the nushell hook:

    ```nu
    $env.config.hooks.command_not_found = {
      |command_name|
      print (command-not-found $command_name | str trim)
    }
    ```


    ### `command_not_found` Hook in _Windows_

    The following hook uses the `ftype` command, to find program paths in _Windows_ that might be relevant to the user for `alias`-ing.

    ```nu
    $env.config = {
        ...other config...

        hooks: {
            ...other hooks...

            command_not_found: {
                |cmd_name| (
                    try {
                        let attrs = (
                            ftype | find $cmd_name | to text | lines | reduce -f [] { |line, acc|
                                $line | parse "{type}={path}" | append $acc
                            } | group-by path | transpose key value | each { |row|
                                { path: $row.key, types: ($row.value | get type | str join ", ") }
                            }
                        )
                        let len = ($attrs | length)

                        if $len == 0 {
                            return null
                        } else {
                            return ($attrs | table --collapse)
                        }
                    }

    # Thinking in Nu

    Nushell is different! It's common (and expected!) for new users to have some existing "habits" or mental models coming from other shells or languages.

    The most common questions from new users typically fall into one of the following topics:

    [[toc]]

    ## Nushell isn't Bash

    ### It can sometimes look like Bash

    Nushell is both a programming language and a shell. Because of this, it has its own way of working with files, directories, websites, and more. You'll find that some features in Nushell work similar to those you're familiar with in other shells. For instance, pipelines work by combining two (or more) commands together, just like in other shells.

    For example, the following commandline works the same in both Bash and Nushell on Unix/Linux platforms:

    ```nu
    curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/nushell/nushell/contributors | jq -c '.[] | {login,contributions}'
    # => returns contributors to Nushell, ordered by number of contributions
    ```

    Nushell has many other similarities with Bash (and other shells) and many commands in common.

    ::: tip
    Bash is primarily a command interpreter which runs external commands. Nushell provides many of these as cross-platform, built-in commands.

    While the above commandline works in both shells, in Nushell there's just no need to use the `curl` and `jq` commands. Instead, Nushell has a built-in [`http get` command](/commands/docs/http_get.md) and handles JSON data natively. For example:

    ```nu
    http get https://api.github.com/repos/nushell/nushell/contributors | select login contributions
    ```

    :::

    ::: warning Thinking in Nushell
    Nushell borrows concepts from many shells and languages. You'll likely find many of Nushell's features familiar.
    :::

    ### But it's not Bash

    Because of this, however, it's sometimes easy to forget that some Bash (and POSIX in general) style constructs just won't work in Nushell. For instance, in Bash, it would be normal to write:

    ```sh
    # Redirect using >
    echo "hello" > output.txt
    # But compare (greater-than) using the test command
    test 4 -gt 7
    echo $?
    # => 1
    ```

    In Nushell, however, the `>` is used as the greater-than operator for comparisons. This is more in line with modern programming expectations.

    ```nu
    4 > 10
    # => false
    ```

    Since `>` is an operator, redirection to a file in Nushell is handled through a pipeline command that is dedicated to saving content - [`save`](/commands/docs/save.md):

    ```nu
    "hello" | save output.txt
    ```

    ::: warning Thinking in Nushell
    We've put together a list of common Bash'isms and how to accomplish those tasks in Nushell in the [Coming from Bash](./coming_from_bash.md) Chapter.
    :::

    ## Implicit Return

    Users coming from other shells will likely be very familiar with the `echo` command. Nushell's
    [`echo`](/commands/docs/echo.md) might appear the same at first, but it is _very_ different.

    First, notice how the following output _looks_ the same in both Bash and Nushell (and even PowerShell and Fish):

    ```nu
    echo "Hello, World"
    # => Hello, World
    ```

    But while the other shells are sending `Hello, World` straight to _standard output_, Nushell's `echo` is
    simply _returning a value_. Nushell then _renders_ the return value of a command, or more technically, an _expression_.

    More importantly, Nushell _implicitly returns_ the value of an expression. This is similar to PowerShell or Rust in many respects.

    ::: tip
    An expression can be more than just a pipeline. Even custom commands (similar to functions in many languages, but we'll cover them more in depth in a [later chapter](./custom_commands.md)) automatically, implicitly _return_ the last value. There's no need for an `echo` or even a [`return` command](/commands/docs/return.md) to return a value - It just _happens_.
    :::

    In other words, the string _"Hello, World"_ and the output value from `echo "Hello, World"` are equivalent:

    ```nu
    "Hello, World" == (echo "Hello, World")
    # => true
    ```

    Here's another example with a custom command definition:

    ```nu
    def latest-file [] {
        ls | sort-by modified | last
    }
    ```

    The _output_ of that pipeline (its _"value"_) becomes the _return value_ of the `latest-file` custom command.

    ::: warning Thinking in Nushell
    Most anywhere you might write `echo <something>`, in Nushell, you can just write `<something>` instead.
    :::

    ## Single Return Value per Expression

    It's important to understand that an expression can only return a single value. If there are multiple subexpressions inside an expression, only the **_last_** value is returned.

    A common mistake is to write a custom command definition like this:

    ```nu:line-numbers
    def latest-file [] {
        echo "Returning the last file"
        ls | sort-by modified | last
    }

    latest-file
    ```

    New users might expect:

    - Line 2 to output _"Returning the last file"_
    - Line 3 to return/output the file

    However, remember that `echo` **_returns a value_**. Since only the last value is returned, the Line 2 _value_ is discarded. Only the file will be returned by line 3.

    To make sure the first line is _displayed_, use the [`print` command](/commands/docs/print.md):

    ```nu
    def latest-file [] {
        print "Returning last file"
        ls | sort-by modified | last
    }
    ```

    Also compare:

    ```nu
    40; 50; 60
    ```

    ::: tip
    A semicolon is the same as a newline in a Nushell expression. The above is the same as a file or multi-line command:

    ```nu
    40
    50
    60
    ```

    or

    ```nu
    echo 40
    echo 50
    echo 60
    ```

    See Also: [Multi-line Editing](./line_editor.md#multi-line-editing)
    :::

    In all of the above:

    - The first value is evaluated as the integer 40 but is not returned
    - The second value is evaluated as the integer 50 but is not returned
    - The third value is evaluated as the integer 60, and since it is the last
      value, it is is returned and displayed (rendered).

    ::: warning Thinking in Nushell
    When debugging unexpected results, be on the lookout for:

    - Subexpressions (e.g., commands or pipelines) that ...
    - ... output a (non-`null`) value ...
    - ... where that value isn't returned from the parent expression.

    These can be likely sources of issues in your code.
    :::

    ## Every Command Returns a Value

    Some languages have the concept of "statements" which don't return values. Nushell does not.

    In Nushell, **_every command returns a value_**, even if that value is `null` (the `nothing` type). Consider the following multiline expression:

    ```nu:line-numbers
    let p = 7
    print $p
    $p * 6
    ```

    1. Line 1: The integer 7 is assigned to `$p`, but the return value of the
       [`let` command](/commands/docs/let.md) itself is `null`. However, because it is not the last
       value in the expression, it is not displayed.
    2. Line 2: The return value of the `print` command itself is `null`, but the `print` command
       forces its argument (`$p`, which is 7) to be _displayed_. As with Line 1, the `null` return value
       is discarded since this isn't the last value in the expression.
    3. Line 3: Evaluates to the integer value 42. As the last value in the expression, this is the return
       result, and is also displayed (rendered).

    ::: warning Thinking in Nushell
    Becoming familiar with the output types of common commands will help you understand how
    to combine simple commands together to achieve complex results.

    `help <command>` will show the signature, including the output type(s), for each command in Nushell.
    :::

    ## Think of Nushell as a Compiled Language

    In Nushell, there are exactly two, separate, high-level stages when running code:

    1. _Stage 1 (Parser):_ Parse the **_entire_** source code
    2. _Stage 2 (Engine):_ Evaluate the **_entire_** source code

    It can be useful to think of Nushell's parsing stage as _compilation_ in [static](./how_nushell_code_gets_run.md#dynamic-vs-static-languages) languages like Rust or C++. By this, we mean that all of the code that will be evaluated in Stage 2 must be **_known and available_** during the parsing stage.

    ::: important
    However, this also means that Nushell cannot currently support an `eval` construct as with _dynamic_ languages such as Bash or Python.
    :::

    ### Features Built on Static Parsing

    On the other hand, the **_static_** results of Parsing are key to many features of Nushell its REPL, such as:

    - Accurate and expressive error messages
    - Semantic analysis for earlier and robust detection of error conditions
    - IDE integration
    - The type system
    - The module system
    - Completions
    - Custom command argument parsing
    - Syntax highlighting
    - Real-time error highlighting
    - Profiling and debugging commands
    - (Future) Formatting
    - (Future) Saving IR (Intermediate Representation) "compiled" results for faster execution

    ### Limitations

    The static nature of Nushell often leads to confusion for users coming to Nushell from languages where an `eval` is available.

    Consider a simple two-line file:

    ```text
    <line1 code>
    <line2 code>
    ```

    1. Parsing:
       1. Line 1 is parsed
       2. Line 2 is parsed
    2. If parsing was successful, then Evaluation:
       1. Line 1 is evaluated
       2. Line 2 is evaluated

    This helps demonstrate why the following examples cannot run as a single expression (e.g., a script) in Nushell:

    ::: note
    The following examples use the [`source` command](/commands/docs/source.md), but similar conclusions apply to other commands that parse Nushell source code, such as [`use`](/commands/docs/use.md), [`overlay use`](/commands/docs/overlay_use.md), [`hide`](/commands/docs/hide.md) or [`source-env`](/commands/docs/source-env.md).

    :::

    #### Example: Dynamically Generating Source

    Consider this scenario:

    ```nu
    "print Hello" | save output.nu
    source output.nu
    # => Error: nu::parser::sourced_file_not_found
    # =>
    # =>   × File not found
    # =>    ╭─[entry #5:2:8]
    # =>  1 │ "print Hello" | save output.nu
    # =>  2 │ source output.nu
    # =>    ·        ────┬────
    # =>    ·            ╰── File not found: output.nu
    # =>    ╰────
    # =>   help: sourced files need to be available before your script is run
    ```

    This is problematic because:

    1. Line 1 is parsed but not evaluated. In other words, `output.nu` is not created during the parsing stage, but only during evaluation.
    2. Line 2 is parsed. Because `source` is a parser-keyword, resolution of the sourced file is attempted during Parsing (Stage 1). But `output.nu` doesn't even exist yet! If it _does_ exist, then it's probably not even the correct file! This results in the error.

    ::: note
    Typing these as two _separate_ lines in the **_REPL_** will work since the first line will be parsed and evaluated, then the second line will be parsed and evaluated.

    The limitation only occurs when both are parsed _together_ as a single expression, which could be part of a script, block, closure, or other expression.

    See the [REPL](./how_nushell_code_gets_run.md#the-nushell-repl) section in _"How Nushell Code Gets Run"_ for more explanation.
    :::

    #### Example: Dynamically Creating a Filename to be Sourced

    Another common scenario when coming from another shell might be attempting to dynamically create a filename that will be sourced:

    ```nu
    let my_path = "~/nushell-files"
    source $"($my_path)/common.nu"
    # => Error:
    # =>   × Error: nu::shell::not_a_constant
    # =>   │
    # =>   │   × Not a constant.
    # =>   │    ╭─[entry #6:2:11]
    # =>   │  1 │ let my_path = "~/nushell-files"
    # =>   │  2 │ source $"($my_path)/common.nu"
    # =>   │    ·           ────┬───
    # =>   │    ·               ╰── Value is not a parse-time constant
    # =>   │    ╰────
    # =>   │   help: Only a subset of expressions are allowed constants during parsing. Try using the 'const' command or typing the value literally.
    # =>   │
    # =>    ╭─[entry #6:2:8]
    # =>  1 │ let my_path = "~/nushell-files"
    # =>  2 │ source $"($my_path)/common.nu"
    # =>    ·        ───────────┬───────────
    # =>    ·                   ╰── Encountered error during parse-time evaluation
    # =>    ╰────
    ```

    Because the `let` assignment is not resolved until evaluation, the parser-keyword `source` will fail during parsing if passed a variable.

    ::: details Comparing Rust and C++
    Imagine that the code above was written in a typical compiled language such as C++:

    ```cpp
    #include <string>

    std::string my_path("foo");
    #include <my_path + "/common.h">
    ```

    or Rust

    ```rust
    let my_path = "foo";
    use format!("{}::common", my_path);
    ```

    If you've ever written a simple program in any of these languages, you can see these examples aren't valid in those languages. Like Nushell, compiled languages require that all of the source code files are ready and available to the compiler beforehand.

    :::

    ::: tip See Also
    As noted in the error message, however, this can work if `my_path` can be defined as a [constant](/book/variables#constant-variables) since constants can be (and are) resolved during parsing.

    ```nu
    const my_path = "~/nushell-files"
    source $"($my_path)/common.nu"
    ```

    See [Parse-time Constant Evaluation](./how_nushell_code_gets_run.md#parse-time-constant-evaluation) for more details.
    :::

    #### Example: Change to a different directory (`cd`) and `source` a file

    Here's one more — Change to a different directory and then attempt to `source` a file in that directory.

    ```nu:line-numbers
    if ('spam/foo.nu' | path exists) {
        cd spam
        source-env foo.nu
    }
    ```

    Based on what we've covered about Nushell's Parse/Eval stages, see if you can spot the problem with that example.

    ::: details Solution

    In line 3, during Parsing, the `source-env` attempts to parse `foo.nu`. However, `cd` doesn't occur until Evaluation. This results in a parse-time error, since the file is not found in the _current_ directory.

    To resolve this, of course, simply use the full-path to the file to be sourced.

    ```nu
        source-env spam/foo.nu
    ```

    :::

    ### Summary

    ::: important
    For a more in-depth explanation of this section, see [How Nushell Code Gets Run](how_nushell_code_gets_run.md).
    :::

    ::: warning Thinking in Nushell
    Nushell is designed to use a single Parsing stage for each expression or file. This Parsing stage occurs before and is separate from Evaluation. While this enables many of Nushell's features, it also means that users need to understand the limitations it creates.
    :::

    ## Variables are Immutable by Default

    Another common surprise when coming from other languages is that Nushell variables are immutable by default. While Nushell has optional mutable variables, many of Nushell's commands are based on a functional-style of programming which requires immutability.

    Immutable variables are also key to Nushell's [`par-each` command](/commands/docs/par-each.md), which allows you to operate on multiple values in parallel using threads.

    See [Immutable Variables](variables.html#immutable-variables) and [Choosing between mutable and immutable variables](variables.html#choosing-between-mutable-and-immutable-variables) for more information.

    ::: warning Thinking in Nushell
    If you're used to relying on mutable variables, it may take some time to relearn how to code in a more functional style. Nushell has many functional features and commands that operate on and with immutable variables. Learning them will help you write code in a more Nushell-idiomatic style.

    A nice bonus is the performance increase you can realize by running parts of your code in parallel with `par-each`.
    :::

    ## Nushell's Environment is Scoped

    Nushell takes multiple design cues from compiled languages. One such cue is that languages should avoid global mutable state. Shells have commonly used global mutation to update the environment, but Nushell attempts to steer clear of this approach.

    In Nushell, blocks control their own environment. Changes to the environment are scoped to the block where they occur.

    In practice, this lets you write (as just one example) more concise code for working with subdirectories. Here's an example that builds each sub-project in the current directory:

    ```nu
    ls | each { |row|
      cd $row.name
      make
    }
    ```

    The [`cd`](/commands/docs/cd.md) command changes the `PWD` environment variables, but this variable change does not survive past the end of the block. This allows each iteration to start from the current directory and then enter the next subdirectory.

    Having a scoped environment makes commands more predictable, easier to read, and when the time comes, easier to debug. It's also another feature that is key to the `par-each` command we discussed above.

    Nushell also provides helper commands like [`load-env`](/commands/docs/load-env.md) as a convenient way of loading multiple updates to the environment at once.

    ::: tip See Also
    [Environment - Scoping](./environment.md#scoping)
    :::

    ::: note
    [`def --env`](/commands/docs/def.md) is an exception to this rule. It allows you to create a command that changes the parent's environment.
    :::

    ::: warning Thinking in Nushell
    Use scoped-environment to write more concise scripts and prevent unnecessary or unwanted global environment mutation.

    2. Download and install a [nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
    3. Generate the .oh-my-posh.nu file. By default it will be generated to your home directory. You can use `--config` to specify a theme, other wise, oh-my-posh comes with a default theme.
    4. Initialize oh-my-posh prompt by adding in ~/.config/nushell/config.nu(or the path output by `$nu.config-path`) to source ~/.oh-my-posh.nu.

    ```nu
    # Generate the .oh-my-posh.nu file
    oh-my-posh init nu --config ~/.poshthemes/M365Princess.omp.json

    # Initialize oh-my-posh.nu at shell startup by adding this line in your config.nu file
    source ~/.oh-my-posh.nu
    ```

    For MacOS users:

    1. You can install oh-my-posh using `brew`, just following the [guide here](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/macos)
    2. Download and install a [nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
    3. Set the PROMPT_COMMAND in the file output by `$nu.config-path`, here is a code snippet:

    ```nu
    let posh_dir = (brew --prefix oh-my-posh | str trim)
    let posh_theme = $'($posh_dir)/share/oh-my-posh/themes/'
    # Change the theme names to: zash/space/robbyrussel/powerline/powerlevel10k_lean/
    # material/half-life/lambda Or double lines theme: amro/pure/spaceship, etc.
    # For more [Themes demo](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes)
    $env.PROMPT_COMMAND = { || oh-my-posh prompt print primary --config $'($posh_theme)/zash.omp.json' }
    # Optional
    $env.PROMPT_INDICATOR = $"(ansi y)$> (ansi reset)"
    ```

    ## Starship

    [site](https://starship.rs/)

    [repo](https://github.com/starship/starship)

    1. Follow the links above and install Starship.
    2. Install nerdfonts depending on your preferences.
    3. Use the config example below. Make sure to set the `STARSHIP_SHELL` environment variable.

    ::: tip
    An alternate way to enable Starship is described in the [Starship Quick Install](https://starship.rs/#nushell) instructions.

    The link above is the official integration of Starship and Nushell and is the simplest way to get
    Starship running without doing anything manual:

    - Starship will create its own configuration / environment setup script
    - you simply have to create it in `env.nu` and `use` it in `config.nu`
      :::

    Here's an example config section for Starship:

    ```nu
    $env.STARSHIP_SHELL = "nu"

    def create_left_prompt [] {
        starship prompt --cmd-duration $env.CMD_DURATION_MS $'--status=($env.LAST_EXIT_CODE)'
    }

    # Use nushell functions to define your right and left prompt
    $env.PROMPT_COMMAND = { || create_left_prompt }
    $env.PROMPT_COMMAND_RIGHT = ""

    # The prompt indicators are environmental variables that represent
    # the state of the prompt
    $env.PROMPT_INDICATOR = ""
    $env.PROMPT_INDICATOR_VI_INSERT = ": "
    $env.PROMPT_INDICATOR_VI_NORMAL = "〉"
    $env.PROMPT_MULTILINE_INDICATOR = "::: "
    ```

    Now restart Nu.

    ```
    nushell on 📙 main is 📦 v0.60.0 via 🦀 v1.59.0
    ❯
    ```

- prompt: |-
    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `loading_data page of the documentation provided by Nushell`.



    Documentation text:

    # Loading Data

    Earlier, we saw how you can use commands like [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md), [`ps`](/commands/docs/ps.md), [`date`](/commands/docs/date.md), and [`sys`](/commands/docs/sys.md) to load information about your files, processes, time of day, and the system itself. Each command gives us a table of information that we can explore. There are other ways we can load in a table of data to work with.

    ## Opening files

    One of Nu's most powerful assets in working with data is the [`open`](/commands/docs/open.md) command. It is a multi-tool that can work with a number of different data formats. To see what this means, let's try opening a json file:

    @[code](@snippets/loading_data/vscode.sh)

    In a similar way to [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md), opening a file type that Nu understands will give us back something that is more than just text (or a stream of bytes). Here we open a "package.json" file from a JavaScript project. Nu can recognize the JSON text and parse it to a table of data.

    If we wanted to check the version of the project we were looking at, we can use the [`get`](/commands/docs/get.md) command.

    ```nu
    open editors/vscode/package.json | get version
    # => 1.0.0
    ```

    Nu currently supports the following formats for loading data directly into tables:

    - csv
    - eml
    - ics
    - ini
    - json
    - [nuon](#nuon)
    - ods
    - [SQLite databases](#sqlite)
    - ssv
    - toml
    - tsv
    - url
    - vcf
    - xlsx / xls
    - xml
    - yaml / yml

    ::: tip Did you know?
    Under the hood `open` will look for a `from ...` subcommand in your scope which matches the extension of your file.
    You can thus simply extend the set of supported file types of `open` by creating your own `from ...` subcommand.
    :::

    But what happens if you load a text file that isn't one of these? Let's try it:

    ```nu
    open README.md
    ```

    We're shown the contents of the file.

    Below the surface, what Nu sees in these text files is one large string. Next, we'll talk about how to work with these strings to get the data we need out of them.

    ## NUON

    Nushell Object Notation (NUON) aims to be for Nushell what JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is for JavaScript.
    That is, NUON code is a valid Nushell code that describes some data structure.
    For example, this is a valid NUON (example from the [default configuration file](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-utils/src/default_files/default_config.nu)):

    ```nu
    {
      menus: [
        # Configuration for default nushell menus
        # Note the lack of source parameter
        {
          name: completion_menu
          only_buffer_difference: false
          marker: "| "
          type: {
              layout: columnar
              columns: 4
              col_width: 20   # Optional value. If missing all the screen width is used to calculate column width
              col_padding: 2
          }
          style: {
              text: green
              selected_text: green_reverse
              description_text: yellow
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    You might notice it is quite similar to JSON, and you're right.
    **NUON is a superset of JSON!**
    That is, any JSON code is a valid NUON code, therefore a valid Nushell code.
    Compared to JSON, NUON is more "human-friendly".
    For example, comments are allowed and commas are not required.

    One limitation of NUON currently is that it cannot represent all of the Nushell [data types](types_of_data.md).
    Most notably, NUON does not allow the serialization of blocks.

    ## Handling Strings

    An important part of working with data coming from outside Nu is that it's not always in a format that Nu understands. Often this data is given to us as a string.

    Let's imagine that we're given this data file:

    ```nu
    open people.txt
    # => Octavia | Butler | Writer
    # => Bob | Ross | Painter
    # => Antonio | Vivaldi | Composer
    ```

    Each bit of data we want is separated by the pipe ('|') symbol, and each person is on a separate line. Nu doesn't have a pipe-delimited file format by default, so we'll have to parse this ourselves.

    The first thing we want to do when bringing in the file is to work with it a line at a time:

    ```nu
    open people.txt | lines
    # => ───┬──────────────────────────────
    # =>  0 │ Octavia | Butler | Writer
    # =>  1 │ Bob | Ross | Painter
    # =>  2 │ Antonio | Vivaldi | Composer
    # => ───┴──────────────────────────────
    ```

    We can see that we're working with the lines because we're back into a list. Our next step is to see if we can split up the rows into something a little more useful. For that, we'll use the [`split`](/commands/docs/split.md) command. [`split`](/commands/docs/split.md), as the name implies, gives us a way to split a delimited string. We will use [`split`](/commands/docs/split.md)'s `column` subcommand to split the contents across multiple columns. We tell it what the delimiter is, and it does the rest:

    ```nu
    open people.txt | lines | split column "|"
    # => ───┬──────────┬───────────┬───────────
    # =>  # │ column1  │ column2   │ column3
    # => ───┼──────────┼───────────┼───────────
    # =>  0 │ Octavia  │  Butler   │  Writer
    # =>  1 │ Bob      │  Ross     │  Painter
    # =>  2 │ Antonio  │  Vivaldi  │  Composer
    # => ───┴──────────┴───────────┴───────────
    ```

    That _almost_ looks correct. It looks like there's an extra space there. Let's [`trim`](/commands/docs/str_trim.md) that extra space:

    ```nu
    open people.txt | lines | split column "|" | str trim
    # => ───┬─────────┬─────────┬──────────
    # =>  # │ column1 │ column2 │ column3
    # => ───┼─────────┼─────────┼──────────
    # =>  0 │ Octavia │ Butler  │ Writer
    # =>  1 │ Bob     │ Ross    │ Painter
    # =>  2 │ Antonio │ Vivaldi │ Composer
    # => ───┴─────────┴─────────┴──────────
    ```

    Not bad. The [`split`](/commands/docs/split.md) command gives us data we can use. It also goes ahead and gives us default column names:

    ```nu
    open people.txt | lines | split column "|" | str trim | get column1
    # => ───┬─────────
    # =>  0 │ Octavia
    # =>  1 │ Bob
    # =>  2 │ Antonio
    # => ───┴─────────
    ```

    We can also name our columns instead of using the default names:

    ```nu
    open people.txt | lines | split column "|" first_name last_name job | str trim
    # => ───┬────────────┬───────────┬──────────
    # =>  # │ first_name │ last_name │ job
    # => ───┼────────────┼───────────┼──────────
    # =>  0 │ Octavia    │ Butler    │ Writer
    # =>  1 │ Bob        │ Ross      │ Painter
    # =>  2 │ Antonio    │ Vivaldi   │ Composer
    # => ───┴────────────┴───────────┴──────────
    ```

    Now that our data is in a table, we can use all the commands we've used on tables before:

    ```nu

    There are other commands you can use to work with strings:

    - [`str`](/commands/docs/str.md)
    - [`lines`](/commands/docs/lines.md)

    There is also a set of helper commands we can call if we know the data has a structure that Nu should be able to understand. For example, let's open a Rust lock file:

    ```nu
    open Cargo.lock
    # => # This file is automatically @generated by Cargo.
    # => # It is not intended for manual editing.
    # => [[package]]
    # => name = "adhoc_derive"
    # => version = "0.1.2"
    ```

    The "Cargo.lock" file is actually a .toml file, but the file extension isn't .toml. That's okay, we can use the [`from`](/commands/docs/from.md) command using the `toml` subcommand:

    @[code](@snippets/loading_data/cargo-toml.sh)

    The [`from`](/commands/docs/from.md) command can be used for each of the structured data text formats that Nu can open and understand by passing it the supported format as a subcommand.

    ## Opening in raw mode

    While it's helpful to be able to open a file and immediately work with a table of its data, this is not always what you want to do. To get to the underlying text, the [`open`](/commands/docs/open.md) command can take an optional `--raw` flag:

    ```nu
    open Cargo.toml --raw
    # => [package]                                                                                        name = "nu"
    # => version = "0.1.3"
    # => authors = ["Yehuda Katz <wycats@gmail.com>", "Sophia Turner <547158+sophiajt@users.noreply.github.com>"]
    # => description = "A shell for the GitHub era"
    # => license = "MIT"
    ```

    ## SQLite

    SQLite databases are automatically detected by [`open`](/commands/docs/open.md), no matter what their file extension is. You can open a whole database:

    ```nu
    open foo.db
    ```

    Or [`get`](/commands/docs/get.md) a specific table:

    ```nu
    open foo.db | get some_table
    ```

    Or run any SQL query you like:

    ```nu
    open foo.db | query db "select * from some_table"
    ```

    (Note: some older versions of Nu use `into db | query` instead of `query db` )

    ## Fetching URLs

    In addition to loading files from your filesystem, you can also load URLs by using the [`http get`](/commands/docs/http.md) command. This will fetch the contents of the URL from the internet and return it:

    # Running System (External) Commands

    Nu provides a set of commands that you can use across different operating systems ("internal" commands) and having this consistency is helpful when creating cross-platform code. Sometimes, though, you want to run an external command that has the same name as an internal Nu command. To run the external [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) or [`date`](/commands/docs/date.md) command, for example, preface it with the caret (^) sigil. Prefacing with the caret calls the external command found in the user's `PATH` (e.g. `/bin/ls`) instead of Nu's internal [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) command).

    Nu internal command:

    ```nu
    ls
    ```

    External command (typically `/usr/bin/ls`):

    ```nu
    ^ls
    ```

    ::: note
    On Windows, `ls` is a PowerShell _alias_ by default, so `^ls` will not find a matching system _command_.
    :::

    ## Additional Windows Notes

    When running an external command on Windows,
    Nushell forwards some `CMD.EXE` internal commands to cmd instead of attempting to run external commands.
    [Coming from CMD.EXE](coming_from_cmd.md) contains a list of these commands and describes the behavior in more detail.

    # Nu Fundamentals

    This chapter explains some of the fundamentals of the Nushell programming language.
    After going through it, you should have an idea how to write simple Nushell programs.

    Nushell has a rich type system.
    You will find typical data types such as strings or integers and less typical data types, such as cell paths.
    Furthermore, one of the defining features of Nushell is the notion of _structured data_ which means that you can organize types into collections: lists, records, or tables.
    Contrary to the traditional Unix approach where commands communicate via plain text, Nushell commands communicate via these data types.
    All of the above is explained in [Types of Data](types_of_data.md).

    [Loading Data](loading_data.md) explains how to read common data formats, such as JSON, into _structured data_. This includes our own "NUON" data format.

    Just like Unix shells, Nushell commands can be composed into [pipelines](pipelines.md) to pass and modify a stream of data.

    Some data types have interesting features that deserve their own sections: [strings](working_with_strings.md), [lists](working_with_lists.md), and [tables](working_with_tables.md).
    Apart from explaining the features, these sections also show how to do some common operations, such as composing strings or updating values in a list.

    Finally, [Command Reference](/commands/) lists all the built-in commands with brief descriptions.
    Note that you can also access this info from within Nushell using the [`help`](/commands/docs/help.md) command.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `control_flow page of the documentation provided by Nushell`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# Control Flow\n\nNushell provides several commands that help determine how different groups of code are executed. In programming languages this functionality is often referred to as _control flow_.\n\n::: tip\nOne thing to note is that all of the commands discussed on this page use [blocks](/book/types_of_data.html#blocks). This means you can mutate [environmental variables](/book/environment.html) and other [mutable variables](/book/variables.html#mutable-variables) in them.\n:::\n\n## Already covered\n\nBelow we cover some commands related to control flow, but before we get to them, it's worthwhile to note there are several pieces of functionality and concepts that have already been covered in other sections that are also related to control flow or that can be used in the same situations. These include:\n\n- Pipes on the [pipelines](/book/pipelines.html) page.\n- Closures on the [types of data](/book/types_of_data.html) page.\n- Iteration commands on the [working with lists](/book/working_with_lists.html) page. Such as:\n  - [`each`](/commands/docs/each.html)\n  - [`where`](/commands/docs/where.html)\n  - [`reduce`](/commands/docs/reduce.html)\n\n## Choice (Conditionals)\n\nThe following commands execute code based on some given condition.\n\n::: tip\nThe choice/conditional commands are expressions so they return values, unlike the other commands on this page. This means the following works.\n\n```nu\n'foo' | if $in == 'foo' { 1 } else { 0 } | $in + 2\n# => 3\n```\n\n:::\n\n### `if`\n\n[`if`](/commands/docs/if.html) evaluates branching [blocks](/book/types_of_data.html#blocks) of code based on the results of one or more conditions similar to the \"if\" functionality in other programming languages. For example:\n\n```nu\nif $x > 0 { 'positive' }\n```\n\nReturns `'positive`' when the condition is `true` (`$x` is greater than zero) and `null` when the condition is `false` (`$x` is less than or equal to zero).\n\nWe can add an `else` branch to the `if` after the first block which executes and returns the resulting value from the `else` block when the condition is `false`. For example:\n\n```nu\nif $x > 0 { 'positive' } else { 'non-positive' }\n```\n\nThis time it returns `'positive'` when the condition is `true` (`$x` is greater than zero) and `'non-positive`' when the condition is `false` (`$x` is less than or equal to zero).\n\nWe can also chain multiple `if`s together like the following:\n\n```nu\nif $x > 0 { 'positive' } else if $x == 0 { 'zero' } else { \"negative\" }\n```\n\nWhen the first condition is `true` (`$x` is greater than zero) it will return `'positive'`, when the first condition is `false` and the next condition is `true` (`$x` equals zero) it will return `'zero'`, otherwise it will return `'negative'` (when `$x` is less than zero).\n\n### `match`\n\n[`match`](/commands/docs/match.html) executes one of several conditional branches based on the value given to match. You can also do some [pattern matching](/cookbook/pattern_matching.html) to unpack values in composite types like lists and records.\n\nBasic usage of [`match`](/commands/docs/match.html) can conditionally run different code like a \"switch\" statement common in other languages. [`match`](/commands/docs/match.html) checks if the value after the word [`match`](/commands/docs/match.html) is equal to the value at the start of each branch before the `=>` and if it does, it executes the code after that branch's `=>`.\n\n```nu\nmatch 3 {\n    1 => 'one',\n    2 => {\n        let w = 'w'\n        't' + $w + 'o'\n    },\n    3 => 'three',\n    4 => 'four'\n}\n# => three\n```\n\nThe branches can either return a single value or, as shown in the second branch, can return the results of a [block](/book/types_of_data.html#blocks).\n\n#### Catch all Branch\n\nYou can also have a catch all condition for when the given value doesn't match any of the other conditions by having a branch whose matching value is `_`.\n\n```nu\nlet foo = match 7 {\n    1 => 'one',\n    2 => 'two',\n    3 => 'three',\n    _ => 'other number'\n}\n$foo\n# => other number\n```\n\n(Reminder, [`match`](/commands/docs/match.html) is an expression which is why we can assign the result to `$foo` here).\n\n#### Pattern Matching\n\nYou can \"unpack\" values from types like lists and records with [pattern matching](/cookbook/pattern_matching.html). You can then assign variables to the parts you want to unpack and use them in the matched expressions.\n\n```nu\nlet foo = { name: 'bar', count: 7 }\nmatch $foo {\n    { name: 'bar', count: $it } => ($it + 3),\n    { name: _, count: $it } => ($it + 7),\n    _ => 1\n}\n# => 10\n```\n\nThe `_` in the second branch means it matches any record with field `name` and `count`, not just ones where `name` is `'bar'`.\n\n#### Guards\n\nYou can also add an additional condition to each branch called a \"guard\" to determine if the branch should be matched. To do so, after the matched pattern put `if` and then the condition before the `=>`.\n\n```nu\nlet foo = { name: 'bar', count: 7 }\nmatch $foo {\n    { name: 'bar', count: $it } if $it < 5 => ($it + 3),\n    { name: 'bar', count: $it } if $it >= 5 => ($it + 7),\n    _ => 1\n}\n# => 14\n```\n\n---\n\nYou can find more details about [`match`](/commands/docs/match.html) in the [pattern matching cookbook page](https://www.nushell.sh/cookbook/pattern_matching.html).\n\n## Loops\n\nThe loop commands allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.\n\n### Loops and Other Iterating Commands\n\nThe functionality of the loop commands is similar to commands that apply a closure over elements in a list or table like [`each`](/commands/docs/each.html) or [`where`](/commands/docs/where.html) and many times you can accomplish the same thing with either. For example:\n\n```nu\nmut result = []\nfor $it in [1 2 3] { $result = ($result | append ($it + 1)) }\n$result\n# => ╭───┬───╮\n# => │ 0 │ 2 │\n# => │ 1 │ 3 │\n# => │ 2 │ 4 │\n# => ╰───┴───╯\n\n\n[1 2 3] | each { $in + 1 }\n# => ╭───┬───╮\n# => │ 0 │ 2 │\n# => │ 1 │ 3 │\n# => │ 2 │ 4 │\n# => ╰───┴───╯\n```\n\nWhile it may be tempting to use loops if you're familiar with them in other languages, it is considered more in the [Nushell-style](book/thinking_in_nu.html) (idiomatic) to use commands that apply closures when you can solve a problem either way. The reason for this is because of a pretty big downside with using loops.\n\n#### Loop Disadvantages\n\nThe biggest downside of loops is that they are statements, unlike [`each`](/commands/docs/each.html) which is an expression. Expressions, like [`each`](/commands/docs/each.html) always result in some output value, however statements do not.\n\nThis means that they don't work well with immutable variables and using immutable variables is considered a more [Nushell-style](/book/thinking_in_nu.html#variables-are-immutable). Without a mutable variable declared beforehand in the example in the previous section, it would be impossible to use [`for`](/commands/docs/each.html) to get the list of numbers with incremented numbers, or any value at all.\n\nStatements also don't work in Nushell pipelines which require some output. In fact Nushell will give an error if you try:\n\n```nu\n[1 2 3] | for x in $in { $x + 1 } | $in ++ [5 6 7]\n# => Error: nu::parser::unexpected_keyword\n# => \n# =>   × Statement used in pipeline.\n# =>    ╭─[entry #5:1:1]\n# =>  1 │ [1 2 3] | for x in $in { $x + 1 } | $in ++ [5 6 7]\n# =>    ·           ─┬─\n# =>    ·            ╰── not allowed in pipeline\n# =>    ╰────\n# =>   help: 'for' keyword is not allowed in pipeline. Use 'for' by itself, outside of a pipeline.\n```\n\nBecause Nushell is very pipeline oriented, this means using expression commands like [`each`](/commands/docs/each.html) is typically more natural than loop statements.\n\n#### Loop Advantages\n\nIf loops have such a big disadvantage, why do they exist? Well, one reason is that closures, like [`each`](/commands/docs/each.html) uses, can't modify mutable variables in the surrounding environment. If you try to modify a mutable variable in a closure you will get an error:\n\n```nu\nmut foo = []\n[1 2 3] | each { $foo = ($foo | append ($in + 1)) }\n# => Error: nu::parser::expected_keyword\n# => \n# =>   × Capture of mutable variable.\n# =>    ╭─[entry #8:1:1]\n# =>  1 │ [1 2 3] | each { $foo = ($foo | append ($in + 1)) }\n# =>    ·                  ──┬─\n# =>    ·                    ╰── capture of mutable variable\n# =>    ╰────\n```\n\nIf you modify an environmental variable in a closure, you can, but it will only modify it within the scope of the closure, leaving it unchanged everywhere else. Loops, however, use [blocks](/book/types_of_data.html#blocks) which means they can modify a regular mutable variable or an environmental variable within the larger scope.\n\n```nu\nmut result = []\nfor $it in [1 2 3] { $result = ($result | append ($it + 1)) }\n$result\n# => ╭───┬───╮\n# => │ 0 │ 2 │\n# => │ 1 │ 3 │\n# => │ 2 │ 4 │\n# => ╰───┴───╯\n```\n\n### `for`\n\n[`for`](/commands/docs/for.html) loops over a range or collection like a list or a table.\n\n```nu\nfor x in [1 2 3] { $x * $x | print }\n# => 1\n# => 4\n# => 9\n```\n\n#### Expression Command Alternatives\n\n- [`each`](/commands/docs/each.html)\n- [`par-each`](/commands/docs/par-each.html)\n- [`where`](/commands/docs/where.html)/[`filter`](/commands/docs/filter.html)\n- [`reduce`](/commands/docs/reduce.html)\n\n### `while`\n\n[`while`](/commands/docs/while.html) loops the same block of code until the given condition is `false`.\n\n```nu\nmut x = 0; while $x < 10 { $x = $x + 1 }; $x\n# => 10\n```\n\n#### Expression Command Alternatives\n\nThe \"until\" and other \"while\" commands\n\n- [`take until`](/commands/docs/take_until.html)\n- [`take while`](/commands/docs/take_while.html)\n- [`skip until`](/commands/docs/skip_until.html)\n- [`skip while`](/commands/docs/skip_while.html)\n\n### `loop`\n\n[`loop`](/commands/docs/loop.html) loops a block infinitely. You can use [`break`](/commands/docs/break.html) (as described in the next section) to limit how many times it loops. It can also be handy for continuously running scripts, like an interactive prompt.\n\n```nu\nmut x = 0; loop { if $x > 10 { break }; $x = $x + 1 }; $x\n# => 11\n```\n\n### `break`\n\n[`break`](/commands/docs/break.html) will stop executing the code in a loop and resume execution after the loop. Effectively \"break\"ing out of the loop.\n\n```nu\nfor x in 1..10 { if $x > 3 { break }; print $x }\n# => 1\n# => 2\n# => 3\n```\n\n### `continue`\n\n[`continue`](/commands/docs/continue.html) will stop execution of the current loop, skipping the rest of the code in the loop, and will go to the next loop. If the loop would normally end, like if [`for`](/commands/docs/for.html) has iterated through all the given elements, or if [`while`](/commands/docs/while.html)'s condition is now false, it won't loop again and execution will continue after the loop block.\n\n```nu\nmut x = -1; while $x <= 6 { $x = $x + 1; if $x mod 3 == 0 { continue }; print $x }\n# => 1\n# => 2\n# => 4\n# => 5\n# => 7\n```\n\n## Errors\n\n### `error make`\n\n[`error make`](/commands/docs/error_make.html) creates an error that stops execution of the code and any code that called it, until either it is handled by a [`try`](/commands/docs/try.html) block, or it ends the script and outputs the error message. This functionality is the same as \"exceptions\" in other languages.\n\n```nu\nprint 'printed'; error make { msg: 'Some error info' }; print 'unprinted'\n# => printed\n# => Error:   × Some error info\n# =>    ╭─[entry #9:1:1]\n# =>  1 │ print 'printed'; error make { msg: 'Some error info' }; print 'unprinted'\n# =>    ·                  ─────┬────\n# =>    ·                       ╰── originates from here\n# =>    ╰────\n```\n\nThe record passed to it provides some information to the code that catches it or the resulting error message.\n\nYou can find more information about [`error make`](/commands/docs/error_make.html) and error concepts on the [Creating your own errors page](/book/creating_errors.html).\n\n### `try`\n\n[`try`](/commands/docs/try.html) will catch errors created anywhere in the [`try`](/commands/docs/try.html)'s code block and resume execution of the code after the block.\n\n```nu\ntry { error make { msg: 'Some error info' }}; print 'Resuming'\n# => Resuming\n```\n\nThis includes catching built in errors.\n\n```nu\ntry { 1 / 0 }; print 'Resuming'\n# => Resuming\n```\n\nThe resulting value will be `nothing` if an error occurs and the returned value of the block if an error did not occur.\n\nIf you include a `catch` block after the [`try`](/commands/docs/try.html) block, it will execute the code in the `catch` block if an error occurred in the [`try`](/commands/docs/try.html) block.\n\n```nu\ntry { 1 / 0 } catch { 'An error happened!' } | $in ++ ' And now I am resuming.'\n# => An error happened! And now I am resuming.\n```\n\nIt will not execute the `catch` block if an error did not occur.\n\n`try` also works for external commands:\n\n```nu\ntry { ^nonexisting }; print 'a'\n# => a\n\n^nonexisting; print 'a'\n# => Error: nu::shell::external_command\n# => \n# =>   × External command failed\n# =>    ╭─[entry #3:1:2]\n# =>  1 │ ^nonexisting; print 'a'\n# =>    ·  ─────┬─────\n# =>    ·       ╰── Command `nonexisting` not found\n# =>    ╰────\n# =>   help: `nonexisting` is neither a Nushell built-in or a known external command\n```\n\n## Other\n\n### `return`\n\n[`return`](/commands/docs/return.html) Ends a closure or command early where it is called, without running the rest of the command/closure, and returns the given value. Not often necessary since the last value in a closure or command is also returned, but it can sometimes be convenient.\n\n```nu\ndef 'positive-check' [it] {\n    if $it > 0 {\n        return 'positive'\n    };\n\n    'non-positive'\n}\n```\n\n```nu\npositive-check 3\n# => positive\n\npositive-check (-3)\n# => non-positive\n\nlet positive_check = {|elt| if $elt > 0 { return 'positive' }; 'non-positive' }\n\ndo $positive_check 3\n# => positive\n\ndo $positive_check (-3)\n# => non-positive\n```"

    # How Nushell Code Gets Run

    In [Thinking in Nu](./thinking_in_nu.md#think-of-nushell-as-a-compiled-language), we encouraged you to _"Think of Nushell as a compiled language"_ due to the way in which Nushell code is processed. We also covered several code examples that won't work in Nushell due that process.

    The underlying reason for this is a strict separation of the **_parsing and evaluation_** stages that **_disallows `eval`-like functionality_**. In this section, we'll explain in detail what this means, why we're doing it, and what the implications are. The explanation aims to be as simple as possible, but it might help if you've programmed in another language before.

    [[toc]]

    ## Interpreted vs. Compiled Languages

    ### Interpreted Languages

    Nushell, Python, and Bash (and many others) are _"interpreted"_ languages.

    Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" Nushell program:

    ```nu
    # hello.nu

    print "Hello, World!"
    ```

    Of course, this runs as expected using `nu hello.nu`. A similar program written in Python or Bash would look (and behave) nearly the same.

    In _"interpreted languages"_ code usually gets handled something like this:

    ```text
    Source Code → Interpreter → Result
    ```

    Nushell follows this pattern, and its "Interpreter" is split into two parts:

    1. `Source Code → Parser → Intermediate Representation (IR)`
    2. `IR → Evaluation Engine → Result`

    First, the source code is analyzed by the Parser and converted into an intermediate representation (IR), which in Nushell's case is just a collection of data structures. Then, these data structures are passed to the Engine for evaluation and output of the results.

    This, as well, is common in interpreted languages. For example, Python's source code is typically [converted into bytecode](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/InternalDocs/interpreter.md) before evaluation.

    ### Compiled Languages

    On the other side are languages that are typically "compiled", such as C, C++, or Rust. For example, here's a simple _"Hello, World!"_ in Rust:

    ```rust
    // main.rs

    fn main() {
        println!("Hello, World!");
    }
    ```

    To "run" this code, it must be:

    1. Compiled into [machine code instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code)
    2. The compilation results stored as a binary file on the disk

    The first two steps are handled with `rustc main.rs`.

    3. Then, to produce a result, you need to run the binary (`./main`), which passes the instructions to the CPU

    So:

    1. `Source Code ⇒ Compiler ⇒ Machine Code`
    2. `Machine Code ⇒ CPU ⇒ Result`

    ::: important
    You can see that the compile-run sequence is not much different from the parse-evaluate sequence of an interpreter. You begin with source code, parse (or compile) it into some state (e.g., bytecode, IR, machine code), then evaluate (or run) the IR to get a result. You could think of machine code as just another type of IR and the CPU as its interpreter.

    One big difference, however, between interpreted and compiled languages is that interpreted languages typically implement an _`eval` function_ while compiled languages do not. What does this mean?
    :::

    ## Dynamic vs. Static Languages

    ::: tip Terminology
    In general, the difference between a dynamic and static language is how much of the source code is resolved during Compilation (or Parsing) vs. Evaluation/Runtime:

    - _"Static"_ languages perform more code analysis (e.g., type-checking, [data ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html)) during Compilation/Parsing.

    - _"Dynamic"_ languages perform more code analysis, including `eval` of additional code, during Evaluation/Runtime.

    For the purposes of this discussion, the primary difference between a static and dynamic language is whether or not it has an `eval` function.

    :::

    ### Eval Function

    Most dynamic, interpreted languages have an `eval` function. For example, [Python `eval`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) (also, [Python `exec`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec)) or [Bash `eval`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash).

    The argument to an `eval` is _"source code inside of source code"_, typically conditionally or dynamically computed. This means that, when an interpreted language encounters an `eval` in source code during Parse/Eval, it typically interrupts the normal Evaluation process to start a new Parse/Eval on the source code argument to the `eval`.

    Here's a simple Python `eval` example to demonstrate this (potentially confusing!) concept:

    ```python:line-numbers
    # hello_eval.py

    print("Hello, World!")
    eval("print('Hello, Eval!')")
    ```

    When you run the file (`python hello_eval.py`), you'll see two messages: _"Hello, World!"_ and _"Hello, Eval!"_. Here is what happens:

    1. The entire program is Parsed
    2. (Line 3) `print("Hello, World!")` is Evaluated
    3. (Line 4) In order to evaluate `eval("print('Hello, Eval!')")`:
       1. `print('Hello, Eval!')` is Parsed
       2. `print('Hello, Eval!')` is Evaluated

    ::: tip More fun
    Consider `eval("eval(\"print('Hello, Eval!')\")")` and so on!
    :::

    Notice how the use of `eval` here adds a new "meta" step into the execution process. Instead of a single Parse/Eval, the `eval` creates additional, "recursive" Parse/Eval steps instead. This means that the bytecode produced by the Python interpreter can be further modified during the evaluation.

    Nushell does not allow this.

    As mentioned above, without an `eval` function to modify the bytecode during the interpretation process, there's very little difference (at a high level) between the Parse/Eval process of an interpreted language and that of the Compile/Run in compiled languages like C++ and Rust.

    ::: tip Takeaway
    This is why we recommend that you _"think of Nushell as a compiled language"_. Despite being an interpreted language, its lack of `eval` gives it some of the characteristic benefits as well as limitations common in traditional static, compiled languages.
    :::

    We'll dig deeper into what it means in the next section.

    ## Implications

    Consider this Python example:

    ```python:line-numbers
    exec("def hello(): print('Hello eval!')")
    hello()
    ```

    ::: note
    We're using `exec` in this example instead of `eval` because it can execute any valid Python code rather than being limited to `eval` expressions. The principle is similar in both cases, though.
    :::

    During interpretation:

    1. The entire program is Parsed
    2. In order to Evaluate Line 1:
       1. `def hello(): print('Hello eval!')` is Parsed
       2. `def hello(): print('Hello eval!')` is Evaluated
    3. (Line 2) `hello()` is evaluated.

    Note, that until step 2.2, the interpreter has no idea that a function `hello` even exists! This makes [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) of dynamic languages challenging. In this example, the existence of the `hello` function cannot be checked just by parsing (compiling) the source code. The interpreter must evaluate (run) the code to discover it.

    - In a static, compiled language, a missing function is guaranteed to be caught at compile-time.
    - In a dynamic, interpreted language, however, it becomes a _possible_ runtime error. If the `eval`-defined function is conditionally called, the error may not be discovered until that condition is met in production.

    ::: important
    In Nushell, there are **exactly two steps**:

    1. Parse the entire source code
    2. Evaluate the entire source code

    This is the complete Parse/Eval sequence.
    :::

    ::: tip Takeaway
    By not allowing `eval`-like functionality, Nushell prevents these types of `eval`-related bugs. Calling a non-existent definition is guaranteed to be caught at parse-time in Nushell.

    Furthermore, after parsing completes, we can be certain the bytecode (IR) won't change during evaluation. This gives us a deep insight into the resulting bytecode (IR), allowing for powerful and reliable static analysis and IDE integration which can be challenging to achieve with more dynamic languages.

    In general, you have more peace of mind that errors will be caught earlier when scaling Nushell programs.
    :::

    ## The Nushell REPL

    As with most any shell, Nushell has a _"Read→Eval→Print Loop"_ ([REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)) that is started when you run `nu` without any file. This is often thought of, but isn't quite the same, as the _"commandline"_.

    ::: tip Note
    In this section, the `> ` character at the beginning of a line in a code-block is used to represent the commandline **_prompt_**. For instance:

    ```nu
    > some code...
    ```

    Code after the prompt in the following examples is executed by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. For example:

    ```nu
    > print "Hello world!"
    # => Hello world!

    > ls
    # => prints files and directories...
    ```

    The above means:

    - From inside Nushell (launched with `nu`):
      1. Type `print "Hello world!"`
      1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
      1. Nushell will display the result
      1. Type `ls`
      1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
      1. Nushell will display the result

    :::

    When you press <kbd>Enter</kbd> after typing a commandline, Nushell:

    1. **_(Read):_** Reads the commandline input
    1. **_(Evaluate):_** Parses the commandline input
    1. **_(Evaluate):_** Evaluates the commandline input
    1. **_(Evaluate):_** Merges the environment (such as the current working directory) to the internal Nushell state
    1. **_(Print):_** Displays the results (if non-`null`)
    1. **_(Loop):_** Waits for another input

    In other words, each REPL invocation is its own separate parse-evaluation sequence. By merging the environment back to the Nushell's state, we maintain continuity between the REPL invocations.

    Compare a simplified version of the [`cd` example](./thinking_in_nu.md#example-change-to-a-different-directory-cd-and-source-a-file) from _"Thinking in Nu"_:

    ```nu
    cd spam
    source-env foo.nu
    ```

    There we saw that this cannot work (as a script or other single expression) because the directory will be changed _after_ the parse-time [`source-env` keyword](/commands/docs/source-env.md) attempts to read the file.

    Running these commands as separate REPL entries, however, works:

    ```nu
    > cd spam
    > source-env foo.nu
    # Yay, works!
    ```

    To see why, let's break down what happens in the example:

    1. Read the `cd spam` commandline.
    2. Parse the `cd spam` commandline.
    3. Evaluate the `cd spam` commandline.
    4. Merge environment (including the current directory) into the Nushell state.
    5. Read and Parse `source-env foo.nu`.
    6. Evaluate `source-env foo.nu`.
    7. Merge environment (including any changes from `foo.nu`) into the Nushell state.

    When `source-env` tries to open `foo.nu` during the parsing in Step 5, it can do so because the directory change from Step 3 was merged into the Nushell state during Step 4. As a result, it's visible in the following Parse/Eval cycles.

    ### Multiline REPL Commandlines

    Keep in mind that this only works for **_separate_** commandlines.

    In Nushell, it's possible to group multiple commands into one commandline using:

    - A semicolon:

      ```nu
      cd spam; source-env foo.nu
      ```

    - A newline:

      ```
      > cd span
        source-env foo.nu
      ```

      Notice there is no "prompt" before the second line. This type of multiline commandline is usually created with a [keybinding](./line_editor.md#keybindings) to insert a Newline when <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+ <kbd>Enter</kbd> is pressed.

    These two examples behave exactly the same in the Nushell REPL. The entire commandline (both statements) are processed a single Read→Eval→Print Loop. As such, they will fail the same way that the earlier script-example did.

    ::: tip
    Multiline commandlines are very useful in Nushell, but watch out for any out-of-order Parser-keywords.
    :::

    ## Parse-time Constant Evaluation

    While it is impossible to add parsing into the evaluation stage and yet still maintain our static-language benefits, we can safely add _a little bit_ of evaluation into parsing.

    ::: tip Terminology
    In the text below, we use the term _"constant"_ to refer to:

    - A `const` definition
    - The result of any command that outputs a constant value when provide constant inputs.
      :::

    By their nature, **_constants_** and constant values are known at Parse-time. This, of course, is in sharp contrast to _variable_ declarations and values.

    As a result, we can utilize constants as safe, known arguments to parse-time keywords like [`source`](/commands/docs/source.md), [`use`](/commands/docs/use.md), and related commands.

    Consider [this example](./thinking_in_nu.md#example-dynamically-creating-a-filename-to-be-sourced) from _"Thinking in Nu"_:

    ```nu
    let my_path = "~/nushell-files"
    source $"($my_path)/common.nu"
    ```

    As noted there, we **_can_**, however, do the following instead:

    ```nu:line-numbers
    const my_path = "~/nushell-files"
    source $"($my_path)/common.nu"
    ```

    Let's analyze the Parse/Eval process for this version:

    1. The entire program is Parsed into IR.

       1. Line 1: The `const` definition is parsed. Because it is a constant assignment (and `const` is also a parser-keyword), that assignment can also be Evaluated at this stage. Its name and value are stored by the Parser.
       2. Line 2: The `source` command is parsed. Because `source` is also a parser-keyword, it is Evaluated at this stage. In this example, however, it can be **_successfully_** parsed since its argument is **_known_** and can be retrieved at this point.
       3. The source-code of `~/nushell-files/common.nu` is parsed. If it is invalid, then an error will be generated, otherwise the IR results will be included in evaluation in the next stage.

    2. The entire IR is Evaluated:
       1. Line 1: The `const` definition is Evaluated. The variable is added to the runtime stack.
       2. Line 2: The IR result from parsing `~/nushell-files/common.nu` is Evaluated.

    ::: important

    - An `eval` adds additional parsing during evaluation
    - Parse-time constants do the opposite, adding additional evaluation to the parser.
      :::

    Also keep in mind that the evaluation allowed during parsing is **_very restricted_**. It is limited to only a small subset of what is allowed during a regular evaluation.

    For example, the following is not allowed:

    ```nu
    const foo_contents = (open foo.nu)
    ```

    Put differently, only a small subset of commands and expressions can generate a constant value. For a command to be allowed:

    - It must be designed to output a constant value
    - All of its inputs must also be constant values, literals, or composite types (e.g., records, lists, tables) of literals.

    In general, the commands and resulting expressions will be fairly simple and **_without side effects_**. Otherwise, the parser could all-too-easily enter an unrecoverable state. Imagine, for instance, attempting to assign an infinite stream to a constant. The Parse stage would never complete!

    ::: tip
    You can see which Nushell commands can return constant values using:

    ```nu
    help commands | where is_const
    ```

    :::

    For example, the `path join` command can output a constant value. Nushell also defines several useful paths in the `$nu` constant record. These can be combined to create useful parse-time constant evaluations like:

    ```nu
    const my_startup_modules =  $nu.default-config-dir | path join "my-mods"
    use $"($my_startup_modules)/my-utils.nu"
    ```

    ::: note Additional Notes
    Compiled ("static") languages also tend to have a way to convey some logic at compile time. For instance:

    - C's preprocessor
    - Rust macros
    - [Zig's comptime](https://kristoff.it/blog/what-is-zig-comptime), which was an inspiration for Nushell's parse-time constant evaluation.

    There are two reasons for this:

    1. _Increasing Runtime Performance:_ Logic in the compilation stage doesn't need to be repeated during runtime.

       This isn't currently applicable to Nushell, since the parsed results (IR) are not stored beyond Evaluation. However, this has certainly been considered as a possible future feature.

    2. As with Nushell's parse-time constant evaluations, these features help (safely) work around limitations caused by the absence of an `eval` function.
       :::

    ## Conclusion

    Nushell operates in a scripting language space typically dominated by _"dynamic"_, _"interpreted"_ languages, such as Python, Bash, Zsh, Fish, and many others. Nushell is also _"interpreted"_ since code is run immediately (without a separate, manual compilation).

    However, is not _"dynamic"_ in that it does not have an `eval` construct. In this respect, it shares more in common with _"static"_, compiled languages like Rust or Zig.

    This lack of `eval` is often surprising to many new users and is why it can be helpful to think of Nushell as a compiled, and static, language.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `sorting page of the documentation provided by Nushell`.\n\n\n\nDocumentation text:\n\n# Sorting\n\nNushell offers many ways of sorting data, and which method you reach for will depend on the problem and what kind of data you're working with. Let's take a look at some of the ways you might wish to sort data.\n\n## Basic sorting\n\n### Lists\n\nSorting a basic list works exactly how you might expect:\n\n```nu\n[9 3 8 1 4 6] | sort\n# => ╭───┬───╮\n# => │ 0 │ 1 │\n# => │ 1 │ 3 │\n# => │ 2 │ 4 │\n# => │ 3 │ 6 │\n# => │ 4 │ 8 │\n# => │ 5 │ 9 │\n# => ╰───┴───╯\n```\n\nHowever, things get a bit more complex when you start combining types. For example, let's see what happens when we have a list with numbers _and_ strings:\n\n```nu\n[\"hello\" 4 9 2 1 \"foobar\" 8 6] | sort\n# => ╭───┬────────╮\n# => │ 0 │      1 │\n# => │ 1 │      2 │\n# => │ 2 │      4 │\n# => │ 3 │      6 │\n# => │ 4 │      8 │\n# => │ 5 │      9 │\n# => │ 6 │ foobar │\n# => │ 7 │ hello  │\n# => ╰───┴────────╯\n```\n\nWe can see that the numbers are sorted in order, and the strings are sorted to the end of the list, also in order. If you are coming from other programming languages, this may not be quite what you expect. In Nushell, as a general rule, **data can always be sorted without erroring**.\n\n::: tip\nIf you _do_ want a sort containing differing types to error, see [strict sort](#strict-sort).\n:::\n\nNushell's sort is also **stable**, meaning equal values will retain their original ordering relative to each other. This is illustrated here using the [case insensitive](#case-insensitive-sort) sort option:\n\n```nu\n[\"foo\" \"FOO\" \"BAR\" \"bar\"] | sort -i\n# => ╭───┬─────╮\n# => │ 0 │ BAR │\n# => │ 1 │ bar │\n# => │ 2 │ foo │\n# => │ 3 │ FOO │\n# => ╰───┴─────╯\n```\n\nSince this sort is case insensitive, `foo` and `FOO` are considered equal to each other, and the same is true for `bar` and `BAR`. In the result, the uppercase `BAR` precedes the lowercase `bar`, since the uppercase `BAR` also precedes the lowercase `bar` in the input. Similarly, the lowercase `foo` precedes the uppercase `FOO` in both the input and the result.\n\n### Records\n\nRecords can be sorted two ways: by key, and by value. By default, passing a record to `sort` will sort in order of its keys:\n\n```nu\n{x: 123, a: hello!, foo: bar} | sort\n# => ╭─────┬────────╮\n# => │ a   │ hello! │\n# => │ foo │ bar    │\n# => │ x   │ 123    │\n# => ╰─────┴────────╯\n```\n\nTo instead sort in order of values, use the `-v` flag:\n\n```nu\n{x: 123, a: hello! foo: bar} | sort -v\n# => ╭─────┬────────╮\n# => │ x   │ 123    │\n# => │ foo │ bar    │\n# => │ a   │ hello! │\n# => ╰─────┴────────╯\n```\n\n### Tables\n\nTable rows are sorted by comparing rows by the columns in order. If two rows have equal values in their first column, they are sorted by their second column. This repeats until the rows are sorted different or all columns are equal.\n\n```nu\nlet items = [\n    {id: 100, quantity: 10, price: 5 }\n    {id: 100, quantity: 5,  price: 8 }\n    {id: 100, quantity: 5,  price: 1 }\n]\n$items | sort\n# => ╭───┬─────┬──────────┬───────╮\n# => │ # │ id  │ quantity │ price │\n# => ├───┼─────┼──────────┼───────┤\n# => │ 0 │ 100 │        5 │     1 │\n# => │ 1 │ 100 │        5 │     8 │\n# => │ 2 │ 100 │       10 │     5 │\n# => ╰───┴─────┴──────────┴───────╯\n```\n\nIn this example, the `id` column for all items is equal. Then, the two items with price `5` are sorted before the item with price `10`. Finally, the `item` with quantity `1` is sorted before the item with quantity `8`.\n\n## Sorting structured data\n\n### Cell path\n\nIn order to sort more complex types, such as tables, you can use the `sort-by` command. `sort-by` can order its input by a [cell path](navigating_structured_data.html#cell-paths).\n\nHere's an example directory, sorted by filesize:\n\n```nu\nls | sort-by size\n# => ╭───┬─────────────────────┬──────┬──────────┬────────────────╮\n# => │ # │        name         │ type │   size   │    modified    │\n# => ├───┼─────────────────────┼──────┼──────────┼────────────────┤\n# => │ 0 │ my-secret-plans.txt │ file │    100 B │ 10 minutes ago │\n# => │ 1 │ shopping_list.txt   │ file │    100 B │ 2 months ago   │\n# => │ 2 │ myscript.nu         │ file │  1.1 KiB │ 2 weeks ago    │\n# => │ 3 │ bigfile.img         │ file │ 10.0 MiB │ 3 weeks ago    │\n# => ╰───┴─────────────────────┴──────┴──────────┴────────────────╯\n```\n\nWe can also provide multiple cell paths to `sort-by`, which will sort by each cell path in order of priority. You can think of providing multiple cell paths as a \"tiebreaker\" for elements which have equal values. Let's sort first by size, then by modification time:\n\n```nu\nls | sort-by size modified\n# => ╭───┬─────────────────────┬──────┬──────────┬────────────────╮\n# => │ # │        name         │ type │   size   │    modified    │\n# => ├───┼─────────────────────┼──────┼──────────┼────────────────┤\n# => │ 0 │ shopping_list.txt   │ file │    100 B │ 2 months ago   │\n# => │ 1 │ my-secret-plans.txt │ file │    100 B │ 10 minutes ago │\n# => │ 2 │ myscript.nu         │ file │  1.1 KiB │ 2 weeks ago    │\n# => │ 3 │ bigfile.img         │ file │ 10.0 MiB │ 3 weeks ago    │\n# => ╰───┴─────────────────────┴──────┴──────────┴────────────────╯\n```\n\nThis time, `shopping_list.txt` comes before `my-secret-plans.txt`, since it has an earlier modification time, but two larger files remain sorted after the `.txt` files.\n\nFurthermore, we can use more complex cell paths to sort nested data:\n\n```nu\nlet cities = [\n    {name: 'New York', info: { established: 1624, population: 18_819_000 } }\n    {name: 'Kyoto', info: { established: 794, population: 37_468_000 } }\n    {name: 'São Paulo', info: { established: 1554, population: 21_650_000 } }\n]\n$cities | sort-by info.established\n# => ╭───┬───────────┬────────────────────────────╮\n# => │ # │   name    │            info            │\n# => ├───┼───────────┼────────────────────────────┤\n# => │ 0 │ Kyoto     │ ╭─────────────┬──────────╮ │\n# => │   │           │ │ established │ 794      │ │\n# => │   │           │ │ population  │ 37468000 │ │\n# => │   │           │ ╰─────────────┴──────────╯ │\n# => │ 1 │ São Paulo │ ╭─────────────┬──────────╮ │\n# => │   │           │ │ established │ 1554     │ │\n# => │   │           │ │ population  │ 21650000 │ │\n# => │   │           │ ╰─────────────┴──────────╯ │\n# => │ 2 │ New York  │ ╭─────────────┬──────────╮ │\n# => │   │           │ │ established │ 1624     │ │\n# => │   │           │ │ population  │ 18819000 │ │\n# => │   │           │ ╰─────────────┴──────────╯ │\n# => ╰───┴───────────┴────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\n### Sort by key closure\n\nSometimes, it's useful to sort data in a more complicated manner than \"increasing\" or \"decreasing\". Instead of using `sort-by` with a cell path, you can supply a [closure](types_of_data.html#closures), which will transform each value into a [sorting key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collation#Sort_keys) _without changing the underlying data_. Here's an example of a key closure, where we want to sort a list of assignments by their average grade:\n\n```nu\nlet assignments = [\n    {name: 'Homework 1', grades: [97 89 86 92 89] }\n    {name: 'Homework 2', grades: [91 100 60 82 91] }\n    {name: 'Exam 1', grades: [78 88 78 53 90] }\n    {name: 'Project', grades: [92 81 82 84 83] }\n]\n$assignments | sort-by { get grades | math avg }\n# => ╭───┬────────────┬───────────────────────╮\n# => │ # │    name    │        grades         │\n# => ├───┼────────────┼───────────────────────┤\n# => │ 0 │ Exam 1     │ [78, 88, 78, 53, 90]  │\n# => │ 1 │ Project    │ [92, 81, 82, 84, 83]  │\n# => │ 2 │ Homework 2 │ [91, 100, 60, 82, 91] │\n# => │ 3 │ Homework 1 │ [97, 89, 86, 92, 89]  │\n# => ╰───┴────────────┴───────────────────────╯\n```\n\nThe value is passed into the pipeline input of the key closure, however, you can also use it as a parameter:\n\n```nu\nlet weight = {alpha: 10, beta: 5, gamma: 3}\n[alpha gamma beta gamma alpha] | sort-by {|val| $weight | get $val }\n# => ╭───┬───────╮\n# => │ 0 │ gamma │\n# => │ 1 │ gamma │\n# => │ 2 │ beta  │\n# => │ 3 │ alpha │\n# => │ 4 │ alpha │\n# => ╰───┴───────╯\n```\n\n### Custom sort order\n\nIn addition to [key closures](#sort-by-key-closure), `sort-by` also supports closures which specify a custom sort order. The `--custom`, or `-c`, flag will tell `sort-by` to interpret closures as custom sort closures. A custom sort closure has two parameters, and returns a boolean. The closure should return `true` if the first parameter comes _before_ the second parameter in the sort order.\n\nFor a simple example, we could rewrite a cell path sort as a custom sort. This can be read as \"If $a.size is less than $b.size, a should appear before b in the sort order\":\n\n```nu\nls | sort-by -c {|a, b| $a.size < $b.size }\n# => ╭───┬─────────────────────┬──────┬──────────┬────────────────╮\n# => │ # │        name         │ type │   size   │    modified    │\n# => ├───┼─────────────────────┼──────┼──────────┼────────────────┤\n# => │ 0 │ my-secret-plans.txt │ file │    100 B │ 10 minutes ago │\n# => │ 1 │ shopping_list.txt   │ file │    100 B │ 2 months ago   │\n# => │ 2 │ myscript.nu         │ file │  1.1 KiB │ 2 weeks ago    │\n# => │ 3 │ bigfile.img         │ file │ 10.0 MiB │ 3 weeks ago    │\n# => ╰───┴─────────────────────┴──────┴──────────┴────────────────╯\n```\n\n::: tip\nThe parameters are also passed to the custom closure as a two element list, so the following are equivalent:\n\n- `{|a, b| $a < $b }`\n- `{ $in.0 < $in.1 }`\n  :::\n\nHere's an example of a custom sort which couldn't be trivially written as a key sort. In this example, we have a queue of tasks with some amount of work time and a priority. We want to sort by priority (highest first). If a task has had zero work time, we want to schedule it immediately; otherwise, we ignore the work time.\n\n```nu\nlet queue = [\n    {task: 139, work_time: 0,   priority: 1 }\n    {task: 52,  work_time: 355, priority: 8 }\n    {task: 948, work_time: 72,  priority: 2 }\n    {task: 583, work_time: 0,   priority: 5 }\n]\nlet my_sort = {|a, b|\n    match [$a.work_time, $b.work_time] {\n        [0, 0] => ($a.priority > $b.priority) # fall back to priority if equal work time\n        [0, _] => true, # only a has 0 work time, so a comes before b in the sort order\n        [_, 0] => false, # only b has 0 work time, so a comes after b in the sort order\n        _ => ($a.priority > $b.priority) # both have non-zero work time, sort by priority\n    }\n}\n$queue | sort-by -c $my_sort\n```\n\n## Special sorts\n\n### Case insensitive sort\n\nWhen using case insensitive sort, strings (and globs) which are the same except for different casing will be considered equal for sorting, while other types remain unaffected:\n\n```nu\nlet data = [\n    Nushell,\n    foobar,\n    10,\n    nushell,\n    FoOBaR,\n    9\n]\n$data | sort -i\n# => ╭───┬─────────╮\n# => │ 0 │       9 │\n# => │ 1 │      10 │\n# => │ 2 │ foobar  │\n# => │ 3 │ FoOBaR  │\n# => │ 4 │ Nushell │\n# => │ 5 │ nushell │\n# => ╰───┴─────────╯\n```\n\n### Natural sort\n\nThe [natural sort option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order) allows strings which contain numbers to be sorted in the same way that numbers are normally sorted. This works both for strings which consist solely of numbers, and strings which have numbers and letters:\n\n```nu\nlet data = [\"10\", \"9\", \"foo123\", \"foo20\", \"bar123\", \"bar20\"]\n$data | sort\n# => ╭───┬────────╮\n# => │ 0 │ 10     │\n# => │ 1 │ 9      │\n# => │ 2 │ bar123 │\n# => │ 3 │ bar20  │\n# => │ 4 │ foo123 │\n# => │ 5 │ foo20  │\n# => ╰───┴────────╯\n# \"1\" is sorted before \"9\", so \"10\" is sorted before \"9\"\n$data | sort -n\n# => ╭───┬────────╮\n# => │ 0 │ 9      │\n# => │ 1 │ 10     │\n# => │ 2 │ bar20  │\n# => │ 3 │ bar123 │\n# => │ 4 │ foo20  │\n# => │ 5 │ foo123 │\n# => ╰───┴────────╯\n```\n\nFurthermore, natural sort allows you to sort numbers together with numeric strings:\n\n```nu\nlet data = [4, \"6.2\", 1, \"10\", 2, 8.1, \"3\", 5.5, \"9\", 7]\n$data | sort -n\n# => ╭───┬──────╮\n# => │ 0 │    1 │\n# => │ 1 │    2 │\n# => │ 2 │ 3    │\n# => │ 3 │    4 │\n# => │ 4 │ 5.50 │\n# => │ 5 │ 6.2  │\n# => │ 6 │    7 │\n# => │ 7 │ 8.10 │\n# => │ 8 │ 9    │\n# => │ 9 │ 10   │\n# => ╰───┴──────╯\n```\n\n### Sorting with mixed types\n\nUnder some circumstances, you might need to sort data containing mixed types. There are a couple things to be aware of when sorting mixed types:\n\n- Generally, values of the same type will appear next to each other in the sort order. For example, sorted numbers come first, then sorted strings, then sorted lists.\n- Some types will be intermixed in the sort order. These are:\n  - Integers and floats. For example, `[2.2, 1, 3]` will be sorted as `[1, 2.2, 3]`.\n  - Strings and globs. For example, `[(\"b\" | into glob) a c]` will be sorted as `[a b c]` (where b is still a glob).\n  - If using [natural sort](#natural-sort), integers, floats, and strings will be intermixed as described in that section.\n- The ordering between non-intermixed types is not guaranteed, **except** for `null` values, which will always be sorted to the end of a list.\n  - Within the same Nushell version the ordering should always be the same, but this should not be relied upon. If you have code which is sensitive to the ordering across types, consider using a [custom sort](#custom-sort-order) which better expresses your requirements.\n\nIf you need to sort data which may contain mixed types, consider one of the following strategies:\n\n- [Strict sort](#strict-sort) to disallow sorting of incompatible types\n- [Natural sort](#natural-sort) to sort intermixed numbers and numeric strings\n- A [key sort](#sort-by-key-closure) using [`to text`](/commands/docs/to_text.html), [`to nuon`](/commands/docs/to_nuon.html), or [`to json`](/commands/docs/to_json.html), as appropriate\n- A [custom sort](#custom-sort-order) using [`describe`](/commands/docs/describe.html) to explicitly check types\n\n### Strict sort\n\nCustom sort closures also provide a simple way to sort data while ensuring only types with well-defined comparisons are sorted together. This takes advantage of [operators requiring compatible data types](operators.html#types):\n\n```nu\nlet compatible = [8 3.2 null 58 2]\nlet incompatible = [\"hello\" 4 9 2 1 \"meow\" 8 6]\n$compatible | sort-by -c {|a, b| $a < $b | default ($a != null) }\n# => ╭───┬──────╮\n# => │ 0 │    2 │\n# => │ 1 │ 3.20 │\n# => │ 2 │    8 │\n# => │ 3 │   58 │\n# => │ 4 │      │\n# => ╰───┴──────╯\n$incompatible | sort-by -c {|a, b| $a < $b | default ($a != null) }\n# => Error: nu::shell::type_mismatch\n# => \n# =>   × Type mismatch during operation.\n# =>    ╭─[entry #26:1:36]\n# =>  1 │ $incompatible | sort-by -c {|a, b| $a < $b | default ($a != null) }\n# =>    ·                                    ─┬ ┬ ─┬\n# =>    ·                                     │ │  ╰── string\n# =>    ·                                     │ ╰── type mismatch for operator\n# =>    ·                                     ╰── int\n# =>    ╰────\n```\n\nSpecial handling is required for `null` values, since comparison between any value and `null` returns `null`. To instead reject `null` values, try the following:\n\n```nu\nlet baddata = [8 3.2 null 58 2]\nlet strict = {|a, b|\n    match [$a, $b] {\n        [null, _] => (error make {msg: \"Attempt to sort null\"}),\n        [_, null] => (error make {msg: \"Attempt to sort null\"}),\n        _ => ($a < $b)\n    }\n}\n$baddata | sort-by -c $strict\n# => Error:   × Attempt to sort null\n# =>    ╭─[entry #3:4:21]\n# =>  3 │   match [$a, $b] {\n# =>  4 │       [null, _] => (error make {msg: \"Attempt to sort null\"}),\n# =>    ·                     ─────┬────\n# =>    ·                          ╰── originates from here\n# =>  5 │       [_, null] => (error make {msg: \"Attempt to sort null\"}),\n# =>    ╰────\n```"

    # Custom Commands

    As with any programming language, you'll quickly want to save longer pipelines and expressions so that you can call them again easily when needed.

    This is where custom commands come in.

    ::: tip Note
    Custom commands are similar to functions in many languages, but in Nushell, custom commands _act as first-class commands themselves_. As you'll see below, they are included in the Help system along with built-in commands, can be a part of a pipeline, are parsed in real-time for type errors, and much more.
    :::

    [[toc]]

    ## Creating and Running a Custom Command

    Let's start with a simple `greet` custom command:

    ```nu
    def greet [name] {
      $"Hello, ($name)!"
    }
    ```

    Here, we define the `greet` command, which takes a single parameter `name`. Following this parameter is the block that represents what will happen when the custom command runs. When called, the custom command will set the value passed for `name` as the `$name` variable, which will be available to the block.

    To run this command, we can call it just as we would call built-in commands:

    ```nu
    greet "World"
    # => Hello, World!
    ```

    Documentation text:

    ## Returning Values from Commands

    You might notice that there isn't a `return` or `echo` statement in the example above.

    Like some other languages, such as PowerShell and JavaScript (with arrow functions), Nushell features an _implicit return_, where the value of the final expression in the command becomes its return value.

    In the above example, there is only one expression—The string. This string becomes the return value of the command.

    ```nu
    greet "World" | describe
    # => string
    ```

    A typical command, of course, will be made up of multiple expressions. For demonstration purposes, here's a non-sensical command that has 3 expressions:

    ```nu
    def eight [] {
      1 + 1
      2 + 2
      4 + 4
    }

    eight
    # => 8
    ```

    The return value, again, is simply the result of the _final_ expression in the command, which is `4 + 4` (8).

    Additional examples:

    ::: details Early return
    Commands that need to exit early due to some condition can still return a value using the [`return` statement](/commands/docs/return.md).

    ```nu
    def process-list [] {
      let input_length = length
      if $input_length > 10_000 {
        print "Input list is too long"
        return null
      }

      $in | each {|i|
        # Process the list
        $i * 4.25
      }
    }
    ```

    :::

    ::: details Suppressing the return value
    You'll often want to create a custom command that acts as a _statement_ rather than an expression, and doesn't return a a value.

    You can use the `ignore` keyword in this case:

    ```nu
    def create-three-files [] {
      [ file1 file2 file3 ] | each {|filename|
        touch $filename
      } | ignore
    }
    ```

    Without the `ignore` at the end of the pipeline, the command will return an empty list from the `each` statement.

    You could also return a `null` as the final expression. Or, in this contrived example, use a `for` statement, which doesn't return a value (see next example).
    :::

    ::: details Statements which don't return a value
    Some keywords in Nushell are _statements_ which don't return a value. If you use one of these statements as the final expression of a custom command, the _return value_ will be `null`. This may be unexpected in some cases. For example:

    ```nu
    def exponents-of-three [] {
      for x in [ 0 1 2 3 4 5 ] {
        3 ** $x
      }
    }
    exponents-of-three
    ```

    The above command will not display anything, and the return value is empty, or `null` because `for` is a _statement_ which doesn't return a value.

    To return a value from an input list, use a filter such as the `each` command:

    ````nu
    def exponents-of-three [] {
      [ 0 1 2 3 4 5 ] | each {|x|
        3 ** $x
      }
    }

    ```nu

    def "random file" [] {
      let files = (ls)

    }
    ````

    In this case, the final expression is the `match` statement which can return:

    - `null` if the directory is empty
    - Otherwise, a `record` representing the randomly chosen file

    ## Custom Commands and Pipelines

    Just as with built-in commands, the return value of a custom command can be passed into the next command in a pipeline. Custom commands can also accept pipeline input. In addition, whenever possible, pipeline input and output is streamed as it becomes available.

    ::: tip Important!
    See also: [Pipelines](./pipelines.html)
    :::

    ### Pipeline Output

    ```nu
    ls | get name
    ```

    Let's move [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md) into a command that we've written:

    ```nu
    def my-ls [] { ls }
    ```

    We can use the output from this command just as we would [`ls`](/commands/docs/ls.md).

    ```nu
    my-ls | get name
    # => ╭───┬───────────────────────╮
    # => │ 0 │ myscript.nu           │
    # => │ 1 │ myscript2.nu          │
    # => │ 2 │ welcome_to_nushell.md │
    # => ╰───┴───────────────────────╯
    ```

    This lets us easily build custom commands and process their output. Remember that we don't use return statements like other languages. Instead, the [implicit return](#returning-values-from-a-command) allows us to build pipelines that output streams of data that can be connected to other pipelines.

    ::: tip Note
    The `ls` content is still streamed in this case, even though it is in a separate command. Running this command against a long-directory on a slow (e.g., networked) filesystem would return rows as they became available.
    :::

    ### Pipeline Input

    Custom commands can also take input from the pipeline, just like other commands. This input is automatically passed to the custom command's block.

    Let's make our own command that doubles every value it receives as input:

    ```nu
    def double [] {
      each { |num| 2 * $num }
    }
    ```

    Now, if we call the above command later in a pipeline, we can see what it does with the input:

    ```nu
    [1 2 3] | double
    # => ╭───┬───╮
    # => │ 0 │ 2 │
    # => │ 1 │ 4 │
    # => │ 2 │ 6 │
    # => ╰───┴───╯
    ```

    ::: tip Cool!
    This command demonstrates both input and output _streaming_. Try running it with an infinite input:

    ```nu
    1.. | each {||} | double
    ```

    Even though the input command hasn't ended, the `double` command can still receive and output values as they become available.

    Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop the command.
    :::

    We can also store the input for later use using the [`$in` variable](pipelines.html#pipeline-input-and-the-special-in-variable):

    ```nu
    def nullify [...cols] {
      let start = $in
      $cols | reduce --fold $start { |col, table|
        $table | upsert $col null
      }
    }

    ls | nullify name size
    # => ╭───┬──────┬──────┬──────┬───────────────╮
    # => │ # │ name │ type │ size │   modified    │
    # => ├───┼──────┼──────┼──────┼───────────────┤
    # => │ 0 │      │ file │      │ 8 minutes ago │
    # => │ 1 │      │ file │      │ 8 minutes ago │
    # => │ 2 │      │ file │      │ 8 minutes ago │
    # => ╰───┴──────┴──────┴──────┴───────────────╯

    ## Naming Commands

    In Nushell, a command name can be a string of characters. Here are some examples of valid command names: `greet`, `get-size`, `mycommand123`, `my command`, `命令` (English translation: "command"), and even `😊`.

    Strings which might be confused with other parser patterns should be avoided. For instance, the following command names might not be callable:

    - `1`, `"1"`, or `"1.5"`: Nushell will not allow numbers to be used as command names
    - `4MiB` or `"4MiB"`: Nushell will not allow filesizes to be used as command names
    - `"number#four"` or `"number^four"`: Carets and hash symbols are not allowed in command names
    - `-a`, `"{foo}"`, `"(bar)"`: Will not be callable, as Nushell will interpret them as flags, closures, or expressions.

    While names like `"+foo"` might work, they are best avoided as the parser rules might change over time. When in doubt, keep command names as simple as possible.

    ::: tip
    It's common practice in Nushell to separate the words of the command with `-` for better readability. For example `get-size` instead of `getsize` or `get_size`.
    :::

    ::: tip
    Because `def` is a parser keyword, the command name must be known at parse time. This means that command names may not be a variable or constant. For example, the following is _not allowed_:

    ```nu
    let name = "foo"
    def $name [] { foo }
    ```

    :::

    ### Subcommands

    You can also define subcommands of commands using a space. For example, if we wanted to add a new subcommand to [`str`](/commands/docs/str.md), we can create it by naming our subcommand starting with "str ". For example:

    ```nu
    def "str mycommand" [] {
      "hello"
    }
    ```

    Now we can call our custom command as if it were a built-in subcommand of [`str`](/commands/docs/str.md):

    ```nu
    str mycommand
    ```

    Of course, commands with spaces in their names are defined in the same way:

    ```nu
    def "custom command" [] {
      "This is a custom command with a space in the name!"
    }
    ```

    Documentation text:

    ## Parameters

    ### Multiple parameters

    In the `def` command, the parameters are defined in a [`list`](./types_of_data.md#lists). This means that multiple parameters can be separated with spaces, commas, or line-breaks.

    For example, here's a version of `greet` that accepts two names. Any of these three definitions will work:

    ```nu
    # Spaces
    def greet [name1 name2] {
      $"Hello, ($name1) and ($name2)!"
    }

    # Commas
    def greet [name1, name2] {
      $"Hello, ($name1) and ($name2)!"
    }

    # Linebreaks
    def greet [
      name1
      name2
    ] {
      $"Hello, ($name1) and ($name2)!"
    }
    ```

    ### Required positional parameters

    The basic argument definitions used above are _positional_. The first argument passed into the `greet` command above is assigned to the `name1` parameter (and, as mentioned above, the `$name1` variable). The second argument becomes the `name2` parameter and the `$name2` variable.

    By default, positional parameters are _required_. Using our previous definition of `greet` with two required, positional parameters:

    ```nu
    def greet [name1, name2] {
      $"Hello, ($name1) and ($name2)!"
    }

    greet Wei Mei
    # => Hello, Wei and Mei!

    greet Wei
    # => Error: nu::parser::missing_positional
    # =>
    # =>   × Missing required positional argument.
    # =>    ╭─[entry #1:1:10]
    # =>  1 │ greet Wei
    # =>    ╰────
    # =>   help: Usage: greet <name1> <name2> . Use `--help` for more information.
    ```

    ::: tip
    Try typing a third name after this version of `greet`. Notice that the parser automatically detects the error and highlights the third argument as an error even before execution.
    :::

    ### Optional Positional Parameters

    We can define a positional parameter as optional by putting a question mark (`?`) after its name. For example:

    ```nu
    def greet [name?: string] {
      $"Hello, ($name | default 'You')"
    }

    greet
    # => Hello, You
    ```

    ::: tip
    Notice that the name used to access the variable does not include the `?`; only its definition in the command signature.
    :::

    When an optional parameter is not passed, its value in the command body is equal to `null`. The above example uses the `default` command to provide a default of "You" when `name` is `null`.

    You could also compare the value directly:

    ```nu
    def greet [name?: string] {
      match $name {
        null => "Hello! I don't know your name!"
        _ => $"Hello, ($name)!"
      }
    }

    greet
    # => Hello! I don't know your name!
    ```

    If required and optional positional parameters are used together, then the required parameters must appear in the definition first.

    #### Parameters with a Default Value

    You can also set a default value for the parameter when it is missing. Parameters with a default value are also optional when calling the command.

    ```nu
    def greet [name = "Nushell"] {
      $"Hello, ($name)!"
    }
    ```

    You can call this command either without the parameter or with a value to override the default value:

    ```nu
    greet
    # => Hello, Nushell!

    greet world
    # => Hello, World!
    ```

    You can also combine a default value with a [type annotation](#parameter-types):

    ```nu
    def congratulate [age: int = 18] {
      $"Happy birthday! You are ($age) years old now!"
    }
    ```

    ### Parameter Types

    For each parameter, you can optionally define its type. For example, you can write the basic `greet` command as:

    ```nu
    def greet [name: string] {
      $"Hello, ($name)"
    }
    ```

    If a parameter is not type-annotated, Nushell will treat it as an [`any` type](./types_of_data.html#any). If you annotate a type on a parameter, Nushell will check its type when you call the function.

    For example, let's say you wanted to only accept an `int` instead of a `string`:

    ```nu
    def greet [name: int] {
      $"hello ($name)"
    }

    greet World
    ```

    If we try to run the above, Nushell will tell us that the types don't match:

    ```nu
    Error: nu::parser::parse_mismatch

      × Parse mismatch during operation.
       ╭─[entry #1:1:7]
     1 │ greet World
       ·       ──┬──
       ·         ╰── expected int
       ╰────
    ```

    ::: tip Cool!
    Type checks are a parser feature. When entering a custom command at the command-line, the Nushell parser can even detect invalid argument types in real-time and highlight them before executing the command.

    The highlight style can be changed using a [theme](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/tree/main/themes) or manually using `$env.config.color_config.shape_garbage`.
    :::

    ::: details List of Type Annotations
    Most types can be used as type-annotations. In addition, there are a few "shapes" which can be used. For instance:

    - `number`: Accepts either an `int` or a `float`
    - `path`: A string where the `~` and `.` characters have special meaning and will automatically be expanded to the full-path equivalent. See [Path](/lang-guide/chapters/types/other_types/path.html) in the Language Reference Guide for example usage.
    - `directory`: A subset of `path` (above). Only directories will be offered when using tab-completion for the parameter. Expansions take place just as with `path`.
    - `error`: Available, but currently no known valid usage. See [Error](/lang-guide/chapters/types/other_types/error.html) in the Language Reference Guide for more information.

    The following [types](./types_of_data.html) can be used for parameter annotations:

    - `any`
    - `binary`
    - `bool`
    - `cell-path`
    - `closure`
    - `datetime`
    - `duration`
    - `filesize`
    - `float`
    - `glob`
    - `int`
    - `list`
    - `nothing`
    - `range`
    - `record`
    - `string`
    - `table`
      :::

    ### Flags

    In addition to positional parameters, you can also define named flags.

    For example:

    ```nu
    def greet [
      name: string
      --age: int
    ] {
        {
          name: $name
          age: $age
        }
    }
    ```

    In this version of `greet`, we define the `name` positional parameter as well as an `age` flag. The positional parameter (since it doesn't have a `?`) is required. The named flag is optional. Calling the command without the `--age` flag will set `$age` to `null`.

    The `--age` flag can go before or after the positional `name`. Examples:

    ```nu
    greet Lucia --age 23
    # => ╭──────┬───────╮
    # => │ name │ Lucia │
    # => │ age  │ 23    │
    # => ╰──────┴───────╯

    greet --age 39 Ali
    # => ╭──────┬─────╮
    # => │ name │ Ali │
    # => │ age  │ 39  │
    # => ╰──────┴─────╯

    greet World
    # => ╭──────┬───────╮
    # => │ name │ World │
    # => │ age  │       │
    # => ╰──────┴───────╯
    ```

    Flags can also be defined with a shorthand version. This allows you to pass a simpler flag as well as a longhand, easier-to-read flag.

    Let's extend the previous example to use a shorthand flag for the `age` value:

    ```nu
    def greet [
      name: string
      --age (-a): int
    ] {
        {
          name: $name
          age: $age
        }
      }
    ```

    ::: tip
    The resulting variable is always based on the long flag name. In the above example, the variable continues to be `$age`. `$a` would not be valid.
    :::

    Now, we can call this updated definition using the shorthand flag:

    ```nu
    greet Akosua -a 35
    # => ╭──────┬────────╮
    # => │ name │ Akosua │
    # => │ age  │ 35     │
    # => ╰──────┴────────╯
    ```

    Flags can also be used as basic switches. When present, the variable based on the switch is `true`. When absent, it is `false`.

    ```nu
    def greet [
      name: string
      --caps
    ] {
        let greeting = $"Hello, ($name)!"
        if $caps {
          $greeting | str upcase
        } else {
          $greeting
        }
    }

    greet Miguel --caps
    # => HELLO, MIGUEL!

    greet Chukwuemeka
    # => Hello, Chukwuemeka!
    ```

    You can also assign it to `true`/`false` to enable/disable the flag:

    ```nu
    greet Giulia --caps=false
    # => Hello, Giulia!

    greet Hiroshi --caps=true
    # => HELLO, HIROSHI!
    ```

    ::: tip
    Be careful of the following mistake:

    ```nu
    greet Gabriel --caps true
    ```

    Typing a space instead of an equals sign will pass `true` as a positional argument, which is likely not the desired result!

    To avoid confusion, annotating a boolean type on a flag is not allowed:

    ```nu
    def greet [
        --caps: bool   # Not allowed
    ] { ... }
    ```

    :::

    Flags can contain dashes. They can be accessed by replacing the dash with an underscore in the resulting variable name:

    ```nu
    def greet [
      name: string
      --all-caps
    ] {
        let greeting = $"Hello, ($name)!"
        if $all_caps {
          $greeting | str upcase
        } else {
          $greeting
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Rest parameters

    There may be cases when you want to define a command which takes any number of positional arguments. We can do this with a "rest" parameter, using the following `...` syntax:

    ```nu
    def multi-greet [...names: string] {
      for $name in $names {
        print $"Hello, ($name)!"
      }
    }

    multi-greet Elin Lars Erik
    # => Hello, Elin!
    # => Hello, Lars!
    # => Hello, Erik!
    ```

    We could call the above definition of the `greet` command with any number of arguments, including none at all. All of the arguments are collected into `$names` as a list.

    Rest parameters can be used together with positional parameters:

    ```nu
    def vip-greet [vip: string, ...names: string] {
      for $name in $names {
        print $"Hello, ($name)!"
      }

      print $"And a special welcome to our VIP today, ($vip)!"
    }

    #         $vip          $name
    #         ----- -------------------------
    vip-greet Rahul Priya Arjun Anjali Vikram
    # => Hello, Priya!
    # => Hello, Arjun!
    # => Hello, Anjali!
    # => Hello, Vikram!
    # => And a special welcome to our VIP today, Rahul!
    ```

    To pass a list to a rest parameter, you can use the [spread operator](/book/operators#spread-operator) (`...`). Using the `vip-greet` command definition above:

    ```nu
    let vip = "Tanisha"
    let guests = [ Dwayne, Shanice, Jerome ]
    vip-greet $vip ...$guests
    # => Hello, Dwayne!
    # => Hello, Shanice!
    # => Hello, Jerome!
    # => And a special welcome to our VIP today, Tanisha!
    ```

    ### Rest Parameters with Wrapped External Commands

    Custom commands defined with `def --wrapped` will collect any unknown flags and arguments into a
    rest-parameter which can then be passed, via list-spreading, to an external command. This allows
    a custom command to "wrap" and extend the external command while still accepting all of its original
    parameters. For example, the external `eza` command displays a directory listing. By default, it displays
    a grid arrangement:

    ```nu
    eza commands
    # => categories  docs  README.md
    ```

    We can define a new command `ezal` which will always display a long-listing, adding icons:

    ```nu
    def --wrapped ezal [...rest] {
      eza -l ...$rest
    }
    ```

    :::note
    You could also add `--icons`. We're omitting that in this example simply because those icons don't
    display well in this guide.
    :::

    Notice that `--wrapped` forces any additional parameters into the `rest` parameter, so the command
    can be called with any parameter that `eza` supports. Those additional parameters will be expanded via
    the list-spreading operation `...$rest`.

    ```nu
    ezal commands
    # => drwxr-xr-x   - ntd  7 Feb 11:41 categories
    # => drwxr-xr-x   - ntd  7 Feb 11:41 docs
    # => .rw-r--r-- 936 ntd 14 Jun  2024 README.md

    ezal -d commands
    # => drwxr-xr-x - ntd 14 Jun  2024 commands
    ```

    The custom command can check for certain parameters and change its behavior accordingly. For instance,
    when using the `-G` option to force a grid, we can omit passing a `-l` to `eza`:

    ```nu
    def --wrapped ezal [...rest] {
      if '-G' in $rest {
        eza ...$rest
      } else {
        eza -l --icons ...$rest
      }
    }

    ezal -G commands
    # => categories  docs  README.md
    ```

    Documentation text:

    ## Pipeline Input-Output Signature

    By default, custom commands accept [`<any>` type](./types_of_data.md#any) as pipeline input and likewise can output `<any>` type. But custom commands can also be given explicit signatures to narrow the types allowed.

    For example, the signature for [`str stats`](/commands/docs/str_stats.md) looks like this:

    ```nu
    def "str stats" []: string -> record { }
    ```

    Here, `string -> record` defines the allowed types of the _pipeline input and output_ of the command:

    - It accepts a `string` as pipeline input
    - It outputs a `record`

    If there are multiple input/output types, they can be placed within brackets and separated with commas or newlines, as in [`str join`](/commands/docs/str_join.md):

    ```nu
    def "str join" [separator?: string]: [
      list -> string
      string -> string
    ] { }
    ```

    This indicates that `str join` can accept either a `list<any>` or a `string` as pipeline input. In either case, it will output a `string`.

    Some commands don't accept or require data as pipeline input. In this case, the input type will be `<nothing>`. The same is true for the output type if the command returns `null` (e.g., [`rm`](/commands/docs/rm.md) or [`hide`](/commands/docs/hide.md)):

    ```nu
    def xhide [module: string, members?]: nothing -> nothing { }
    ```

    ::: tip Note
    The example above is renamed `xhide` so that copying it to the REPL will not shadow the built-in `hide` command.
    :::

    Input-output signatures are shown in the `help` for a command (both built-in and custom) and can also be introspected through:

    ```nu
    help commands | where name == <command_name>
    scope commands | where name == <command_name>
    ```

    :::tip Cool!
    Input-Output signatures allow Nushell to catch two additional categories of errors at parse-time:

    - Attempting to return the wrong type from a command. For example:

      ```nu
      def inc []: int -> int {
        $in + 1
        print "Did it!"
      }

      # => Error: nu::parser::output_type_mismatch
      # =>
      # =>   × Command output doesn't match int.
      # =>    ╭─[entry #1:1:24]

      # =>  4 │ ├─▶ }
      # =>    · ╰──── expected int, but command outputs nothing
      # =>    ╰────
      ```

    - And attempting to pass an invalid type into a command:

      ```nu
      def inc []: int -> int { $in + 1 }
      "Hi" | inc
      # => Error: nu::parser::input_type_mismatch
      # =>

    ## Documenting Your Command

    In order to best help users understand how to use your custom commands, you can also document them with additional descriptions for the commands and parameters.

    Run `help vip-greet` to examine our most recent command defined above:

    ```text
    Usage:
      > vip-greet <vip> ...(names)

    Flags:
      -h, --help - Display the help message for this command

    Parameters:
      vip <string>
      ...names <string>

    Input/output types:
      ╭───┬───────┬────────╮
      │ # │ input │ output │
      ├───┼───────┼────────┤
      │ 0 │ any   │ any    │
      ╰───┴───────┴────────╯
    ```

    ::: tip Cool!
    You can see that Nushell automatically created some basic help for the command simply based on our definition so far. Nushell also automatically adds a `--help`/`-h` flag to the command, so users can also access the help using `vip-greet --help`.
    :::

    We can extend the help further with some simple comments describing the command and its parameters:

    ```nu
    # Greet guests along with a VIP
    #
    # Use for birthdays, graduation parties,
    # retirements, and any other event which
    # celebrates an event # for a particular
    # person.
    def vip-greet [
      vip: string        # The special guest
       ...names: string  # The other guests
    ] {
      for $name in $names {
        print $"Hello, ($name)!"
      }

      print $"And a special welcome to our VIP today, ($vip)!"
    }
    ```

    Now run `help vip-greet` again to see the difference:

    ```text
    Greet guests along with a VIP

    Use for birthdays, graduation parties,
    retirements, and any other event which
    celebrates an event # for a particular
    person.

    Category: default

    This command:
    - does not create a scope.
    - is not a built-in command.
    - is not a subcommand.
    - is not part of a plugin.
    - is a custom command.
    - is not a keyword.

    Usage:
      > vip-greet <vip>


    Flags:


      -h, --help - Display the help message for this command

    Signatures:

      <any> | vip-greet[ <string>] -> <any>

    Parameters:

      vip: <string> The special guest
      ...rest: <string> The other guests
    ```

    Notice that the comments on the lines immediately before the `def` statement become a description of the command in the help system. Multiple lines of comments can be used. The first line (before the blank-comment line) becomes the Help `description`. This information is also shown when tab-completing commands.

    The remaining comment lines become its `extra_description` in the help data.

    ::: tip
    Run:

    ```nu
    scope commands
    | where name == 'vip-greet'
    | wrap help
    ```

    This will show the Help _record_ that Nushell creates.
    :::

    The comments following the parameters become their description. Only a single-line comment is valid for parameters.

    A Nushell comment that continues on the same line for argument documentation purposes requires a space before the ` #` pound sign.

    Documentation text:

    ## Changing the Environment in a Custom Command

    Normally, environment variable definitions and changes are [_scoped_ within a block](./environment.html#scoping). This means that changes to those variables are lost when they go out of scope at the end of the block, including the block of a custom command.

    ```nu
    def foo [] {
        $env.FOO = 'After'
    }

    $env.FOO = "Before"
    foo
    $env.FOO
    # => Before
    ```

    However, a command defined using [`def --env`](/commands/docs/def.md) or [`export def --env`](/commands/docs/export_def.md) (for a [Module](modules.md)) will preserve the environment on the caller's side:

    ```nu
    def --env foo [] {
        $env.FOO = 'After'
    }

    $env.FOO = "Before"
    foo
    $env.FOO
    # => After
    ```

    ### Changing Directories (cd) in a Custom Command

    Likewise, changing the directory using the `cd` command results in a change of the `$env.PWD` environment variable. This means that directory changes (the `$env.PWD` variable) will also be reset when a custom command ends. The solution, as above, is to use `def --env` or `export def --env`.

    ```nu
    def --env go-home [] {
      cd ~
    }

    cd /
    go-home
    pwd
    # => Your home directory
    ```

    Documentation text:

    # Stdout, Stderr, and Exit Codes

    An important piece of interop between Nushell and external commands is working with the standard streams of data coming from the external.

    The first of these important streams is stdout.

    ## Stdout

    Stdout is the way that most external apps will send data into the pipeline or to the screen. Data sent by an external app to its stdout is received by Nushell by default if it's part of a pipeline:

    ```nu
    external | str join
    ```

    The above would call the external named `external` and would redirect the stdout output stream into the pipeline. With this redirection, Nushell can then pass the data to the next command in the pipeline, here [`str join`](/commands/docs/str_join.md).

    Without the pipeline, Nushell will not do any redirection, allowing it to print directly to the screen.

    ## Stderr

    Another common stream that external applications often use to print error messages is stderr. By default, Nushell does not do any redirection of stderr, which means that by default it will print to the screen.

    ## Exit Code

    Finally, external commands have an "exit code". These codes help give a hint to the caller whether the command ran successfully.

    Nushell tracks the last exit code of the recently completed external in one of two ways. The first way is with the `LAST_EXIT_CODE` environment variable.

    ```nu
    do { external }
    $env.LAST_EXIT_CODE
    ```

    The second way is to use the [`complete`](/commands/docs/complete.md) command.

    ## Using the [`complete`](/commands/docs/complete.md) command

    The [`complete`](/commands/docs/complete.md) command allows you to run an external to completion, and gather the stdout, stderr, and exit code together in one record.

    If we try to run the external `cat` on a file that doesn't exist, we can see what [`complete`](/commands/docs/complete.md) does with the streams, including the redirected stderr:

    ```nu
    cat unknown.txt | complete
    # => ╭───────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────╮
    # => │ stdout    │                                             │
    # => │ stderr    │ cat: unknown.txt: No such file or directory │
    # => │ exit_code │ 1                                           │
    # => ╰───────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────╯
    ```

    ## `echo`, `print`, and `log` commands

    The [`echo`](/commands/docs/echo.md) command is mainly for _pipes_. It returns its arguments, ignoring the piped-in value. There is usually little reason to use this over just writing the values as-is.

    In contrast, the [`print`](/commands/docs/print.md) command prints the given values to stdout as plain text. It can be used to write to standard error output, as well. Unlike [`echo`](/commands/docs/echo.md), this command does not return any value (`print | describe` will return "nothing"). Since this command has no output, there is no point in piping it with other commands.

    The [standard library](/book/standard_library.md) has commands to write out messages in different logging levels. For example:

    @[code](@snippets/book/std_log.nu)

    ![Log message examples](../assets/images/0_79_std_log.png)

    The log level for output can be set with the `NU_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable:

    ```nu
    NU_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG nu std_log.nu
    ```

    ## File Redirections

    If you want to redirect stdout of an external command to a file, you can use `out>` followed by a file path. Similarly, you can use `err>` to redirect stderr:

    ```nu
    cat unknown.txt out> out.log err> err.log
    ```

    If you want to redirect both stdout and stderr to the same file, you can use `out+err>`:

    ```nu
    cat unknown.txt out+err> log.log
    ```

    Note that `out` can be shortened to just `o`, and `err` can be shortened to just `e`. So, the following examples are equivalent to the previous ones above:
    ```nu
    cat unknown.txt o> out.log e> err.log

    cat unknown.txt o+e> log.log
    ```

    Also, any expression can be used for the file path, as long as it is a string value:
    ```nu
    use std
    cat unknown.txt o+e> (std null-device)
    ```

    Note that file redirections are scoped to an expression and apply to all external commands in the expression. In the example below, `out.txt` will contain `hello\nworld`:
    ```nu
    let text = "hello\nworld"
    ($text | head -n 1; $text | tail -n 1) o> out.txt
    ```
    Pipes and additional file redirections inside the expression will override any file redirections applied from the outside.

    ## Pipe Redirections

    If a regular pipe `|` comes after an external command, it redirects the stdout of the external command as input to the next command. To instead redirect the stderr of the external command, you can use the stderr pipe, `err>|` or `e>|`:

    ```nu
    cat unknown.txt e>| str upcase
    ```

    Of course, there is a corresponding pipe for combined stdout and stderr, `out+err>|` or `o+e>|`:

    ```nu
    nu -c 'print output; print -e error' o+e>| str upcase
    ```

    Unlike file redirections, pipe redirections do not apply to all commands inside an expression. Rather, only the last command in the expression is affected. For example, only `cmd2` in the snippet below will have its stdout and stderr redirected by the pipe.
    ```nu
    (cmd1; cmd2) o+e>| cmd3
    ```

    ## Raw Streams

    Both stdout and stderr are represented as "raw streams" inside of Nushell. These are streams of bytes rather than the structured data used by internal Nushell commands.

    Because streams of bytes can be difficult to work with, especially given how common it is to use output as if it was text data, Nushell attempts to convert raw streams into text data. This allows other commands to pull on the output of external commands and receive strings they can further process.

    Nushell attempts to convert to text using UTF-8. If at any time the conversion fails, the rest of the stream is assumed to always be bytes.

    If you want more control over the decoding of the byte stream, you can use the [`decode`](/commands/docs/decode.md) command. The [`decode`](/commands/docs/decode.md) command can be inserted into the pipeline after the external, or other raw stream-creating command, and will handle decoding the bytes based on the argument you give decode. For example, you could decode shift-jis text this way:

    ```nu
    0x[8a 4c] | decode shift-jis
    # => 貝
    ```

    # Directory Stack

    Like some other shells, Nushell provides a Directory Stack feature for easily switching between multiple directories. In Nushell, this feature is part of the [Standard Library](./standard_library.md) and can be accessed in several ways.

    ::: note
    In Nushell, the "stack" is represented as a `list`, but the overall functionality is similar to that of other shells.

    ## `dirs` Module and Commands

    To use the `dirs` command and its subcommands, first import the module using:

    ```nu
    use std/dirs
    ```

    ::: tip
    To make the feature available whenever you start Nushell, add the above command to your [startup configuration](./configuration.md).
    :::

    This makes several new commands available:

    | Command     | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
    | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `dirs`      | Lists the directories on the stack                                                                                                                                  |
    | `dirs add`  | Adds one or more directories to the list. The first directory listed becomes the new active directory. Similar to the `pushd` command in some other shells.         |
    | `dirs drop` | Drops the current directory from the list. The previous directory in the list becomes the new active directory. Similar to the `popd` command in some other shells. |
    | `dirs goto` | Jumps to directory by using its index in the list                                                                                                                   |
    | `dirs next` | Makes the next directory on the list the active directory. If the current active directory is the last in the list, then cycle to the start of the list.            |
    | `dirs prev` | Makes the previous directory on the list the active directory. If the current active directory is the first in the list, then cycle to the end of the list.         |

    When we start using `dirs`, there is only one directory in the list, the active one. You can, as always, change this directory using the `cd` command.

    ```nu
    cd ~
    use std/dirs
    dirs
    # => ╭───┬────────┬─────────────────────────────────╮
    # => │ # │ active │              path               │
    # => ├───┼────────┼─────────────────────────────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ true   │ /home/myuser                    │
    # => ╰───┴────────┴─────────────────────────────────╯

    cd ~/src/repo/nushell
    dirs
    # => ╭───┬────────┬─────────────────────────────────╮
    # => │ # │ active │              path               │
    # => ├───┼────────┼─────────────────────────────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ true   │ /home/myuser/repo/nushell       │
    # => ╰───┴────────┴─────────────────────────────────╯
    ```

    Notice that `cd` only changes the Active directory.

    To _add_ the current directory to the list, change to a new active directory using the `dirs add` command:

    ```nu
    dirs add ../reedline
    dirs
    # => ╭───┬────────┬──────────────────────────────────╮
    # => │ # │ active │               path               │
    # => ├───┼────────┼──────────────────────────────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ false  │ /home/myuser/src/repo/nushell    │
    # => │ 1 │ true   │ /home/myuser/src/repo/reedline   │
    # => ╰───┴────────┴──────────────────────────────────╯
    ```

    Let's go ahead and add a few more commonly used directories to the list:

    ```nu
    dirs add ../nu_scripts
    dirs add ~
    dirs
    # => ╭───┬────────┬────────────────────────────────────╮
    # => │ # │ active │                path                │
    # => ├───┼────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ false  │ /home/myuser/src/repo/nushell      │
    # => │ 1 │ false  │ /home/myuser/src/repo/reedline     │
    # => │ 2 │ false  │ /home/myuser/src/repo/nu_scripts   │
    # => │ 3 │ true   │ /home/myuser                       │
    # => ╰───┴────────┴────────────────────────────────────╯
    ```

    We can now switch between them easily using `dirs next`, `dirs prev` or `dirs goto`:

    ```nu
    dirs next
    # Active was 3, is now 0
    pwd
    # => /home/myuser/src/repo/nushell
    dirs goto 2
    # => /home/myuser/src/repo/nu_scripts
    ```

    When you have finished your work in a directory, you can drop it from the list using:

    ```nu
    dirs drop
    dirs
    # => ╭───┬────────┬──────────────────────────────────╮
    # => │ # │ active │               path               │
    # => ├───┼────────┼──────────────────────────────────┤
    # => │ 0 │ false  │ /home/myuser/src/repo/nushell    │
    # => │ 1 │ true   │ /home/myuser/src/repo/reedline   │
    # => │ 2 │ false  │ /home/myuser                     │
    # => ╰───┴────────┴──────────────────────────────────╯
    ```

    When we drop `nu_scripts` from the list, the previous directory (`reedline`) becomes active.

    ## `shells` Aliases

    Some users may prefer to think of this feature as multiple "shells within shells", where each has its own directory.

    The Standard Library provides a set of aliases that can be used in place of the `dirs` commands above.

    Import them using:

    ```nu
    use std/dirs shells-aliases *
    ```

    The built-in aliases are:

    | Alias    | Description                                              |
    | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `shells` | in place of `dirs` to list current "shells"/directories. |
    | `enter`  | in place of `dirs add` to enter a new "shell"/dir.       |
    | `dexit`  | in place of `dirs drop` to exit a "shell"/dir.           |
    | `g`      | as an alias for `dirs goto`.                             |
    | `n`      | for `dirs next`                                          |
    | `p`      | for `dirs prev`                                          |

    Of course, you can also define your own aliases if desired.

    The example above uses the [Standard Library](../standard_library.md), a collection of modules built-in to Nushell. Because it is readily available to all Nushell users, we'll also use it for several of the examples below.
    :::

    ## Installing Modules

    Installing a module is simply a matter of placing its files in a directory. This might be done via `git clone` (or other version control system), a package manager such as `nupm`, or manually. The module's documentation should provide recommendations.

    ## Importing Modules

    Anything after the [`use`](/commands/docs/use.md) keyword forms an **import pattern** which controls how the definitions are imported.

    Notice above that `use` has two arguments:

    - A path to the module
    - (Optional) The definitions to import

    The module's documentation will usually tell you the recommended way to import it. However, it can still be useful to understand the options available:

    ### Module Path

    The path to the module can be:

    - An absolute path to a directory containing a `mod.nu` file:

      ::: details Example

      ```nu
      use ~/nushell/modules/nupm
      ```

      Note that the module name (i.e., its directory) can end in a `/` (or `\` on Windows), but as with most commands that take paths (e.g., `cd`), this is completely optional.

      :::

    - A relative path to a directory containing a `mod.nu` file:

      ::: details Example

      ```nu
      # cd then use the mod.nu in the relative nupm directory
      cd ~/nushell/modules
      use nupm
      # or
      use nupm/
      ```

      Note that the module name (its directory) can end in a `/` (or `\` on Windows), but as with most commands that take a paths (e.g., `cd`), this is completely optional.
      :::

      ::: important Important! Importing modules from `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS`
      When importing a module via a relative path, Nushell first searches from the current directory. If a matching module is not found at that location, Nushell then searches each directory in the `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS` list.

      This allows you to install modules to a location that is easily accessible via a relative path regardless of the current directory.
      :::

    - An absolute or relative path to a Nushell module file. As above, Nushell will search the `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS` for a matching relative path.

      ::: details Example

      ```nu
      use ~/nushell/modules/std-rfc/bulk-rename.nu
      # Or
      cd ~/nushell/modules
      use std-rfc/bulk-rename.nu
      ```

      :::

    - A virtual directory:

      ::: details Example
      The standard library modules mentioned above are stored in a virtual filesystem with a `std` directory. Consider this an alternate form of the "absolute path" examples above.

      ```nu
      use std/assert
      assert equal 'string1' "string1"
      ```

      :::

    - Less commonly, the name of a module already created with the [`module`](/commands/docs/module.md) command. While it is possible to use this command to create a module at the commandline, this isn't common or useful. Instead, this form is primarily used by module authors to define a submodule. See [Creating Modules - Submodules](./creating_modules.md#submodules).

    ### Module Definitions

    The second argument to the `use` command is an optional list of the definitions to import. Again, the module documentation should provide recommendations. For example, the [Standard Library Chapter](../standard_library.md#importing-submodules) covers the recommended imports for each submodule.

    Of course, you always have the option to choose a form that works best for your use-case.

    - **Import an entire module/submodule as a command with subcommands**

      In an earlier example above, we imported the `std/log` module without specifying the definitions:

      ```nu
      use std/log
      log info "Hello, std/log Module"
      ```

      Notice that this imports the `log` submodule with all of its _subcommands_ (e.g., `log info`, `log error`, etc.) into the current scope.

      Compare the above to the next version, where the command becomes `std log info`:

      ```nu
      use std
      std log info "Hello, std Module"
      ```

    - **Import all of the definitions from a module**

      Alternatively, you can import the definitions themselves into the current scope. For example:

      ```nu
      use std/formats *
      ls | to jsonl
      ```

      Notice how the `to jsonl` command is placed directly in the current scope, rather than being a subcommand of `formats`.

    - **Import one or more definitions from a module**

      Nushell can also selectively import a subset of the definitions of a module. For example:

      ```nu
      use std/math PI
      let circle = 2 * $PI * $radius
      ```

      Keep in mind that the definitions can be:

      - Commands
      - Aliases
      - Constants
      - Externs
      - Other modules (as submodules)
      - Environment variables (always imported)

      Less commonly, a list of imports can also be used:

      ```nu
      use std/formats [ 'from ndjson' 'to ndjson' ]
      ```

      ::: note Importing submodules
      While you can import a submodule by itself using `use <module> </submodule>` (e.g., `use std help`), the entire parent module and _all_ of its definitions (and thus submodules) will be _parsed_ when using this form. When possible, loading the submodule as a _module_ will result in faster code. For example:

      ```nu
      # Faster
      use std/help
      ```

      :::

    ## Importing Constants

    As seen above with the `std/math` examples, some modules may export constant definitions. When importing the entire module, constants can be accessed through a record with the same name as the module:

    ```nu
    # Importing entire module - Record access
    use std/math
    $math.PI
    # => 3.141592653589793

    $math
    # => ╭───────┬──────╮
    # => │ GAMMA │ 0.58 │
    # => │ E     │ 2.72 │
    # => │ PI    │ 3.14 │
    # => │ TAU   │ 6.28 │
    # => │ PHI   │ 1.62 │
    # => ╰───────┴──────╯

    # Or importing all of the module's members
    use std/math *
    $PI
    # => 3.141592653589793
    ```

    ## Hiding

    Any custom command or alias, whether imported from a module or not, can be "hidden" to restore the previous definition using
    the [`hide`](/commands/docs/hide.md) command.

    The `hide` command also accepts import patterns, similar to [`use`](/commands/docs/use.md), but interprets them slightly differently. These patterns can be one of the following:

    - If the name is a custom command, the `hide` command hides it directly.
    - If the name is a module name, it hides all of its exports prefixed with the module name

    For example, using `std/assert`:

    ```nu
    use std/assert
    assert equal 1 2
    # => Assertion failed
    assert true
    # => Assertion passes

    hide assert
    assert equal 1 1
    # => Error:
    # => help: A command with that name exists in module `assert`. Try importing it with `use`

    assert true
    # => Error:
    # => help: A command with that name exists in module `assert`. Try importing it with `use`
    ```

    Just as you can `use` a subset of the module's definitions, you can also `hide` them selectively as well:

    ```nu
    use std/assert
    hide assert main
    assert equal 1 1
    # => assertion passes

    assert true
    # => Error:
    # => help: A command with that name exists in module `assert`. Try importing it with `use`
    ```

    ::: tip
    `main` is covered in more detail in [Creating Modules](./creating_modules.md#main-exports), but for end-users, `main` simply means "the command named the same as the module." In this case the `assert` module exports a `main` command that "masquerades" as the `assert` command. Hiding `main` has the effect of hiding the `assert` command, but not its subcommands.

    # Creating Modules

    [[toc]]

    ::: important
    When working through the examples below, it is recommended that you start a new shell before importing an updated version of each module or command. This will help reduce any confusion caused by definitions from previous imports.
    :::

    ## Overview

    Modules (and Submodules, to be covered below) are created in one of two ways:

    - Most commonly, by creating a file with a series of `export` statements of definitions to be exported from the module.
    - For submodules inside a module, using the `module` command

    ::: tip
    While it's possible to use the `module` command to create a module directly at the commandline, it's far more useful and common to store the module definitions in a file for reusability.
    :::

    The module file can be either:

    - A file named `mod.nu`, in which case its _directory_ becomes the module name
    - Any other `<module_name>.nu` file, in which case the filename becomes the module name

    ### Simple Module Example

    Create a file named `inc.nu` with the following:

    ```nu
    export def increment []: int -> int  {
        $in + 1
    }
    ```

    This is a module! We can now import it and use the `increment` command:

    ```nu
    use inc.nu *
    5 | increment
    # => 6
    ```

    Of course, you can easily distribute a file like this so that others can make use of the module as well.

    ## Exports

    We covered the types of definitions that are available in modules briefly in the main Modules Overview above. While this might be enough explanation for an end-user, module authors will need to know _how_ to create the export definitions for:

    - Commands ([`export def`](/commands/docs/export_def.md))
    - Aliases ([`export alias`](/commands/docs/export_alias.md))
    - Constants ([`export const`](/commands/docs/export_const.md))
    - Known externals ([`export extern`](/commands/docs/export_extern.md))
    - Submodules ([`export module`](/commands/docs/export_module.md))
    - Imported symbols from other modules ([`export use`](/commands/docs/export_use.md))
    - Environment setup ([`export-env`](/commands/docs/export-env.md))

    ::: tip
    Only definitions marked with `export` (or `export-env` for environment variables) are accessible when the module is imported. Definitions not marked with `export` are only visible from inside the module. In some languages, these would be called "private" or "local" definitions. An example can be found below in [Additional Examples](#local-definitions).
    :::

    ### `main` Exports

    ::: important
    An export cannot have the same name as that of the module itself.
    :::

    In the [Basic Example](#basic-module-example) above, we had a module named `inc` with a command named `increment`. However, if we rename that file to `increment.nu`, it will fail to import.

    ```nu
    mv inc.nu increment.nu
    use increment.nu *
    # => Error: nu::parser::named_as_module
    # => ...
    # => help: Module increment can't export command named
    # => the same as the module. Either change the module
    # => name, or export `main` command.
    ```

    As helpfully mentioned in the error message, you can simply rename the export `main`, in which case it will take on the name of the module when imported. Edit the `increment.nu` file:

    ```nu
    export def main []: int -> int {
        $in + 1
    }
    ```

    Now it works as expected:

    ```nu
    use ./increment.nu
    2024 | increment
    # => 2025
    ```

    ::: note
    `main` can be used for both `export def` and `export extern` definitions.
    :::

    ::: tip
    `main` definitions are imported in the following cases:

    - The entire module is imported with `use <module>` or `use <module.nu>`
    - The `*` glob is used to import all of the modules definitions (e.g., `use <module> *`, etc.)
    - The `main` definition is explicitly imported with `use <module> main`, `use <module> [main]`, etc.)

    Conversely, the following forms do _not_ import the `main` definition:

    ````nu
    use <module> <other_definition>
    # or
    use <module> [ <other_definitions> ]
    :::

    ::: note
    Additionally, `main` has special behavior if used in a script file, regardless of whether it is exported or not. See the [Scripts](scripts.html#parameterizing-scripts) chapter for more details.
    :::

    ## Module Files

    As mentioned briefly in the Overview above, modules can be created either as:

    1. `<module_name>.nu`: "File-form" - Useful for simple modules
    2. `<module_name>/mod.nu`: "Directory-form" - Useful for organizing larger module projects where submodules can easily map to subdirectories of the main module

    The `increment.nu` example above is clearly an example of (1) the file-form. Let's try converting it to the directory-form:

    ```nu
    mkdir increment
    mv increment.nu increment/mod.nu

    use increment *
    41 | increment
    # => 42
    ````

    Notice that the behavior of the module once imported is identical regardless of whether the file-form or directory-form is used; only its path changes.

    ::: note
    Technically, you can import this either using the directory form above or explicitly with `use increment/mod.nu *`, but the directory shorthand is preferred when using a `mod.nu`.
    :::

    ## Subcommands

    As covered in [Custom Commands](../custom_commands.md), subcommands allow us to group commands logically. Using modules, this can be done in one of two ways:

    1. As with any custom command, the command can be defined as `"<command> <subcommand>"`, using a space inside quotes. Let's add an `increment by` subcommand to the `increment` module we defined above:

    ```nu
    export def main []: int -> int {
        $in + 1
    }

    export def "increment by" [amount: int]: int -> int {
        $in + $amount
    }
    ```

    It can then be imported with `use increment *` to load both the `increment` command and `increment by` subcommand.

    2. Alternatively, we can define the subcommand simply using the name `by`, since importing the entire `increment` module will result in the same commands:

    ```nu
    export def main []: int -> int {
        $in + 1
    }

    export def by [amount: int]: int -> int {
        $in + $amount
    }
    ```

    This module is imported using `use increment` (without the glob `*`) and results in the same `increment` command and `increment by` subcommand.

    ::: note
    We'll continue to use this version for further examples below, so notice that the import pattern has changed to `use increment` (rather than `use increment *`) below.
    :::

    ## Submodules

    Submodules are modules that are exported from another module. There are two ways to add a submodule to a module:

    1. With `export module`: Exports (a) the submodule and (b) its definitions as members of the submodule
    2. With `export use`: Exports (a) the submodule and (b) its definitions as members of the parent module

    To demonstrate the difference, let's create a new `my-utils` module, with our `increment` example as a submodule. Additionally, we'll create a new `range-into-list` command in its own submodule.

    1. Create a directory for the new `my-utils` and move the `increment.nu` into it

       ```nu
       mkdir my-utils
       # Adjust the following as needed
       mv increment/mod.nu my-utils/increment.nu
       rm increment
       cd my-utils
       ```

    2. In the `my-utils` directory, create a `range-into-list.nu` file with the following:

       ```nu
       export def main []: range -> list {
           # It looks odd, yes, but the following is just
           # a simple way to convert ranges to lists
           each {||}
       }
       ```

    3. Test it:

       ```nu
       use range-into-list.nu
       1..5 | range-into-list | describe
       # => list<int> (stream)
       ```

    4. We should now have a `my-utils` directory with the:

       - `increment.nu` module
       - `range-into-list.nu` module

    The following examples show how to create a module with submodules.

    ### Example: Submodule with `export module`

    The most common form for a submodule definition is with `export module`.

    1. Create a new module named `my-utils`. Since we're in the `my-utils` directory, we will create a `mod.nu` to define it. This version of `my-utils/mod.nu` will contain:

       ```nu
       export module ./increment.nu
       export module ./range-into-list.nu
       ```

    2. We now have a module `my-utils` with the two submodules. Try it out:

       ```nu
       # Go to the parent directory of my-utils
       cd ..
       use my-utils *
       5 | increment by 4
       # => 9

       let file_indices = 0..2..<10 | range-into-list
       ls | select ...$file_indices
       # => Returns the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th file in the directory
       ```

    Before proceeding to the next section, run `scope modules` and look for the `my-utils` module. Notice that it has no commands of its own; just the two submodules.

    ### Example: Submodule with `export use`

    Alternatively, we can (re)export the _definitions_ from other modules. This is slightly different from the first form, in that the commands (and other definitions, if they were present) from `increment` and `range-into-list` become _members_ of the `my-utils` module itself. We'll be able to see the difference in the output of the `scope modules` command.

    Let's change `my-utils/mod.nu` to:

    ```nu
    export use ./increment.nu
    export use ./range-into-list.nu
    ```

    Try it out using the same commands as above:

    ```nu
    # Go to the parent directory of my-utils
    cd ..
    use my-utils *
    5 | increment by 4
    # => 9

    let file_indices = 0..2..<10 | range-into-list
    ls / | sort-by modified | select ...$file_indices
    # => Returns the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th file in the directory, oldest-to-newest
    ```

    Run `scope modules` again and notice that all of the commands from the submodules are re-exported into the `my-utils` module.

    ::: tip
    While `export module` is the recommended and most common form, there is one module-design scenario in which `export use` is required -- `export use` can be used to _selectively export_ definitions from the submodule, something `export module` cannot do. See [Additional Examples - Selective Export](#selective-export-from-a-submodule) for an example.
    :::

    ::: note
    `module` without `export` defines only a local module; it does not export a submodule.
    :::

    ## Documenting Modules

    As with [custom commands](../custom_commands.md#documenting-your-command), modules can include documentation that can be viewed with `help <module_name>`. The documentation is simply a series of commented lines at the beginning of the module file. Let's document the `my-utils` module:

    ```nu
    # A collection of helpful utility functions

    export use ./increment.nu
    export use ./range-into-list.nu
    ```

    Now examine the help:

    ```nu
    use my-utils *
    help my-utils

    # => A collection of helpful utility functions
    ```

    Also notice that, because the commands from `increment` and `range-into-list` are re-exported with `export use ...`, those commands show up in the help for the main module as well.

    ## Environment Variables

    Modules can define an environment using [`export-env`](/commands/docs/export-env.md). Let's extend our `my-utils` module with an environment variable export for a common directory where we'll place our modules in the future. This directory is (by default) in the `$env.NU_LIB_DIRS` search path discussed in [Using Modules - Module Path](./using_modules.md#module-path).

    ```nu
    # A collection of helpful utility functions

    export use ./increment.nu
    export use ./range-into-list.nu

    export-env {
        $env.NU_MODULES_DIR = ($nu.default-config-dir | path join "scripts")
    }
    ```

    When this module is imported with `use`, the code inside the [`export-env`](/commands/docs/export-env.md) block is run and the its environment merged into the current scope:

    ```nu
    use my-utils
    $env.NU_MODULES_DIR
    # => Returns the directory name
    cd $env.NU_MODULES_DIR
    ```

    ::: tip
    As with any command defined without `--env`, commands and other definitions in the module use their own scope for environment. This allows changes to be made internal to the module without them bleeding into the user's scope. Add the following to the bottom of `my-utils/mod.nu`:

    ```nu
    export def examine-config-dir [] {
        # Changes the PWD environment variable
        cd $nu.default-config-dir
        ls
    }
    ```

    Running this command changes the directory _locally_ in the module, but the changes are not propagated to the parent scope.

    :::

    ## Caveats

    ### `export-env` runs only when the `use` call is _evaluated_

    ::: note
    This scenario is commonly encountered when creating a module that uses `std/log`.
    :::

    Attempting to import a module's environment within another environment may not work as expected. Let's create a new module `go.nu` that creates "shortcuts" to common directories. One of these will be the `$env.NU_MODULES_DIR` defined above in `my-utils`.

    We might try:

    ```nu
    # go.nu, in the parent directory of my-utils
    use my-utils

    export def --env home [] {
        cd ~
    }

    export def --env modules [] {
        cd $env.NU_MODULES_DIR
    }
    ```

    And then import it:

    ```nu
    use go.nu
    go home
    # => Works
    go modules
    # => Error: $env.NU_MODULES_DIR is not found
    ```

    This doesn't work because `my-utils` isn't _evaluated_ in this case; it is only _parsed_ when the `go.nu` module is imported. While this brings all of the other exports into scope, it does not _run_ the `export-env` block.

    ::: important
    As mentioned at the start of this chapter, trying this while `my-utils` (and its `$env.NU_MODULES_DIR`) is still in scope from a previous import will _not_ fail as expected. Test in a new shell session to see the "normal" failure.
    :::

    To bring `my-utils` exported environment into scope for the `go.nu` module, there are two options:

    1. Import the module in each command where it is needed

       By placing `use my-utils` in the `go home` command itself, its `export-env` will be _evaludated_ when the command is. For example:

       ```nu
       # go.nu
       export def --env home [] {
           cd ~
       }

       export def --env modules [] {
           use my-utils
           cd $env.NU_MODULES_DIR
       }
       ```

    2. Import the `my-utils` environment inside an `export-env` block in the `go.nu` module

       ```nu
       use my-utils
       export-env {
           use my-utils []
       }

       export def --env home [] {
           cd ~
       }

       export def --env modules [] {
           cd $env.NU_MODULES_DIR
       }
       ```

       In the example above, `go.nu` imports `my-utils` twice:

       1. The first `use my-utils` imports the module and its definitions (except for the environment) into the module scope.
       2. The second `use my-utils []` imports nothing _but_ the environment into `go.nu`'s exported environment block. Because the `export-env` of `go.nu` is executed when the module is first imported, the `use my-utils []` is also evaluated.

    Note that the first method keeps `my-utils` environment inside the `go.nu` module's scope. The second, on the other hand, re-exports `my-utils` environment into the user scope.

    ### Module files and commands cannot be named after parent module

    A `.nu` file cannot have the same name as its module directory (e.g., `spam/spam.nu`) as this would create an ambiguous condition with the name being defined twice. This is similar to the situation described above where a command cannot have the same name as its parent.

    ## Windows Path Syntax

    ::: important
    Nushell on Windows supports both forward-slashes and back-slashes as the path separator. However, to ensure that they work on all platforms, using only the forward-slash `/` in your modules is highly recommended.
    :::

    ## Additional Examples

    ### Local Definitions

    As mentioned above, definitions in a module without the [`export`](/commands/docs/export.md) keyword are only accessible in the module's scope.

    To demonstrate, create a new module `is-alphanumeric.nu`. Inside this module, we'll create a `str is-alphanumeric` command. If any of the characters in the string are not alpha-numeric, it returns `false`:

    ```nu
    # is-alphanumeric.nu
    def alpha-num-range [] {
        [
            ...(seq char 'a' 'z')
            ...(seq char 'A' 'Z')
            ...(seq 0 9 | each { into string })
        ]
    }

    export def "str is-alphanumeric" []: string -> bool {
        if ($in == '') {
            false
        } else {
            let chars = (split chars)
            $chars | all {|char| $char in (alpha-num-range)}
        }
    }
    ```

    Notice that we have two definitions in this module -- `alpha-num-range` and `str is-alphanumeric`, but only the second is exported.

    ```nu
    use is-alphanumeric.nu *
    'Word' | str is-alphanumeric
    # => true
    'Some punctuation?!' | str is-alphanumeric
    # => false
    'a' in (alpha-num-range)
    # => Error:
    # => help: `alpha-num-range` is neither a Nushell built-in or a known external command
    ```

    ### Selective Export from a Submodule

    ::: note
    While the following is a rare use-case, this technique is used by the Standard Library to
    make the `dirs` commands and its aliases available separately.
    :::

    As mentioned in the [Submodules](#submodules) section above, only `export use` can selectively export definitions from a submodule.

    To demonstrate, let's add a modified form of the `go.nu` module example [above](#caveats) to `my-utils`:

    ```nu
    # go.nu, in the my-utils directory
    export def --env home [] {
        cd ~
    }

    export def --env modules [] {
        cd ($nu.default-config-dir | path join "scripts")
    }

    export alias h = home
    export alias m = modules
    ```

    This `go.nu` includes the following changes from the original:

    - It doesn't rely on the `my-utils` mod since it will now be a submodule of `my-utils` instead
    - It adds "shortcut" aliases:
      `h`: Goes to the home directory (alias of `go home`)
      `m`: Goes to the modules directory (alias of `go modules`)

    A user could import _just_ the aliases with:

    ```nu
    use my-utils/go.nu [h, m]
    ```

    However, let's say we want to have `go.nu` be a submodule of `my-utils`. When a user imports `my-utils`, they should _only_ get the commands, but not the aliases. Edit `my-utils/mod.nu` and add:

    ```nu
    export use ./go.nu [home, modules]
    ```

    That _almost_ works -- It selectively exports `home` and `modules`, but not the aliases. However, it does so without the `go` prefix. For example:

    ```nu
    use my-utils *
    home
    # => works
    go home
    # => Error: command not found
    ```

    To export them as `go home` and `go modules`, make the following change to `my-utils/mod.nu`:

    ```nu
    # Replace the existing `export use` with ...
    export module go {
        export use ./go.nu [home, modules]
    }
    ```

    This creates a new, exported submodule `go` in `my-utils` with the selectively (re)exported definitions for `go home` and `go modules`.

    ```nu
    use my-utils *
    # => As expected:
    go home
    # => works
    home
    # => Error: command not found
    ```

    # Installing Nu

    There are lots of ways to get Nu up and running. You can download pre-built binaries from our [release page](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases), [use your favourite package manager](https://repology.org/project/nushell/versions), or build from source.

    The main Nushell binary is named `nu` (or `nu.exe` on Windows). After installation, you can launch it by typing `nu`.

    @[code](@snippets/installation/run_nu.sh)

    [[toc]]

    ## Pre-built Binaries

    Nu binaries are published for Linux, macOS, and Windows [with each GitHub release](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases). Just download, extract the binaries, then copy them to a location on your PATH.

    ## Package Managers

    Nu is available via several package managers:

    [![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/nushell.svg)](https://repology.org/project/nushell/versions)

    For macOS and Linux, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a popular choice (`brew install nushell`).

    For Windows:

    - [Winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) (`winget install nushell`)
    - [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (`choco install nushell`)
    - [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) (`scoop install nu`)

    For Debian & Ubuntu:

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://apt.fury.io/nushell/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/fury-nushell.gpg
    echo "deb https://apt.fury.io/nushell/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fury.list
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nushell
    ```

    For RedHat/Fedora & Rocky Linux:

    ```sh
    echo "[gemfury-nushell]
    name=Gemfury Nushell Repo
    baseurl=https://yum.fury.io/nushell/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    gpgkey=https://yum.fury.io/nushell/gpg.key" | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/fury-nushell.repo
    sudo dnf install -y nushell
    ```

    For Alpine Linux:

    ```sh
    echo "https://alpine.fury.io/nushell/" | tee -a /etc/apk/repositories
    apk update
    apk add --allow-untrusted nushell
    ```

    Cross Platform installation:

    - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (`npm install -g nushell` Note that nu plugins are not included if you install in this way)

    ## Docker Container Images

    Docker images are available from the GitHub Container Registry. An image for the latest release is built regularly
    for Alpine and Debian. You can run the image in interactive mode using:

    ```nu
    docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/nushell/nushell:<version>-<distro>
    ```

    Where `<version>` is the version of Nushell you want to run and `<distro>` is `alpine` or the latest supported Debian release, such as `bookworm`.

    To run a specific command, use:

    ```nu
    docker run --rm ghcr.io/nushell/nushell:latest-alpine -c "ls /usr/bin | where size > 10KiB"
    ```

    To run a script from the current directory using Bash, use:

    ```nu
    docker run --rm \
        -v $(pwd):/work \
        ghcr.io/nushell/nushell:latest-alpine \
        "/work/script.nu"
    ```

    ## Build from Source

    You can also build Nu from source. First, you will need to set up the Rust toolchain and its dependencies.

    ### Installing a Compiler Suite

    For Rust to work properly, you'll need to have a compatible compiler suite installed on your system. These are the recommended compiler suites:

    - Linux: GCC or Clang
    - macOS: Clang (install Xcode)
    - Windows: MSVC (install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) or the [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022))
      - Make sure to install the "Desktop development with C++" workload
      - Any Visual Studio edition will work (Community is free)

    ### Installing Rust

    If you don't already have Rust on our system, the best way to install it is via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Rustup is a way of managing Rust installations, including managing using different Rust versions.

    Nu currently requires the **latest stable (1.66.1 or later)** version of Rust. The best way is to let `rustup` find the correct version for you. When you first open `rustup` it will ask what version of Rust you wish to install:

    @[code](@snippets/installation/rustup_choose_rust_version.sh)

    Once you are ready, press 1 and then enter.

    If you'd rather not install Rust via `rustup`, you can also install it via other methods (e.g. from a package in a Linux distro). Just be sure to install a version of Rust that is 1.66.1 or later.

    ### Dependencies

    #### Debian/Ubuntu

    You will need to install the "pkg-config", "build-essential" and "libssl-dev" packages:

    @[code](@snippets/installation/install_pkg_config_libssl_dev.sh)

    #### RHEL based distros

    You will need to install "libxcb", "openssl-devel" and "libX11-devel":

    @[code](@snippets/installation/install_rhel_dependencies.sh)

    #### macOS

    ##### Homebrew

    Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you will need to install "openssl" and "cmake" using:

    @[code](@snippets/installation/macos_deps.sh)

    ##### Nix

    If using [Nix](https://nixos.org/download/#nix-install-macos) for package management on macOS, the `openssl`, `cmake`, `pkg-config`, and `curl` packages are required. These can be installed:

    - Globally, using `nix-env --install` (and others).
    - Locally, using [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) in your `home.nix` config.
    - Temporarily, using `nix-shell` (and others).

    ### Build from [crates.io](https://crates.io) using Cargo

    Nushell releases are published as source to the popular Rust package registry [crates.io](https://crates.io/). This makes it easy to build and install the latest Nu release with `cargo`:

    ```nu
    cargo install nu --locked
    ```

    The `cargo` tool will do the work of downloading Nu and its source dependencies, building it, and installing it into the cargo bin path.

    Note that the default plugins must be installed separately when using `cargo`. See the [Plugins Installation](./plugins.html#core-plugins) section of the Book for instructions.

    ### Building from the GitHub repository

    You can also build Nu from the latest source on GitHub. This gives you immediate access to the latest features and bug fixes. First, clone the repo:

    @[code](@snippets/installation/git_clone_nu.sh)

    From there, we can build and run Nu with:

    @[code](@snippets/installation/build_nu_from_source.sh)

    You can also build and run Nu in release mode, which enables more optimizations:

    @[code](@snippets/installation/build_nu_from_source_release.sh)

    People familiar with Rust may wonder why we do both a "build" and a "run" step if "run" does a build by default. This is to get around a shortcoming of the new `default-run` option in Cargo, and ensure that all plugins are built, though this may not be required in the future.

- prompt: |-
    You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the `working_with_lists page of the documentation provided by Nushell`.



    Documentation text:

    # Working with Lists

    :::tip
    Lists are equivalent to the individual columns of tables. You can think of a list as essentially being a "one-column table" (with no column name). Thus, any command which operates on a column _also_ operates on a list. For instance, [`where`](/commands/docs/where.md) can be used with lists:

    ```nu
    [bell book candle] | where ($it =~ 'b')
    # => ╭───┬──────╮
    # => │ 0 │ bell │
    # => │ 1 │ book │
    # => ╰───┴──────╯
    ```

    :::

    ## Creating lists

    A list is an ordered collection of values.
    A list is created using square brackets surrounding values separated by spaces, linebreaks, and/or commas.
    For example, `[foo bar baz]` or `[foo, bar, baz]`.

    ::: tip
    Nushell lists are similar to JSON arrays. The same `[ "Item1", "Item2", "Item3" ]` that represents a JSON array can also be used to create a Nushell list.
    :::

    ## Updating lists

    We can [`insert`](/commands/docs/insert.md) values into lists as they flow through the pipeline, for example let's insert the value `10` into the middle of a list:

    ```nu
    [1, 2, 3, 4] | insert 2 10
    # => [1, 2, 10, 3, 4]
    ```

    We can also use [`update`](/commands/docs/update.md) to replace the 2nd element with the value `10`.

    ```nu
    [1, 2, 3, 4] | update 1 10
    # => [1, 10, 3, 4]
    ```

    ## Removing or Adding Items from List

    In addition to [`insert`](/commands/docs/insert.md) and [`update`](/commands/docs/update.md), we also have [`prepend`](/commands/docs/prepend.md) and [`append`](/commands/docs/append.md). These let you insert to the beginning of a list or at the end of the list, respectively.

    For example:

    ```nu
    let colors = [yellow green]
    let colors = ($colors | prepend red)
    let colors = ($colors | append purple)
    let colors = ($colors ++ ["blue"])
    let colors = (["black"] ++ $colors)
    $colors
    # => [black red yellow green purple blue]
    ```

    In case you want to remove items from list, there are many ways. [`skip`](/commands/docs/skip.md) allows you skip first rows from input, while [`drop`](/commands/docs/drop.md) allows you to skip specific numbered rows from end of list.

    ```nu
    let colors = [red yellow green purple]
    let colors = ($colors | skip 1)
    let colors = ($colors | drop 2)
    $colors
    # => [yellow]
    ```

    We also have [`last`](/commands/docs/last.md) and [`first`](/commands/docs/first.md) which allow you to [`take`](/commands/docs/take.md) from the end or beginning of the list, respectively.

    ```nu
    let colors = [red yellow green purple black magenta]
    let colors = ($colors | last 3)
    $colors
    # => [purple black magenta]
    ```

    And from the beginning of a list,

    ```nu
    let colors = [yellow green purple]
    let colors = ($colors | first 2)
    $colors
    # => [yellow green]
    ```

    ### Using the Spread Operator

    To append one or more lists together, optionally with values interspersed in between, you can also use the
    [spread operator](/book/operators#spread-operator) (`...`):

    ```nu
    let x = [1 2]
    [
      ...$x
      3
      ...(4..7 | take 2)
    ]
    # => ╭───┬───╮
    # => │ 0 │ 1 │
    # => │ 1 │ 2 │
    # => │ 2 │ 3 │
    # => │ 3 │ 4 │
    # => │ 4 │ 5 │
    # => ╰───┴───╯
    ```

    ## Iterating over Lists

    To iterate over the items in a list, use the [`each`](/commands/docs/each.md) command with a [block](types_of_data.html#blocks)
    of Nu code that specifies what to do to each item. The block parameter (e.g. `|elt|` in `{ |elt| print $elt }`) is the current list
    item, but the [`enumerate`](/commands/docs/enumerate.md) filter can be used to provide `index` and `item` values if needed. For example:

    ```nu
    let names = [Mark Tami Amanda Jeremy]
    $names | each { |elt| $"Hello, ($elt)!" }
    # Outputs "Hello, Mark!" and three more similar lines.

    $names | enumerate | each { |elt| $"($elt.index + 1) - ($elt.item)" }
    # Outputs "1 - Mark", "2 - Tami", etc.
    ```

    The [`where`](/commands/docs/where.md) command can be used to create a subset of a list, effectively filtering the list based on a condition.

    The following example gets all the colors whose names end in "e".

    ```nu
    let colors = [red orange yellow green blue purple]
    $colors | where ($it | str ends-with 'e')
    # The block passed to `where` must evaluate to a boolean.
    # This outputs the list [orange blue purple].
    ```

    In this example, we keep only values higher than `7`.

    ```nu
    let scores = [7 10 8 6 7]
    $scores | where $it > 7 # [10 8]
    ```

    The [`reduce`](/commands/docs/reduce.md) command computes a single value from a list.
    It uses a block which takes 2 parameters: the current item (conventionally named `elt`) and an accumulator
    (conventionally named `acc`). To specify an initial value for the accumulator, use the `--fold` (`-f`) flag.
    To change `elt` to have `index` and `item` values, use the [`enumerate`](/commands/docs/enumerate.md) filter.
    For example:

    ```nu
    let scores = [3 8 4]
    $"total = ($scores | reduce { |elt, acc| $acc + $elt })" # total = 15

    $"total = ($scores | math sum)" # easier approach, same result

    $"product = ($scores | reduce --fold 1 { |elt, acc| $acc * $elt })" # product = 96

    $scores | enumerate | reduce --fold 0 { |elt, acc| $acc + $elt.index * $elt.item } # 0*3 + 1*8 + 2*4 = 16
    ```

    ## Accessing the List

    ::: tip Note
    The following is a basic overview. For a more in-depth discussion of this topic, see the chapter, [Navigating and Accessing Structured Data](/book/navigating_structured_data.md).
    :::

    To access a list item at a given index, use the `$name.index` form where `$name` is a variable that holds a list.

    For example, the second element in the list below can be accessed with `$names.1`.

    ```nu
    let names = [Mark Tami Amanda Jeremy]
    $names.1 # gives Tami
    ```

    If the index is in some variable `$index` we can use the `get` command to extract the item from the list.

    ```nu
    let names = [Mark Tami Amanda Jeremy]
    let index = 1
    $names | get $index # gives Tami
    ```

    The [`length`](/commands/docs/length.md) command returns the number of items in a list.
    For example, `[red green blue] | length` outputs `3`.

    The [`is-empty`](/commands/docs/is-empty.md) command determines whether a string, list, or table is empty.
    It can be used with lists as follows:

    ```nu
    let colors = [red green blue]
    $colors | is-empty # false

    let colors = []
    $colors | is-empty # true
    ```

    The `in` and `not-in` operators are used to test whether a value is in a list. For example:

    ```nu
    let colors = [red green blue]
    'blue' in $colors # true
    'yellow' in $colors # false
    'gold' not-in $colors # true
    ```

    The [`any`](/commands/docs/any.md) command determines if any item in a list
    matches a given condition.
    For example:

    ```nu
    let colors = [red green blue]
    # Do any color names end with "e"?
    $colors | any {|elt| $elt | str ends-with "e" } # true

    # Is the length of any color name less than 3?
    $colors | any {|elt| ($elt | str length) < 3 } # false

    let scores = [3 8 4]
    # Are any scores greater than 7?
    $scores | any {|elt| $elt > 7 } # true

    # Are any scores odd?
    $scores | any {|elt| $elt mod 2 == 1 } # true
    ```

    The [`all`](/commands/docs/all.md) command determines if every item in a list
    matches a given condition.
    For example:

    ```nu
    let colors = [red green blue]
    # Do all color names end with "e"?
    $colors | all {|elt| $elt | str ends-with "e" } # false

    # Is the length of all color names greater than or equal to 3?
    $colors | all {|elt| ($elt | str length) >= 3 } # true

    let scores = [3 8 4]
    # Are all scores greater than 7?
    $scores | all {|elt| $elt > 7 } # false

    # Are all scores even?
    $scores | all {|elt| $elt mod 2 == 0 } # false
    ```

    ## Converting the List

    The [`flatten`](/commands/docs/flatten.md) command creates a new list from an existing list
    by adding items in nested lists to the top-level list.
    This can be called multiple times to flatten lists nested at any depth.
    For example:

    ```nu
    [1 [2 3] 4 [5 6]] | flatten # [1 2 3 4 5 6]

    [[1 2] [3 [4 5 [6 7 8]]]] | flatten | flatten | flatten # [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]
    ```

    The [`wrap`](/commands/docs/wrap.md) command converts a list to a table. Each list value will
    be converted to a separate row with a single column:

    ```nu
    let zones = [UTC CET Europe/Moscow Asia/Yekaterinburg]

    # Show world clock for selected time zones
    $zones | wrap 'Zone' | upsert Time {|row| (date now | date to-timezone $row.Zone | format date '%Y.%m.%d %H:%M')}
    ```

Shadowing means that they are redeclared and their initial value cannot be used anymore within the same scope.\n\n```nu\nlet val = 42                   # declare a variable\ndo { let val = 101;  $val }    # in an inner scope, shadow the variable\n# => 101\n$val                           # in the outer scope the variable remains unchanged\n# => 42\nlet val = $val + 1             # now, in the outer scope, shadow the original variable\n$val                           # in the outer scope, the variable is now shadowed, and\n# => 43                               # its original value is no longer available.\n```\n\n### Mutable Variables\n\nA mutable variable is allowed to change its value by assignment. These are declared using the `mut` keyword.\n\n```nu\nmut val = 42\n$val += 27\n$val\n# => 69\n```\n\nThere are a couple of assignment operators used with mutable variables\n\n| Operator | Description                                                                |\n| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `=`      | Assigns a new value to the variable                                        |\n| `+=`     | Adds a value to the variable and makes the sum its new value               |\n| `-=`     | Subtracts a value from the variable and makes the difference its new value |\n| `*=`     | Multiplies the variable by a value and makes the product its new value     |\n| `/=`     | Divides the variable by a value and makes the quotient its new value       |\n| `++=`    | Appends a list or a value to a variable                                    |\n\n::: tip Note\n\n1. `+=`, `-=`, `*=` and `/=` are only valid in the contexts where their root operations are expected to work. For example, `+=` uses addition, so it can not be used for contexts where addition would normally fail\n2. `++=` requires that either the variable **or** the argument is a list.\n   :::\n\n#### More on Mutability\n\nClosures and nested `def`s cannot capture mutable variables from their environment. For example\n\n```nu\n# naive method to count number of elements in a list\nmut x = 0\n\n[1 2 3] | each { $x += 1 }   # error: $x is captured in a closure\n```\n\nTo use mutable variables for such behaviour, you are encouraged to use the loops\n\n### Constant Variables\n\nA constant variable is an immutable variable that can be fully evaluated at parse-time. These are useful with commands that need to know the value of an argument at parse time, like [`source`](/commands/docs/source.md), [`use`](/commands/docs/use.md) and [`plugin use`](/commands/docs/plugin_use.md). See [how nushell code gets run](how_nushell_code_gets_run.md) for a deeper explanation. They are declared using the `const` keyword\n\n```nu\nconst script_file = 'path/to/script.nu'\nsource $script_file\n```\n\n## Choosing between mutable and immutable variables\n\nTry to use immutable variables for most use-cases.\n\nYou might wonder why Nushell uses immutable variables by default. For the first few years of Nushell's development, mutable variables were not a language feature. Early on in Nushell's development, we decided to see how long we could go using a more data-focused, functional style in the language. This experiment showed its value when Nushell introduced parallelism. By switching from [`each`](/commands/docs/each.md) to [`par-each`](/commands/docs/par-each.md) in any Nushell script, you're able to run the corresponding block of code in parallel over the input. This is possible because Nushell's design leans heavily on immutability, composition, and pipelining.\n\nMany, if not most, use-cases for mutable variables in Nushell have a functional solution that:\n\n- Only uses immutable variables, and as a result ...\n- Has better performance\n- Supports streaming\n- Can support additional features such as `par-each` as mentioned above\n\nFor instance, loop counters are a common pattern for mutable variables and are built into most iterating commands. For example, you can get both each item and the index of each item using [`each`](/commands/docs/each.md) with [`enumerate`](/commands/docs/enumerate.md):\n\n```nu\nls | enumerate | each { |elt| $\"Item #($elt.index) is size ($elt.item.size)\" }\n# => ╭───┬───────────────────────────╮\n# => │ 0 │ Item #0 is size 812 B     │\n# => │ 1 │ Item #1 is size 3.4 KiB   │\n# => │ 2 │ Item #2 is size 11.0 KiB  │\n# => │ 3 │ ...                       │\n# => │ 4 │ Item #18 is size 17.8 KiB │\n# => │ 5 │ Item #19 is size 482 B    │\n# => │ 6 │ Item #20 is size 4.0 KiB  │\n# => ╰───┴───────────────────────────╯\n```\n\nYou can also use the [`reduce`](/commands/docs/reduce.md) command to work in the same way you might mutate a variable in a loop. For example, if you wanted to find the largest string in a list of strings, you might do:\n\n```nu\n[one, two, three, four, five, six] | reduce {|current_item, max|\n  if ($current_item | str length) > ($max | str length) {\n      $current_item\n  } else {\n      $max\n  }\n}\n\nthree\n```\n\nWhile `reduce` processes lists, the [`generate`](/commands/docs/generate.md) command can be used with arbitrary sources such as external REST APIs, also without requiring mutable variables. Here's an example that retrieves local weather data every hour and generates a continuous list from that data. The `each` command can be used to consume each new list item as it becomes available.\n\n```nu\ngenerate khot {|weather_station|\n  let res = try {\n    http get -ef $'https://api.weather.gov/stations/($weather_station)/observations/latest'\n  } catch {\n    null\n  }\n  sleep 1hr\n  match $res {\n    null => {\n      next: $weather_station\n    }\n    _ => {\n      out: ($res.body? | default '' | from json)\n      next: $weather_station\n    }\n  }\n}\n| each {|weather_report|\n    {\n      time: ($weather_report.properties.timestamp | into datetime)\n      temp: $weather_report.properties.temperature.value\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\nUsing [filter commands](/commands/categories/filters.html) with immutable variables is often far more performant than mutable variables with traditional flow-control statements such as `for` and `while`. For example:\n\n- Using a `for` statement to create a list of 50,000 random numbers:\n\n  ```nu\n  timeit {\n    mut randoms = []\n    for _ in 1..50_000 {\n      $randoms = ($randoms | append (random int))\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Result: 1min 4sec 191ms 135µs 90ns\n\n- Using `each` to do the same:\n\n  ```nu\n  timeit {\n    let randoms = (1..50_000 | each {random int})\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Result: 19ms 314µs 205ns\n\n- Using `each` with 10,000,000 iterations:\n\n  ```nu\n  timeit {\n    let randoms = (1..10_000_000 | each {random int})\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Result: 4sec 233ms 865µs 238ns\n\n  As with many filters, the `each` statement also streams its results, meaning the next stage of the pipeline can continue processing without waiting for the results to be collected into a variable.\n\n  For tasks which can be optimized by parallelization, as mentioned above, `par-each` can have even more drastic performance gains.\n\n## Variable Names\n\nVariable names in Nushell come with a few restrictions as to what characters they can contain. In particular, they cannot contain these characters:\n\n```text\n.  [  (  {  +  -  *  ^  /  =  !  <  >  &  |\n```\n\nIt is common for some scripts to declare variables that start with `$`. This is allowed, and it is equivalent to the `$` not being there at all.\n\n```nu\nlet $var = 42\n# identical to `let var = 42`\n```"

    Documentation text:

    # Externs

    Using external commands (a.k.a. binaries or applications) is a fundamental feature of any shell. Nushell allows custom commands to take advantage of many of its features, such as:

    - Parse-time type checking
    - Completions
    - Syntax highlighting

    Support for these features is provided using the `extern` keyword, which allows a full signature to be defined for external commands.

    Here's a short example for the `ssh` command:

    ```nu
    module "ssh extern" {
      def complete_none [] { [] }

      def complete_ssh_identity [] {
        ls ~/.ssh/id_*
        | where {|f|
            ($f.name | path parse | get extension) != "pub"
          }
        | get name
      }

      export extern ssh [
        destination?: string@complete_none  # Destination Host
        -p: int                             # Destination Port
        -i: string@complete_ssh_identity    # Identity File
      ]
    }
    use "ssh extern" ssh
    ```

    Notice that the syntax here is similar to that of the `def` keyword when defining a custom command. You can describe flags, positional parameters, types, completers, and more.

    This implementation:

    - Will provide `-p` and `-i` (with descriptions) as possible completions for `ssh -`.
    - Will perform parse-time type checking. Attempting to use a non-`int` for the port number will result in an error (and error-condition syntax highlighting).
    - Will offer parse-time syntax highlighting based on the shapes of the arguments.
    - Will offer any private key files in `~/.ssh` as completion values for the `-i` (identity) option
    - Will not offer completions for the destination host. Without a completer that returns an empty list, Nushell would attempt to use the default "File" completer.

      See the [Nu_scripts Repository](https://github.com/nushell/nu_scripts/blob/main/custom-completions/ssh/ssh-completions.nu) for an implementation that retrieves hosts from the SSH config files.

    ::: tip Note
    A Nushell comment that continues on the same line for argument documentation purposes requires a space before the ` #` pound sign.
    :::

    ## Format Specifiers

    Positional parameters can be made optional with a `?` (as seen above). The remaining (`rest`) parameters can be matched with `...` before the parameter name. For example:

    ```nu
    export extern "git add" [
      ...pathspecs: path
      # …
    ]
    ```

    ## Limitations

    There are a few limitations to the current `extern` syntax. In Nushell, flags and positional arguments are very flexible—flags can precede positional arguments, flags can be mixed into positional arguments, and flags can follow positional arguments. Many external commands are not this flexible. There is not yet a way to require a particular ordering of flags and positional arguments to the style required by the external.

    The second limitation is that some externals require flags to be passed using `=` to separate the flag and the value. In Nushell, the `=` is a convenient optional syntax and there's currently no way to require its use.

    In addition, externals called via the caret sigil (e.g., `^ssh`) are not recognized by `extern`.

    Finally, some external commands support `-long` arguments using a single leading hyphen. Nushell `extern` syntax can not yet represent these arguments.

    Documentation text:

    # Programming in Nu

    This chapter goes into more detail of Nushell as a programming language.
    Each major language feature has its own section.

    Just like most programming languages allow you to define functions, Nushell uses [custom commands](custom_commands.md) for this purpose.

    From other shells you might be used to [aliases](aliases.md).
    Nushell's aliases work in a similar way and are a part of the programming language, not just a shell feature.

    Common operations, such as addition or regex search, can be done with [operators](operators.md).
    Not all operations are supported for all data types, and Nushell will make sure to let you know when there is a mismatch.

    You can store intermediate results to [variables](variables.md).
    Variables can be immutable, mutable, or a parse-time constant.

    The last three sections are aimed at organizing your code:

    [Scripts](scripts.md) are the simplest form of code organization: You just put the code into a file and source it.
    However, you can also run scripts as standalone programs with command line signatures using the "special" `main` command.

    With [modules](modules.md), just like in many other programming languages, it is possible to compose your code from smaller pieces.
    Modules let you define a public interface vs. private commands and you can import custom commands, aliases, and environment variables from them.

    [Overlays](overlays.md) build on top of modules.
    By defining an overlay, you bring in module's definitions into its own swappable "layer" that gets applied on top of other overlays.
    This enables features like activating virtual environments or overriding sets of default commands with custom variants.

    The standard library also has a [testing framework](testing.md) if you want to prove your reusable code works perfectly.

    ## Examples

    Insert a new entry into a single record
    ```nu
    > {'name': 'nu', 'stars': 5} | insert alias 'Nushell'
    ╭───────┬─────────╮
    │ name  │ nu      │
    │ stars │ 5       │

    ```

    Insert a new column with values computed based off the other columns
    ```nu
    > [[foo]; [7] [8] [9]] | insert bar {|row| $row.foo * 2 }
    ╭───┬─────┬─────╮
    │ # │ foo │ bar │
    ├───┼─────┼─────┤
    │ 0 │   7 │  14 │

    Insert a new value into a list at an index
    ```nu
    > [1 2 4] | insert 2 3
    ╭───┬───╮
    │ 0 │ 1 │
    │ 1 │ 2 │
    │ 2 │ 3 │
    │ 3 │ 4 │
    ╰───┴───╯

    ```

    Insert a new value at the end of a list
    ```nu
    > [1 2 3] | insert 3 4
    ╭───┬───╮

    │   │ ╰───┴───────╯ │
    ╰───┴───────────────╯

    ```

    ## Notes
    When inserting a column, the closure will be run for each row, and the current row will be passed as the first argument.
    When inserting into a specific index, the closure will instead get the current value at the index or null if inserting at the end of a list/table.

    ## Notes
    Print the given query, and read the immediate result from stdin.

    The standard input will be read right after `query` is printed, and consumed until the `terminator`
    sequence is encountered. The `terminator` is not included in the output.

    If `terminator` is not supplied, input will be read until Ctrl-C is pressed.

    If `prefix` is supplied, input's initial bytes will be validated against it.

    <div class='command-title'>Print the given values to stdout.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> print {flags} ...rest```

    ## Flags

     -  `--no-newline, -n`: print without inserting a newline for the line ending
     -  `--stderr, -e`: print to stderr instead of stdout
     -  `--raw, -r`: print without formatting (including binary data)

    ## Parameters

     -  `...rest`: the values to print


    ## Input/output types:

    | input   | output  |
    | ------- | ------- |
    | any     | nothing |
    | nothing | nothing |
    ## Examples

    Print 'hello world'

    > print (2 + 3)

    ```

    Print 'ABC' from binary data
    ```nu
    > 0x[41 42 43] | print --raw

    ```

    ## Notes
    Unlike `echo`, this command does not return any value (`print | describe` will return "nothing").
    Since this command has no output, there is no point in piping it with other commands.

    `print` may be used inside blocks of code (e.g.: hooks) to display text during execution without interfering with the pipeline.

    ```

    Filter items of a range according to a condition
    ```nu
    > 9..13 | filter {|el| $el mod 2 != 0}
    ╭───┬────╮
    │ 0 │  9 │
    │ 1 │ 11 │
    │ 2 │ 13 │
    ╰───┴────╯

    ```

    List all numbers above 3, using an existing closure condition
    ```nu
    > let a = {$in > 3}; [1, 2, 5, 6] | filter $a

    ```

    ## Notes
    This command works similar to 'where' but allows reading the predicate closure from
    a variable. On the other hand, the "row condition" syntax is not supported.

    <div class='command-title'>Convert special record structure into .xml text.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> to xml {flags} ```

    ## Flags

     -  `--indent, -i {int}`: Formats the XML text with the provided indentation setting
     -  `--partial-escape, -p`: Only escape mandatory characters in text and attributes
     -  `--self-closed, -s`: Output empty tags as self closing


    ## Input/output types:

    | input  | output |
    | ------ | ------ |
    | record | string |
    ## Examples

    Outputs an XML string representing the contents of this table
    ```nu
    > {tag: note attributes: {} content : [{tag: remember attributes: {} content : [{tag: null attributes: null content : Event}]}]} | to xml
    <note><remember>Event</remember></note>
    ```

    When formatting xml null and empty record fields can be omitted and strings can be written without a wrapping record
    ```nu
    > {tag: note content : [{tag: remember content : [Event]}]} | to xml
    <note><remember>Event</remember></note>
    ```

    Optionally, formats the text with a custom indentation setting
    ```nu
    > {tag: note content : [{tag: remember content : [Event]}]} | to xml --indent 3
    <note>
       <remember>Event</remember>
    </note>
    ```

    Produce less escaping sequences in resulting xml
    ```nu
    > {tag: note attributes: {a: "'qwe'\\"} content: ["\"'"]} | to xml --partial-escape
    <note a="'qwe'\">"'</note>
    ```

    Save space using self-closed tags
    ```nu
    > {tag: root content: [[tag]; [a] [b] [c]]} | to xml --self-closed
    <root><a/><b/><c/></root>
    ```

    ## Notes
    Every XML entry is represented via a record with tag, attribute and content fields.
    To represent different types of entries different values must be written to this fields:
    1. Tag entry: `{tag: <tag name> attributes: {<attr name>: "<string value>" ...} content: [<entries>]}`
    2. Comment entry: `{tag: '!' attributes: null content: "<comment string>"}`
    3. Processing instruction (PI): `{tag: '?<pi name>' attributes: null content: "<pi content string>"}`
    4. Text: `{tag: null attributes: null content: "<text>"}`. Or as plain `<text>` instead of record.

    Additionally any field which is: empty record, empty list or null, can be omitted.

    ## Notes
    Not all values are representable as MessagePack.

    The datetime extension type is used for dates. Binaries are represented with
    the native MessagePack binary type. Most other types are represented in an
    analogous way to `to json`, and may not convert to the exact same type when
    deserialized with `from msgpack`.

    MessagePack: https://msgpack.org/
  documentationQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the `to msgpack` command in Nushell as described in the documentation?
  documentationQuestion2: How can a user convert a table into MessagePack format using the `to msgpack` command, and what does the output represent?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the effect of using the `--serialize` flag with the `to msgpack` command, and in what scenarios would it be useful?

    # `str expand` for [strings](/commands/categories/strings.md)

    <div class='command-title'>Generates all possible combinations defined in brace expansion syntax.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> str expand {flags} ```

    ## Flags

     -  `--path`: Replaces all backslashes with double backslashes, useful for Path.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input        | output             |
    | ------------ | ------------------ |
    | list\<string\> | list\<list\<string\>\> |
    | string       | list\<string\>       |
    ## Examples

    Define a range inside braces to produce a list of string.
    ```nu
    > "{3..5}" | str expand
    ╭───┬───╮
    │ 0 │ 3 │
    │ 1 │ 4 │
    │ 2 │ 5 │
    ╰───┴───╯

    ```

    Ignore the next character after the backslash ('\')
    ```nu
    > 'A{B\,,C}' | str expand
    ╭───┬─────╮
    │ 0 │ AB, │
    │ 1 │ AC  │
    ╰───┴─────╯

    ```

    Commas that are not inside any braces need to be skipped.
    ```nu
    > 'Welcome\, {home,mon ami}!' | str expand
    ╭───┬───────────────────╮
    │ 0 │ Welcome, home!    │
    │ 1 │ Welcome, mon ami! │
    ╰───┴───────────────────╯

    ```

    Use double backslashes to add a backslash.
    ```nu
    > 'A{B\\,C}' | str expand
    ╭───┬─────╮
    │ 0 │ AB\ │
    │ 1 │ AC  │
    ╰───┴─────╯

    ```

    Export comma separated values inside braces (`{}`) to a string list.
    ```nu
    > "{apple,banana,cherry}" | str expand
    ╭───┬────────╮
    │ 0 │ apple  │
    │ 1 │ banana │
    │ 2 │ cherry │
    ╰───┴────────╯

    ```

    If the piped data is path, you may want to use --path flag, or else manually replace the backslashes with double backslashes.
    ```nu
    > 'C:\{Users,Windows}' | str expand --path
    ╭───┬────────────╮
    │ 0 │ C:\Users   │
    │ 1 │ C:\Windows │
    ╰───┴────────────╯

    ```

    Brace expressions can be used one after another.
    ```nu
    > "A{b,c}D{e,f}G" | str expand
    ╭───┬───────╮
    │ 0 │ AbDeG │
    │ 1 │ AbDfG │
    │ 2 │ AcDeG │
    │ 3 │ AcDfG │
    ╰───┴───────╯

    ```

    Collection may include an empty item. It can be put at the start of the list.
    ```nu
    > "A{,B,C}" | str expand
    ╭───┬────╮
    │ 0 │ A  │
    │ 1 │ AB │
    │ 2 │ AC │
    ╰───┴────╯

    ```

    Empty item can be at the end of the collection.
    ```nu
    > "A{B,C,}" | str expand
    ╭───┬────╮
    │ 0 │ AB │
    │ 1 │ AC │
    │ 2 │ A  │
    ╰───┴────╯

    ```

    Empty item can be in the middle of the collection.
    ```nu
    > "A{B,,C}" | str expand
    ╭───┬────╮
    │ 0 │ AB │
    │ 1 │ A  │
    │ 2 │ AC │
    ╰───┴────╯

    ```

    Also, it is possible to use one inside another. Here is a real-world example, that creates files:
    ```nu
    > "A{B{1,3},C{2,5}}D" | str expand
    ╭───┬──────╮
    │ 0 │ AB1D │
    │ 1 │ AB3D │
    │ 2 │ AC2D │
    │ 3 │ AC5D │
    ╰───┴──────╯

    ```

    Supports zero padding in numeric ranges.
    ```nu
    > "A{08..10}B{11..013}C" | str expand
    ╭───┬──────────╮
    │ 0 │ A08B011C │
    │ 1 │ A08B012C │
    │ 2 │ A08B013C │
    │ 3 │ A09B011C │
    │ 4 │ A09B012C │
    │ 5 │ A09B013C │
    │ 6 │ A10B011C │
    │ 7 │ A10B012C │
    │ 8 │ A10B013C │
    ╰───┴──────────╯

    ```

    ## Notes
    This syntax may seem familiar with `glob {A,B}.C`. The difference is glob relies on filesystem, but str expand is not. Inside braces, we put variants. Then basically we're creating all possible outcomes.

    | nothing | string |
    ## Notes

    You must use one of the subcommands below. Using this command as-is will only produce this help message.

    The following are the main datatypes (wrapped from Polars) that are used by these subcommands:

    Lazy and Strict dataframes (called `NuLazyFrame` and `NuDataFrame` in error messages) are the main
    data structure.

    Expressions, representing various column operations (called `NuExpression`), are passed to many commands such as
    `polars filter` or `polars with-column`. Most nushell operators are supported in these expressions, importantly
    arithmetic, comparison and boolean logical.

    Groupbys (`NuLazyGroupBy`), the output of a `polars group-by`, represent a grouped dataframe and are typically piped
    to the `polars agg` command with some column expressions for aggregation which then returns a dataframe.

    <div class='command-title'>Remove a plugin from the plugin registry file.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> plugin rm {flags} (name)```

    ## Flags

     -  `--plugin-config {path}`: Use a plugin registry file other than the one set in `$nu.plugin-path`
     -  `--force, -f`: Don't cause an error if the plugin name wasn't found in the file

    ## Parameters

     -  `name`: The name, or filename, of the plugin to remove.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input   | output  |
    | ------- | ------- |
    | nothing | nothing |
    ## Examples

    Remove the installed signatures for the `inc` plugin.
    ```nu
    > plugin rm inc

    ```

    Remove the installed signatures for the plugin with the filename `~/.cargo/bin/nu_plugin_inc`.
    ```nu
    > plugin rm ~/.cargo/bin/nu_plugin_inc

    ```

    Remove the installed signatures for the `polars` plugin from the "polars.msgpackz" plugin registry file.
    ```nu
    > plugin rm --plugin-config polars.msgpackz polars

    ```

    ## Notes
    This does not remove the plugin commands from the current scope or from `plugin
    list` in the current shell. It instead removes the plugin from the plugin
    registry file (by default, `$nu.plugin-path`). The changes will be apparent the
    next time `nu` is launched with that plugin registry file.

    This can be useful for removing an invalid plugin signature, if it can't be
    fixed with `plugin add`.

    <div class='command-title'>Merge the input with a record or table, recursively merging values in matching columns.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> merge deep {flags} (value)```

    ## Flags

     -  `--strategy, -s {string}`: The list merging strategy to use. One of: table (default), overwrite, append, prepend

    ## Parameters

     -  `value`: The new value to merge with.


    ## Input/output types:

    ## Examples

    Merge two records recursively
    ```nu
    > {a: 1, b: {c: 2, d: 3}} | merge deep {b: {d: 4, e: 5}}
    ╭───┬───────────╮

    ╰───────┴──────────────────────╯
    ```

    ## Notes
    The way that key-value pairs which exist in both the input and the argument are merged depends on their types.

    Scalar values (like numbers and strings) in the input are overwritten by the corresponding value from the argument.
    Records in the input are merged similarly to the merge command, but recursing rather than overwriting inner records.

    The way lists and tables are merged is controlled by the `--strategy` flag:
      - table: Merges tables element-wise, similarly to the merge command. Non-table lists are overwritten.
      - overwrite: Lists and tables are overwritten with their corresponding value from the argument, similarly to scalars.
      - append: Lists and tables in the input are appended with the corresponding list from the argument.
      - prepend: Lists and tables in the input are prepended with the corresponding list from the argument.

    ## Notes
    Each date/datetime is mapped to the start of its bucket using the corresponding local datetime. Note that weekly buckets start on Monday. Ambiguous results are localised using the DST offset of the original timestamp - for example, truncating '2022-11-06 01:30:00 CST' by '1h' results in '2022-11-06 01:00:00 CST', whereas truncating '2022-11-06 01:30:00 CDT' by '1h' results in '2022-11-06 01:00:00 CDT'.

    ## Notes

    Not all values are representable as MessagePack.

    The datetime extension type is read as dates. MessagePack binary values are
    read to their Nu equivalent. Most other types are read in an analogous way to
    `from json`, and may not convert to the exact same type if `to msgpack` was
    used originally to create the data.

    ## Notes
    Be aware that this command 'unwraps' lists passed to it. So, if you pass a variable to it,
    and you want the variable's contents to be prepended without being unwrapped, it's wise to
    pre-emptively wrap the variable in a list, like so: `prepend [$val]`. This way, `prepend` will
    only unwrap the outer list, and leave the variable's contents untouched.

  documentationQuestion2: How can a user prepend a list of integers [0 1] to an existing list [2 3 4] using the `prepend` command?
  documentationQuestion3: What is a common use case for wrapping a variable in a list before using the `prepend` command, and how does it prevent unintended behavior?

    # `transpose` for [filters](/commands/categories/filters.md)

    <div class='command-title'>Transposes the table contents so rows become columns and columns become rows.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> transpose {flags} ...rest```

    ## Flags

     -  `--header-row, -r`: use the first input column as the table header-row (or keynames when combined with --as-record)
     -  `--ignore-titles, -i`: don't transpose the column names into values
     -  `--as-record, -d`: transfer to record if the result is a table and contains only one row
     -  `--keep-last, -l`: on repetition of record fields due to `header-row`, keep the last value obtained
     -  `--keep-all, -a`: on repetition of record fields due to `header-row`, keep all the values obtained

    ## Parameters

     -  `...rest`: The names to give columns once transposed.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input  | output |
    | ------ | ------ |
    | record | table  |
    | table  | any    |
    ## Examples

    Transposes the table contents with default column names
    ```nu
    > [[c1 c2]; [1 2]] | transpose
    ╭───┬─────────┬─────────╮
    │ # │ column0 │ column1 │

    │ 1 │ c2      │       2 │
    ╰───┴─────────┴─────────╯

    ```

    Transposes the table contents with specified column names
    ```nu
    > [[c1 c2]; [1 2]] | transpose key val
    ╭───┬─────┬─────╮
    │ # │ key │ val │
    ├───┼─────┼─────┤
    │ 0 │ c1  │   1 │
    │ 1 │ c2  │   2 │
    ╰───┴─────┴─────╯

    ```

    Transposes the table without column names and specify a new column name
    ```nu
    > [[c1 c2]; [1 2]] | transpose --ignore-titles val
    ╭───┬─────╮
    │ # │ val │
    ├───┼─────┤
    │ 0 │   1 │
    │ 1 │   2 │
    ╰───┴─────╯

    ```

    Transfer back to record with -d flag
    ```nu
    > {c1: 1, c2: 2} | transpose | transpose --ignore-titles -r -d

    ## Signature

    ```> job send {flags} (id)```

    ## Flags

     -  `--tag {int}`: A tag for the message

    ## Parameters

     -  `id`: The id of the job to send the message to.


    ## Input/output types:

    ## Examples

    Send a message to a newly spawned job
    ```nu
    > let id = job spawn { job recv | save sent.txt }; 'hi' | job send $id

    ```

    ## Notes

    This command sends a message to a background job, which can then read sent messages
    in a first-in-first-out fashion with `job recv`. When it does so, it may additionally specify a numeric filter tag,
    in which case it will only read messages sent with the exact same filter tag.
    In particular, the id 0 refers to the main/initial nushell thread.

    A message can be any nushell value, and streams are always collected before being sent.

    This command never blocks.

    │   │ │ 0 │ value │ │
    │   │ ╰───┴───────╯ │
    ╰───┴───────────────╯

    ```

    ## Notes
    When updating or inserting a column, the closure will be run for each row, and the current row will be passed as the first argument. Referencing `$in` inside the closure will provide the value at the column for the current row or null if the column does not exist.

    When updating a specific index, the closure will instead be run once. The first argument to the closure and the `$in` value will both be the current value at the index. If the command is inserting at the end of a list or table, then both of these values will be null.

    ## Notes
    You must use one of the following subcommands. Using this command as-is will only produce this help message.

    There are three ways to represent a path:

    * As a path literal, e.g., '/home/viking/spam.txt'
    * As a structured path: a table with 'parent', 'stem', and 'extension' (and
    * 'prefix' on Windows) columns. This format is produced by the 'path parse'
      subcommand.
    * As a list of path parts, e.g., '[ / home viking spam.txt ]'. Splitting into
      parts is done by the `path split` command.

    All subcommands accept all three variants as an input. Furthermore, the 'path
    join' subcommand can be used to join the structured path or path parts back into
    the path literal.

    ## Subcommands:

    | name                                                     | description                                                                          | type     |

                  the engine, but is not running.
    - `running`:  The plugin is currently running, and the `pid` column should
                  contain its process ID.
    - `modified`: The plugin state present in the plugin registry file is different
                  from the state in the engine.
    - `removed`:  The plugin is still loaded in the engine, but is not present in
                  the plugin registry file.
    - `invalid`:  The data in the plugin registry file couldn't be deserialized,
                  and the plugin most likely needs to be added again.

    `running` takes priority over any other status. Unless `--registry` is used
    or the plugin has not been loaded yet, the values of `version`, `filename`,
    `shell`, and `commands` reflect the values in the engine and not the ones in
    the plugin registry file.

    # `echo` for [core](/commands/categories/core.md)

    <div class='command-title'>Returns its arguments, ignoring the piped-in value.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> echo {flags} ...rest```

    ## Parameters

     -  `...rest`: The values to echo.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input   | output |
    | ------- | ------ |
    | nothing | any    |
    ## Examples

    Put a list of numbers in the pipeline. This is the same as [1 2 3].
    ```nu
    > echo 1 2 3
    ╭───┬───╮
    │ 0 │ 1 │
    │ 1 │ 2 │
    │ 2 │ 3 │
    ╰───┴───╯

    ```

    Returns the piped-in value, by using the special $in variable to obtain it.
    ```nu
    > echo $in

    ```

    ## Notes
    Unlike `print`, which prints unstructured text to stdout, `echo` is like an
    identity function and simply returns its arguments. When given no arguments,
    it returns an empty string. When given one argument, it returns it as a
    nushell value. Otherwise, it returns a list of the arguments. There is usually
    little reason to use this over just writing the values as-is.

    # `polars as-datetime` for [dataframe](/commands/categories/dataframe.md)

    <div class='command-title'>Converts string to datetime.</div>

    ::: warning This command requires a plugin
    The `polars as-datetime` command resides in the `polars` plugin.
    To use this command, you must install and register `nu_plugin_polars`.
    See the [Plugins](/book/plugins.html) chapter in the book for more information.
    :::


    ## Signature

    ```> polars as-datetime {flags} (format)```

    ## Flags

     -  `--not-exact, -n`: the format string may be contained in the date (e.g. foo-2021-01-01-bar could match 2021-01-01)
     -  `--naive`: the input datetimes should be parsed as naive (i.e., not timezone-aware). Ignored if input is an expression.
     -  `--ambiguous, -a {one_of(string, nothing)}`: Determine how to deal with ambiguous datetimes:
                        `raise` (default): raise error
                        `earliest`: use the earliest datetime
                        `latest`: use the latest datetime
                        `null`: set to null
                        Used only when input is a lazyframe or expression and ignored otherwise

    ## Parameters

     -  `format`: formatting date time string

    ## Notes
    This differs from `get` in that, rather than accessing the given value in the data structure,
    it removes all non-selected values from the structure. Hence, using `select` on a table will
    produce a table, a list will produce a list, and a record will produce a record.

    # `plugin add` for [plugin](/commands/categories/plugin.md)

    <div class='command-title'>Add a plugin to the plugin registry file.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> plugin add {flags} (filename)```

    ## Flags

     -  `--plugin-config {path}`: Use a plugin registry file other than the one set in `$nu.plugin-path`
     -  `--shell, -s {path}`: Use an additional shell program (cmd, sh, python, etc.) to run the plugin

    ## Parameters

     -  `filename`: Path to the executable for the plugin.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input   | output  |
    | ------- | ------- |
    | nothing | nothing |
    ## Examples

    Run the `nu_plugin_inc` plugin from the current directory or $env.NU_PLUGIN_DIRS and install its signatures.
    ```nu
    > plugin add nu_plugin_inc

    ```

    Run the `nu_plugin_polars` plugin from the current directory or $env.NU_PLUGIN_DIRS, and install its signatures to the "polars.msgpackz" plugin registry file.
    ```nu
    > plugin add --plugin-config polars.msgpackz nu_plugin_polars

    ```

    ## Notes
    This does not load the plugin commands into the scope - see `plugin use` for
    that.

    Instead, it runs the plugin to get its command signatures, and then edits the
    plugin registry file (by default, `$nu.plugin-path`). The changes will be
    apparent the next time `nu` is next launched with that plugin registry file.

    ```

    ## Notes
    This command is a parser keyword. For details, check:
      https://www.nushell.sh/book/thinking_in_nu.html

    The plugin definition must be available in the plugin registry file at parse
    time. Run `plugin add` first in the REPL to do this, or from a script consider
    preparing a plugin registry file and passing `--plugin-config`, or using the
    `--plugin` option to `nu` instead.

    If the plugin was already loaded, this will reload the latest definition from
    the registry file into scope.

    Note that even if the plugin filename is specified, it will only be loaded if
    it was already previously registered with `plugin add`.

    <div class='command-title'>Watch for file changes and execute Nu code when they happen.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> watch {flags} (path) (closure)```

    ## Flags

     -  `--debounce-ms, -d {int}`: Debounce changes for this many milliseconds (default: 100). Adjust if you find that single writes are reported as multiple events
     -  `--glob, -g {string}`: Only report changes for files that match this glob pattern (default: all files)
     -  `--recursive, -r {bool}`: Watch all directories under `<path>` recursively. Will be ignored if `<path>` is a file (default: true)
     -  `--quiet, -q`: Hide the initial status message (default: false)
     -  `--verbose, -v`: Operate in verbose mode (default: false)

    ## Parameters

     -  `path`: The path to watch. Can be a file or directory.
     -  `closure`: Some Nu code to run whenever a file changes. The closure will be passed `operation`, `path`, and `new_path` (for renames only) arguments in that order.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input   | output |
    | ------- | ------ |
    | nothing | table  |
    ## Examples

    Run `cargo test` whenever a Rust file changes
    ```nu
    > watch . --glob=**/*.rs {|| cargo test }

    ```

    Watch all changes in the current directory
    ```nu
    > watch . { |op, path, new_path| $"($op) ($path) ($new_path)"}

    ```

    Log all changes in a directory
    ```nu
    > watch /foo/bar { |op, path| $"($op) - ($path)(char nl)" | save --append changes_in_bar.log }

    ```

    # `interleave` for [filters](/commands/categories/filters.md)

    <div class='command-title'>Read multiple streams in parallel and combine them into one stream.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> interleave {flags} ...rest```

    ## Flags

     -  `--buffer-size, -b {int}`: Number of items to buffer from the streams. Increases memory usage, but can help performance when lots of output is produced.

    ## Parameters

     -  `...rest`: The closures that will generate streams to be combined.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input     | output    |
    | --------- | --------- |
    | list\<any\> | list\<any\> |
    | nothing   | list\<any\> |
    ## Examples

    Read two sequences of numbers into separate columns of a table.
    Note that the order of rows with 'a' columns and rows with 'b' columns is arbitrary.
    ```nu
    > seq 1 50 | wrap a | interleave { seq 1 50 | wrap b }

    ```

    Read two sequences of numbers, one from input. Sort for consistency.
    ```nu
    > seq 1 3 | interleave { seq 4 6 } | sort
    ╭───┬───╮
    │ 0 │ 1 │
    │ 1 │ 2 │
    │ 2 │ 3 │
    │ 3 │ 4 │
    │ 4 │ 5 │
    │ 5 │ 6 │
    ╰───┴───╯

    ```

    Read two sequences, but without any input. Sort for consistency.
    ```nu
    > interleave { "foo\nbar\n" | lines } { "baz\nquux\n" | lines } | sort
    ╭───┬──────╮
    │ 0 │ bar  │
    │ 1 │ baz  │
    │ 2 │ foo  │
    │ 3 │ quux │
    ╰───┴──────╯

    ```

    Run two commands in parallel and annotate their output.
    ```nu
    > (
    interleave
        { nu -c "print hello; print world" | lines | each { "greeter: " ++ $in } }
        { nu -c "print nushell; print rocks" | lines | each { "evangelist: " ++ $in } }
    )

    ```

    Use a buffer to increase the performance of high-volume streams.
    ```nu
    > seq 1 20000 | interleave --buffer-size 16 { seq 1 20000 } | math sum

    ```

    ## Notes
    This combinator is useful for reading output from multiple commands.

    If input is provided to `interleave`, the input will be combined with the
    output of the closures. This enables `interleave` to be used at any position
    within a pipeline.

    Because items from each stream will be inserted into the final stream as soon
    as they are available, there is no guarantee of how the final output will be
    ordered. However, the order of items from any given stream is guaranteed to be
    preserved as they were in that stream.

    If interleaving streams in a fair (round-robin) manner is desired, consider
    using `zip { ... } | flatten` instead.

    # `input listen` for [platform](/commands/categories/platform.md)

    <div class='command-title'>Listen for user interface event.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> input listen {flags} ```

    ## Flags

     -  `--types, -t {list<string>}`: Listen for event of specified types only (can be one of: focus, key, mouse, paste, resize)
     -  `--raw, -r`: Add raw_code field with numeric value of keycode and raw_flags with bit mask flags


    ## Input/output types:

    | input   | output                                           |
    | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
    | nothing | record\<keycode: string, modifiers: list\<string\>\> |
    ## Examples

    Listen for a keyboard shortcut and find out how nu receives it
    ```nu
    > input listen --types [key]

    ```

    ## Notes
    There are 5 different type of events: focus, key, mouse, paste, resize. Each will produce a
    corresponding record, distinguished by type field:
    ```
        { type: focus event: (gained|lost) }
        { type: key key_type: <key_type> code: <string> modifiers: [ <modifier> ... ] }
        { type: mouse col: <int> row: <int> kind: <string> modifiers: [ <modifier> ... ] }
        { type: paste content: <string> }
        { type: resize col: <int> row: <int> }
    ```
    There are 6 `modifier` variants: shift, control, alt, super, hyper, meta.
    There are 4 `key_type` variants:
        f - f1, f2, f3 ... keys
        char - alphanumeric and special symbols (a, A, 1, $ ...)
        media - dedicated media keys (play, pause, tracknext ...)
        other - keys not falling under previous categories (up, down, backspace, enter ...)

    ```

    ## Notes
    Be aware that this command 'unwraps' lists passed to it. So, if you pass a variable to it,
    and you want the variable's contents to be appended without being unwrapped, it's wise to
    pre-emptively wrap the variable in a list, like so: `append [$val]`. This way, `append` will
    only unwrap the outer list, and leave the variable's contents untouched.

  documentationQuestion2: How can a user append a list of strings to a string using the `append` command, and what is the expected output format?
  documentationQuestion3: What is the recommended practice when appending a variable to a list in Nushell to ensure its contents are not unwrapped unintentionally?

    <div class='command-title'>Time how long it takes a closure to run.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> timeit {flags} (command)```

    ## Parameters

     -  `command`: The closure to run.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input   | output   |
    | ------- | -------- |
    | any     | duration |
    | nothing | duration |
    ## Examples

    Time a closure containing one command

    ```

    Time a closure with an input value
    ```nu
    > 'A really long string' | timeit { split chars }

    ```

    Time a closure with an input stream
    ```nu
    > open some_file.txt | collect | timeit { split chars }

    ```

    Time a closure containing a pipeline
    ```nu
    > timeit { open some_file.txt | split chars }

    ```

    ## Notes
    Any pipeline input given to this command is passed to the closure. Note that streaming inputs may affect timing results, and it is recommended to add a `collect` command before this if the input is a stream.

    This command will bubble up any errors encountered when running the closure. The return pipeline of the closure is collected into a value and then discarded.

    ```> str replace {flags} (find) (replace) ...rest```

    ## Flags

     -  `--all, -a`: replace all occurrences of the pattern
     -  `--no-expand, -n`: do not expand capture groups (like $name) in the replacement string
     -  `--regex, -r`: match the pattern as a regular expression in the input, instead of a substring
     -  `--multiline, -m`: multi-line regex mode (implies --regex): ^ and $ match begin/end of line; equivalent to (?m)

    ## Parameters

     -  `find`: The pattern to find.
     -  `replace`: The replacement string.
     -  `...rest`: For a data structure input, operate on strings at the given cell paths.

    <div class='command-title'>Use definitions from a module, making them available in your shell.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> use {flags} (module) ...rest```

    ## Parameters

     -  `module`: Module or module file (`null` for no-op).
     -  `...rest`: Which members of the module to import.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input   | output  |
    | ------- | ------- |
    | nothing | nothing |
    ## Examples

    Define a custom command in a module and call it
    ```nu
    > module spam { export def foo [] { "foo" } }; use spam foo; foo
    foo
    ```

    Define a custom command that participates in the environment in a module and call it
    ```nu
    > module foo { export def --env bar [] { $env.FOO_BAR = "BAZ" } }; use foo bar; bar; $env.FOO_BAR
    BAZ
    ```

    Use a plain module name to import its definitions qualified by the module name
    ```nu
    > module spam { export def foo [] { "foo" }; export def bar [] { "bar" } }; use spam; (spam foo) + (spam bar)
    foobar
    ```

    Specify * to use all definitions in a module
    ```nu
    > module spam { export def foo [] { "foo" }; export def bar [] { "bar" } }; use spam *; (foo) + (bar)
    foobar
    ```

    To use commands with spaces, like subcommands, surround them with quotes
    ```nu
    > module spam { export def 'foo bar' [] { "baz" } }; use spam 'foo bar'; foo bar
    baz
    ```

    To use multiple definitions from a module, wrap them in a list
    ```nu
    > module spam { export def foo [] { "foo" }; export def 'foo bar' [] { "baz" } }; use spam ['foo', 'foo bar']; (foo) + (foo bar)
    foobaz
    ```

    ## Parameters

     -  `closure`: Generator function.
     -  `initial`: Initial value.

    ```

    Generate a continuous stream of Fibonacci numbers
    ```nu
    > generate {|fib| {out: $fib.0, next: [$fib.1, ($fib.0 + $fib.1)]} } [0, 1]

    ```

    Generate a continuous stream of Fibonacci numbers, using default parameters
    ```nu
    > generate {|fib=[0, 1]| {out: $fib.0, next: [$fib.1, ($fib.0 + $fib.1)]} }

    ```

    Generate a running sum of the inputs

    ╰───┴────╯

    ```

    ## Notes
    The generator closure accepts a single argument and returns a record
    containing two optional keys: 'out' and 'next'. Each invocation, the 'out'
    value, if present, is added to the stream. If a 'next' key is present, it is
    used as the next argument to the closure, otherwise generation stops.

    Additionally, if an input stream is provided, the generator closure accepts two
    arguments. On each invocation an element of the input stream is provided as the
    first argument. The second argument is the `next` value from the last invocation.
    In this case, generation also stops when the input stream stops.

    ## Signature

    ```> reduce {flags} (closure)```

    ## Flags

     -  `--fold, -f {any}`: reduce with initial value

    ## Parameters

     -  `closure`: Reducing function.


    ## Input/output types:

    | list\<any\> | any    |
    | range     | any    |
    | table     | any    |
    ## Examples

    Sum values of a list (same as 'math sum')
    ```nu
    > [ 1 2 3 4 ] | reduce {|it, acc| $it + $acc }
    10
    ```

    `reduce` accumulates value from left to right, equivalent to (((1 - 2) - 3) - 4).
    ```nu
    > [ 1 2 3 4 ] | reduce {|it, acc| $acc - $it }
    -8
    ```

    Sum values of a list, plus their indexes
    ```nu
    > [ 8 7 6 ] | enumerate | reduce --fold 0 {|it, acc| $acc + $it.item + $it.index }
    24
    ```

    Sum values with a starting value (fold)
    ```nu
    > [ 1 2 3 4 ] | reduce --fold 10 {|it, acc| $acc + $it }
    20
    ```

    Iteratively perform string replace (from left to right): 'foobar' -> 'bazbar' -> 'quuxbar'
    ```nu
    > [[foo baz] [baz quux]] | reduce --fold "foobar" {|it, acc| $acc | str replace $it.0 $it.1}
    quuxbar
    ```

    Replace selected characters in a string with 'X'
    ```nu
    > [ i o t ] | reduce --fold "Arthur, King of the Britons" {|it, acc| $acc | str replace --all $it "X" }
    ArXhur, KXng Xf Xhe BrXXXns
    ```

    Add ascending numbers to each of the filenames, and join with semicolons.
    ```nu
    > ['foo.gz', 'bar.gz', 'baz.gz'] | enumerate | reduce --fold '' {|str all| $"($all)(if $str.index != 0 {'; '})($str.index + 1)-($str.item)" }
    1-foo.gz; 2-bar.gz; 3-baz.gz
    ```

    Concatenate a string with itself, using a range to determine the number of times.
    ```nu
    > let s = "Str"; 0..2 | reduce --fold '' {|it, acc| $acc + $s}
    StrStrStr
    ```

    Merge multiple records together, making use of the fact that the accumulated value is also supplied as pipeline input to the closure.
    ```nu
    > [{a: 1} {b: 2} {c: 3}] | reduce {|it| merge $it}

    ## Notes
    the group-by command makes some assumptions:
        - if the input data is not a string, the grouper will convert the key to string but the values will remain in their original format. e.g. with bools, "true" and true would be in the same group (see example).
        - datetime is formatted based on your configuration setting. use `format date` to change the format.
        - filesize is formatted based on your configuration setting. use `format filesize` to change the format.
        - some nushell values are not supported, such as closures.

    # `debug profile` for [debug](/commands/categories/debug.md)

    <div class='command-title'>Profile pipeline elements in a closure.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> debug profile {flags} (closure)```

    ## Flags

     -  `--spans, -s`: Collect spans of profiled elements
     -  `--expand-source, -e`: Collect full source fragments of profiled elements
     -  `--values, -v`: Collect pipeline element output values
     -  `--lines, -l`: Collect line numbers
     -  `--duration-values, -d`: Report instruction duration as duration values rather than milliseconds
     -  `--max-depth, -m {int}`: How many blocks/closures deep to step into (default 2)

    ## Parameters

     -  `closure`: The closure to profile.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input | output |
    | ----- | ------ |
    | any   | table  |
    ## Examples

    Profile config evaluation
    ```nu
    > debug profile { source $nu.config-path }

    ```

    Profile config evaluation with more granularity
    ```nu
    > debug profile { source $nu.config-path } --max-depth 4

    ```

    ## Notes
    The profiler profiles every evaluated instruction inside a closure, stepping into all
    commands calls and other blocks/closures.

    The output can be heavily customized. By default, the following columns are included:
    - depth       : Depth of the instruction. Each entered block adds one level of depth. How many
                    blocks deep to step into is controlled with the --max-depth option.
    - id          : ID of the instruction
    - parent_id   : ID of the instruction that created the parent scope
    - source      : Source code that generated the instruction. If the source code has multiple lines,
                    only the first line is used and `...` is appended to the end. Full source code can
                    be shown with the --expand-source flag.
    - pc          : The index of the instruction within the block.
    - instruction : The pretty printed instruction being evaluated.
    - duration    : How long it took to run the instruction.
    - (optional) span        : Span associated with the instruction. Can be viewed via the `view span`
                               command. Enabled with the --spans flag.
    - (optional) output      : The output value of the instruction. Enabled with the --values flag.

    To illustrate the depth and IDs, consider `debug profile { do { if true { echo 'spam' } } }`. A unique ID is generated each time an instruction is executed, and there are two levels of depth:

    ```
    depth   id   parent_id                    source                     pc            instruction
        0    0           0   debug profile { do { if true { 'spam' } } }  0   <start>
        1    1           0   { if true { 'spam' } }                       0   load-literal    %1, closure(2164)
        1    2           0   { if true { 'spam' } }                       1   push-positional %1
        1    3           0   { do { if true { 'spam' } } }                2   redirect-out    caller
        1    4           0   { do { if true { 'spam' } } }                3   redirect-err    caller
        1    5           0   do                                           4   call            decl 7 "do", %0
        2    6           5   true                                         0   load-literal    %1, bool(true)
        2    7           5   if                                           1   not             %1
        2    8           5   if                                           2   branch-if       %1, 5
        2    9           5   'spam'                                       3   load-literal    %0, string("spam")
        2   10           5   if                                           4   jump            6
        2   11           5   { if true { 'spam' } }                       6   return          %0
        1   12           0   { do { if true { 'spam' } } }                5   return          %0
    ```

    Each block entered increments depth by 1 and each block left decrements it by one. This way you can
    control the profiling granularity. Passing --max-depth=1 to the above would stop inside the `do`
    at `if true { 'spam' }`. The id is used to identify each element. The parent_id tells you that the
    instructions inside the block are being executed because of `do` (5), which in turn was spawned from
    the root `debug profile { ... }`.

    For a better understanding of how instructions map to source code, see the `view ir` command.

    Note: In some cases, the ordering of pipeline elements might not be intuitive. For example,
    `[ a bb cc ] | each { $in | str length }` involves some implicit collects and lazy evaluation
    confusing the id/parent_id hierarchy. The --expr flag is helpful for investigating these issues.

    ## Signature

    ```> view span {flags} (start) (end)```

    ## Parameters

     -  `start`: Start of the span.
     -  `end`: End of the span.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input   | output |
    | ------- | ------ |

    ```

    ## Notes
    This command is meant for debugging purposes.
    It allows you to view the contents of nushell spans.
    One way to get spans is to pipe something into 'debug --raw'.
    Then you can use the Span { start, end } values as the start and end values for this command.

    ## Signature

    ```> each {flags} (closure)```

    ## Flags

     -  `--keep-empty, -k`: keep empty result cells

    ## Parameters

     -  `closure`: The closure to run.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input     | output    |
    | --------- | --------- |
    | any       | any       |
    | list\<any\> | list\<any\> |
    | table     | list\<any\> |
    ## Examples

    Multiplies elements in the list
    ```nu
    > [1 2 3] | each {|e| 2 * $e }
    ╭───┬───╮
    │ 0 │ 2 │
    │ 1 │ 4 │
    │ 2 │ 6 │
    ╰───┴───╯

    ```

    Produce a list of values in the record, converted to string
    ```nu
    > {major:2, minor:1, patch:4} | values | each {|| into string }
    ╭───┬───╮
    │ 0 │ 2 │
    │ 1 │ 1 │
    │ 2 │ 4 │
    ╰───┴───╯

    ```

    'null' items will be dropped from the result list. It has the same effect as 'filter_map' in other languages.
    ```nu
    > [1 2 3 2] | each {|e| if $e == 2 { "two" } }
    ╭───┬─────╮
    │ 0 │ two │
    │ 1 │ two │
    ╰───┴─────╯

    ```

    Iterate over each element, producing a list showing indexes of any 2s
    ```nu
    > [1 2 3] | enumerate | each {|e| if $e.item == 2 { $"found 2 at ($e.index)!"} }
    ╭───┬───────────────╮
    │ 0 │ found 2 at 1! │
    ╰───┴───────────────╯

    ```

    Iterate over each element, keeping null results
    ```nu
    > [1 2 3] | each --keep-empty {|e| if $e == 2 { "found 2!"} }
    ╭───┬──────────╮
    │ 0 │          │
    │ 1 │ found 2! │
    │ 2 │          │
    ╰───┴──────────╯

    ```

    ## Notes
    Since tables are lists of records, passing a table into 'each' will
    iterate over each record, not necessarily each cell within it.

    Avoid passing single records to this command. Since a record is a
    one-row structure, 'each' will only run once, behaving similar to 'do'.
    To iterate over a record's values, use 'items' or try converting it to a table
    with 'transpose' first.

    ## Parameters

     -  `field`: The name of the column to update.
     -  `replacement value`: The new value to give the cell(s), or a closure to create the value.


    ## Input/output types:

    | --------- | --------- |
    | list\<any\> | list\<any\> |
    | record    | record    |
    | table     | table     |
    ## Examples

    Update a column value
    ```nu
    > {'name': 'nu', 'stars': 5} | update name 'Nushell'
    ╭───────┬─────────╮
    │ name  │ Nushell │
    │ stars │ 5       │
    ╰───────┴─────────╯
    ```

    Use a closure to alter each value in the 'authors' column to a single string
    ```nu
    > [[project, authors]; ['nu', ['Andrés', 'JT', 'Yehuda']]] | update authors {|row| $row.authors | str join ',' }
    ╭───┬─────────┬──────────────────╮
    │ # │ project │     authors      │
    ├───┼─────────┼──────────────────┤
    │ 0 │ nu      │ Andrés,JT,Yehuda │
    ╰───┴─────────┴──────────────────╯

    ```

    Implicitly use the `$in` value in a closure to update 'authors'
    ```nu
    > [[project, authors]; ['nu', ['Andrés', 'JT', 'Yehuda']]] | update authors { str join ',' }
    ╭───┬─────────┬──────────────────╮
    │ # │ project │     authors      │
    ├───┼─────────┼──────────────────┤
    │ 0 │ nu      │ Andrés,JT,Yehuda │
    ╰───┴─────────┴──────────────────╯

    ```

    Update a value at an index in a list
    ```nu
    > [1 2 3] | update 1 4
    ╭───┬───╮
    │ 0 │ 1 │
    │ 1 │ 4 │
    │ 2 │ 3 │
    ╰───┴───╯

    ```

    Use a closure to compute a new value at an index
    ```nu
    > [1 2 3] | update 1 {|i| $i + 2 }
    ╭───┬───╮
    │ 0 │ 1 │
    │ 1 │ 4 │
    │ 2 │ 3 │
    ╰───┴───╯

    ```

    ## Notes
    When updating a column, the closure will be run for each row, and the current row will be passed as the first argument. Referencing `$in` inside the closure will provide the value at the column for the current row.

    When updating a specific index, the closure will instead be run once. The first argument to the closure and the `$in` value will both be the current value at the index.

    | table     | list\<any\> |
    ## Examples

    Multiplies each number. Note that the list will become arbitrarily disordered.
    ```nu
    > [1 2 3] | par-each {|e| $e * 2 }

    ```

    Multiplies each number, keeping an original order
    ```nu
    > [1 2 3] | par-each --keep-order {|e| $e * 2 }
    ╭───┬───╮
    │ 0 │ 2 │
    │ 1 │ 4 │
    │ 2 │ 6 │
    ╰───┴───╯

    ```

    Enumerate and sort-by can be used to reconstruct the original order
    ```nu
    > 1..3 | enumerate | par-each {|p| update item ($p.item * 2)} | sort-by item | get item
    ╭───┬───╮
    │ 0 │ 2 │
    │ 1 │ 4 │
    │ 2 │ 6 │
    ╰───┴───╯

    │ 0 │ bar! │
    │ 1 │ baz! │
    │ 2 │ foo! │
    ╰───┴──────╯

    ```

    Iterate over each element, producing a list showing indexes of any 2s
    ```nu
    > [1 2 3] | enumerate | par-each { |e| if $e.item == 2 { $"found 2 at ($e.index)!"} }

    ## Notes
    grid was built to give a concise gridded layout for ls. however,
    it determines what to put in the grid by looking for a column named
    'name'. this works great for tables and records but for lists we
    need to do something different. such as with '[one two three] | grid'
    it creates a fake column called 'name' for these values so that it
    prints out the list properly.

    ## Signature

    ```> job recv {flags} ```

    ## Flags

     -  `--tag {int}`: A tag for the message
     -  `--timeout {duration}`: The maximum time duration to wait for.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input   | output |

    Receive a message, wait for at most 10 seconds.
    ```nu
    > job recv --timeout 10sec

    ```

    Get a message or fail if no message is available immediately
    ```nu
    > job recv --timeout 0sec

    ```

    ## Notes
    When messages are sent to the current process, they get stored in what is called the "mailbox".
    This commands reads and returns a message from the mailbox, in a first-in-first-out fashion.
    j
    Messages may have numeric flags attached to them. This commands supports filtering out messages that do not satisfy a given tag, by using the `tag` flag.
    If no tag is specified, this command will accept any message.

    If no message with the specified tag (if any) is available in the mailbox, this command will block the current thread until one arrives.
    By default this command block indefinitely until a matching message arrives, but a timeout duration can be specified.
    If a timeout duration of zero is specified, it will succeed only if there already is a message in the mailbox.

    Note: When using par-each, only one thread at a time can utilize this command.
    In the case of two or more threads running this command, they will wait until other threads are done using it,
    in no particular order, regardless of the specified timeout parameter.

    # `view ir` for [debug](/commands/categories/debug.md)

    <div class='command-title'>View the compiled IR code for a block of code.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> view ir {flags} (target)```

    ## Flags

     -  `--json, -j`: Dump the raw block data as JSON (unstable).
     -  `--decl-id, -d`: Integer is a declaration ID rather than a block ID.

    ## Parameters

     -  `target`: The name or block to view compiled code for.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input   | output |
    | ------- | ------ |
    | nothing | string |
    ## Notes
    The target can be a closure, the name of a custom command, or an internal block
    ID. Closure literals within IR dumps often reference the block by ID (e.g.
    `closure(3231)`), so this provides an easy way to read the IR of any embedded
    closures.

    The --decl-id option is provided to use a declaration ID instead, which can be
    found on `call` instructions. This is sometimes better than using the name, as
    the declaration may not be in scope.

    ::: warning This command requires a plugin
    The `polars qcut` command resides in the `polars` plugin.
    To use this command, you must install and register `nu_plugin_polars`.
    See the [Plugins](/book/plugins.html) chapter in the book for more information.
    :::


    ## Signature

    ```> polars qcut {flags} (quantiles)```

    ## Flags

     -  `--labels, -l {list<string>}`: Names of the categories. The number of labels must be equal to the number of cut points plus one.
     -  `--left_closed, -c`: Set the intervals to be left-closed instead of right-closed.
     -  `--include_breaks, -b`: Include a column with the right endpoint of the bin each observation falls in. This will change the data type of the output from a Categorical to a Struct.
     -  `--allow_duplicates, -d`: If set, duplicates in the resulting quantiles are dropped, rather than raising an error. This can happen even with unique probabilities, depending on the data.

    ## Parameters

     -  `quantiles`: Either a list of quantile probabilities between 0 and 1 or a positive integer determining the number of bins with uniform probability.


    ## Input/output types:

    ## Notes
    Every XML entry is represented via a record with tag, attribute and content fields.
    To represent different types of entries different values are written to this fields:
    1. Tag entry: `{tag: <tag name> attrs: {<attr name>: "<string value>" ...} content: [<entries>]}`
    2. Comment entry: `{tag: '!' attrs: null content: "<comment string>"}`
    3. Processing instruction (PI): `{tag: '?<pi name>' attrs: null content: "<pi content string>"}`
    4. Text: `{tag: null attrs: null content: "<text>"}`.

    Unlike to xml command all null values are always present and text is never represented via plain
    string. This way content of every tag is always a table and is easier to parse

    ```nu
    > [1 2] | where {|x| $x > 1}
    ╭───┬───╮
    │ 0 │ 2 │
    ╰───┴───╯

    ```

    List all files in the current directory with sizes greater than 2kb
    ```nu
    > ls | where size > 2kb

    ```

    List only the files in the current directory
    ```nu
    > ls | where type == file

    ```

    List all files with names that contain "Car"
    ```nu
    > ls | where name =~ "Car"

    ```

    List all files that were modified in the last two weeks
    ```nu
    > ls | where modified >= (date now) - 2wk

    ```

    Find files whose filenames don't begin with the correct sequential number
    ```nu
    > ls | where type == file | sort-by name --natural | enumerate | where {|e| $e.item.name !~ $'^($e.index + 1)' } | each {|| get item }

    ```

    Find case-insensitively files called "readme", without an explicit closure
    ```nu
    > ls | where ($it.name | str downcase) =~ readme

    ```

    same as above but with regex only
    ```nu
    > ls | where name =~ '(?i)readme'

    ```

    ## Notes
    This command works similar to 'filter' but allows extra shorthands for working with
    tables, known as "row conditions". On the other hand, reading the condition from a variable is
    not supported.

    # `def` for [core](/commands/categories/core.md)

    <div class='command-title'>Define a custom command.</div>

    ## Signature

    ```> def {flags} (def_name) (params) (block)```

    ## Flags

     -  `--env`: keep the environment defined inside the command
     -  `--wrapped`: treat unknown flags and arguments as strings (requires ...rest-like parameter in signature)

    ## Parameters

     -  `def_name`: Command name.
     -  `params`: Parameters.
     -  `block`: Body of the definition.


    ## Input/output types:

    | input   | output  |
    | ------- | ------- |
    | nothing | nothing |
    ## Examples

    Define a command and run it
    ```nu
    > def say-hi [] { echo 'hi' }; say-hi
    hi
    ```

    Define a command and run it with parameter(s)
    ```nu
    > def say-sth [sth: string] { echo $sth }; say-sth hi
    hi
    ```

    Set environment variable by call a custom command
    ```nu
    > def --env foo [] { $env.BAR = "BAZ" }; foo; $env.BAR
    BAZ
    ```

    cd affects the environment, so '--env' is required to change directory from within a command
    ```nu
    > def --env gohome [] { cd ~ }; gohome; $env.PWD == ('~' | path expand)
    true
    ```

    Define a custom wrapper for an external command
    ```nu
    > def --wrapped my-echo [...rest] { ^echo ...$rest }; my-echo -e 'spam\tspam'
    spamspam
    ```

    Define a custom command with a type signature. Passing a non-int value will result in an error
    ```nu
    > def only_int []: int -> int { $in }; 42 | only_int
    42
    ```
