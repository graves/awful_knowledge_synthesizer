It can act on any number of objects per invocation, but\n     performs the same operation on all of them.\n\n     codesign accepts single-character (classic) options, as well as GNU-style\n     long options of the form --name and --name=value. Common options have\n     both forms; less frequent and specialized options have only long form.\n     Note that the form --name value (without equal sign) will not work as\n     expected on options with optional values."

    In the second synopsis form, codesign verifies the code signatures on all
         the path(s) given. The verification confirms that the code at those
         path(s) is signed, that the signature is valid, and that all sealed
         components are unaltered. Valid in this case means that the signature is
         structurally and cryptographically sound. If a requirement is given, each
         path is also checked against this requirement (but see DIAGNOSTICS
         below).  If verbose verification is requested, the program is also
         checked against its own designated requirement, which should never fail
         for a properly signed program.

         Note: Verification/validation do not check the signature against OS
         policy.  A valid/verified signature may still fail to meet Gatekeeper,
         Entitlements or other contextual policy requirements.

         If a path begins with a decimal digit, it is interpreted as the process
         id of a running process in the system, and dynamic validation is
         performed on that process instead.  This checks the code's dynamic status
         and just enough static data to close the nominal security envelope. Add
         at least one level of verbosity to also perform a full static check.

    In the third synopsis form, codesign displays the contents of the

         verbosity level increases.  This form may not completely verify the
         signatures on the path(s); though it may perform some verification steps
         in the process of obtaining information about the path(s).  If the -r
         path option is given, internal requirements will be extracted from the
         path(s) and written to path; specify a dash "-" to write to standard
         output. If the code does not contain an explicit designated requirement,
         the implied one will be retrieved and written out as a source comment.
         If the --entitlements path option is given, embedded entitlement data
         will be extracted likewise and written to the file specified.

         In the fourth synopsis form, codesign constructs the hosting path for
         each pid given and writes it, one host per line, to standard output. The
         hosting path is the chain of code signing hosts starting with the most
         specific code known to be running, and ending with the root of trust (the
         kernel). If the --verbose option is given, the dynamic validity status of
         each host is also displayed, separated from the path by a tab character.
         Note that hosting chains can at times be constructed for invalid or even
         unsigned code, and the output of this form of the codesign command should
         not be taken as a statement of formal code validity. Only codesign
         --verify can do that; and in fact, formal verification constructs the

    In the fifth synopsis form, codesign validates the path(s) supplied.
         Validation means ensuring that keys and operators are properly structured
         with appropriate types and that all keys and operators are known or
         nested in the $optional operator.

    SIGNING IDENTITIES
         To be used for code signing, a digital identity must be stored in a
         keychain that is on the calling user's keychain search list.  All
         keychain sources are supported if properly configured. In particular, it
         is possible to sign code with an identity stored on a supported smart
         card.  If your signing identity is stored in a different form, you need
         to make it available in keychain form to sign code with it.
         If the --keychain argument is used, identity is only looked-for in the
         specific keychain given. This is meant to help disambiguate references to
         identities.  Even in that case, the full keychain search list is still
         consulted for additional certificates needed to complete the signature.

If such a preference exists, it directly names the identity\n     used.  Otherwise, the identity is located by searching all keychains for\n     a certificate whose subject common name (only) contains the identity\n     string given. If there are multiple matches, the operation fails and no\n     signing is performed; however, an exact match is preferred over a partial\n     match.  These comparisons are case sensitive.  Multiple instances of the\n     exactly same certificate in multiple keychains are tolerated as harmless.\n\n     If identity consists of exactly forty hexadecimal digits, it is instead\n     interpreted as the SHA-1 hash of the certificate part of the desired\n     identity.\tIn this case, the identity's subject name is not considered.\n\n     Both identity preferences and certificate hashes can be used to identify\n     a particular signing identity regardless of name.

    Manpage text:

    If identity is the single letter "-" (dash), ad-hoc signing is performed.
         Ad-hoc signing does not use an identity at all, and identifies exactly
         one instance of code. Significant restrictions apply to the use of ad-hoc
         signed code; consult documentation before using this.

         codesign will attempt to embed the entire certificate chain documenting
         the signing identity in the code signature it generates, including any
         intermediate certificates and the anchor certificate. It looks for those
         in the keychain search list of the user performing the signing operation.
         If it cannot generate the entire certificate chain, signing may still
         succeed, but verification may fail if the verifying code does not have an
         independent source for the missing certificates (from its keychains).

    SPECIFYING REQUIREMENTS
         The requirement(s) arguments (-r and -R) can be given in various forms. A
         plain text argument is taken to be a path to a file containing the
         requirement(s).  codesign will accept both binary files containing
         properly compiled requirements code, and source files that are
         automatically compiled before use.  An argument of "-" requests that the
         requirement(s) are read from standard input.  Finally, an argument that
         begins with an equal sign "=" is taken as a literal requirements source
         text, and is compiled accordingly for use.

If you find it confusing, use the\n     unambiguous long forms --verbose and --verify instead.\n\n     The --verify option can take either a file or a pid. If your file path\n     starts with a number you should prefix it with \"./\" to force codesign to\n     interpret the argument as a path. For example:\n\t   codesign --verify 666\n     would become:\n\t   codesign --verify ./666\n\nNOTES\n     The Xcode build system invokes codesign automatically if the\n     CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY build variable is set.\tYou can express any\n     combination of codesign options with additional build variables there.\n\n     codesign is fundamentally a shell around the code signing APIs, and\n     performs nothing of the underlying work.  Replacing it with older or\n     newer versions is unlikely to have a useful effect.\n\n     codesign has several operations and options that are purposely left\n     undocumented in this manual page because they are either experimental\n     (and subject to change at any time), or unadvised to the unwary.  The\n     interminably curious are referred to the published source code."
