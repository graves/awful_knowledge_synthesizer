Except where noted below, these variables\n       should normally be treated as read-only by application-specific code\n       and by users.\n\n       itk::library\n\t      When an interpreter is created, [incr Tk] initializes this\n\t      variable to hold the name of a directory containing the system\n\t      library of [incr Tk] scripts.  The initial value of itk::library\n\t      is set from the ITK_LIBRARY environment variable if it exists,\n\t      or from a compiled-in value otherwise.\n\n\t      When [incr Tk] is added to an interpreter, it executes the\n\t      script \"init.itk\" in this directory.  This script, in turn,\n\t      looks for other script files with the name \"init.xxx\".  Mega-\n\t      widget libraries will be automatically initialized if they\n\t      install a script named \"init.xxx\" in this directory, where \"xxx\"\n\t      is the name of the mega-widget library.  For example, the\n\t      [incr Widgets] library installs the script \"init.iwidgets\" in\n\t      this directory.  This script establishes the \"iwidgets\"\n\t      namespace, and sets up autoloading for all [incr Widgets]\n\t      commands."
