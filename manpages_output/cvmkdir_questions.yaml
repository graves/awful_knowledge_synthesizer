If no option is used and the\n       directory exists, the cvmkdir command displays the assigned affinity.\n       Once an affinity is assigned to a directory, it cannot be altered.  If\n       no key is specified and the directory does not exist, the directory\n       will not be created.\n\n       An affinity may be dissociated from a directory by specifying an empty\n       key (e.g., \"\").\n\n       See snfs_config(5) for details about affinities to storage pools.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -k key Specify to the file system what affinity (key) to associate with\n\t      the directory.  All new sub-directories and files created\n\t      beneath this directory inherit its affinity.  If the affinity is\n\t      changed or removed only files or directories created after the\n\t      change are affected."
