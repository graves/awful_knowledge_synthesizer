While many perl developers have come from other languages,\n       and can use their prior knowledge where appropriate, there are many\n       other people who might benefit from a few perl specific pointers.  If\n       you want the condensed version, perhaps the best advice comes from the\n       renowned Japanese Samurai, Miyamoto Musashi, who said:\n\n\t\"Do Not Engage in Useless Activity\"\n\n       in 1645.\n\nOVERVIEW\n       Perhaps the most common mistake programmers make is to attempt to\n       optimize their code before a program actually does anything useful -\n       this is a bad idea.  There's no point in having an extremely fast\n       program that doesn't work.  The first job is to get a program to\n       correctly do something useful, (not to mention ensuring the test suite\n       is fully functional), and only then to consider optimizing it.  Having\n       decided to optimize existing working code, there are several simple but\n       essential steps to consider which are intrinsic to any optimization\n       process."

    ONE STEP SIDEWAYS
           Firstly, you need to establish a baseline time for the existing code,
           which timing needs to be reliable and repeatable.  You'll probably want
           to use the "Benchmark" or "Devel::NYTProf" modules, or something
           similar, for this step, or perhaps the Unix system "time" utility,
           whichever is appropriate.  See the base of this document for a longer
           list of benchmarking and profiling modules, and recommended further
           reading.

       ONE STEP FORWARD
           Next, having examined the program for hot spots, (places where the code
           seems to run slowly), change the code with the intention of making it
           run faster.  Using version control software, like "subversion", will
           ensure no changes are irreversible.  It's too easy to fiddle here and
           fiddle there - don't change too much at any one time or you might not
           discover which piece of code really was the slow bit.

       ANOTHER STEP SIDEWAYS
           It's not enough to say: "that will make it run faster", you have to
           check it.  Rerun the code under control of the benchmarking or
           profiling modules, from the first step above, and check that the new
           code executed the same task in less time.  Save your work and repeat...

    GENERAL GUIDELINES
           The critical thing when considering performance is to remember there is
           no such thing as a "Golden Bullet", which is why there are no rules,
           only guidelines.

           It is clear that inline code is going to be faster than subroutine or
           method calls, because there is less overhead, but this approach has the
           disadvantage of being less maintainable and comes at the cost of
           greater memory usage - there is no such thing as a free lunch.  If you
           are searching for an element in a list, it can be more efficient to
           store the data in a hash structure, and then simply look to see whether
           the key is defined, rather than to loop through the entire array using
           grep() for instance.  substr() may be (a lot) faster than grep() but
           not as flexible, so you have another trade-off to access.  Your code
           may contain a line which takes 0.01 of a second to execute which if you
           call it 1,000 times, quite likely in a program parsing even medium
           sized files for instance, you already have a 10 second delay, in just
           one single code location, and if you call that line 100,000 times, your
           entire program will slow down to an unbearable crawl.

    Using a subroutine as part of your sort is a powerful way to get
           exactly what you want, but will usually be slower than the built-in
           alphabetic "cmp" and numeric "<=>" sort operators.  It is possible to
           make multiple passes over your data, building indices to make the
           upcoming sort more efficient, and to use what is known as the "OM"
           (Orcish Maneuver) to cache the sort keys in advance.  The cache lookup,
           while a good idea, can itself be a source of slowdown by enforcing a
           double pass over the data - once to setup the cache, and once to sort
           the data.  Using "pack()" to extract the required sort key into a
           consistent string can be an efficient way to build a single string to
           compare, instead of using multiple sort keys, which makes it possible
           to use the standard, written in "c" and fast, perl "sort()" function on
           the output, and is the basis of the "GRT" (Guttman Rossler Transform).
           Some string combinations can slow the "GRT" down, by just being too
           plain complex for its own good.

The elapsed,\n       user and system times are clearly showing the time it took for\n       \"Devel::Profiler\" to execute its own run, but the column listings feel\n       more accurate somehow than the ones we had earlier from \"Devel::DProf\".\n       The 102% figure has disappeared, for example.  This is where we have to\n       use the tools at our disposal, and recognise their pros and cons,\n       before using them.  Interestingly, the numbers of calls for each\n       subroutine are identical in the two reports, it's the percentages which\n       differ.\tAs the author of \"Devel::Proviler\" writes:\n\n\t...running HTML::Template's test suite under Devel::DProf shows\n\toutput() taking NO time but Devel::Profiler shows around 10% of the\n\ttime is in output().  I don't know which to trust but my gut tells me\n\tsomething is wrong with Devel::DProf.  HTML::Template::output() is a\n\tbig routine that's called for every test. Either way, something needs\n\tfixing.\n\n       YMMV.\n\n       See also \"Devel::Apache::Profiler\" which hooks \"Devel::Profiler\" into\n       \"mod_perl\".\n\n   Devel::SmallProf\n       The \"Devel::SmallProf\" profiler examines the runtime of your Perl\n       program and produces a line-by-line listing to show how many times each\n       line was called, and how long each line took to execute.  It is called\n       by supplying the familiar \"-d\" flag to Perl at runtime.\n\n\t$> perl -d:SmallProf wordmatch -f perl5db.pl\n\n\t<...multiple lines snipped...>\n\n\twordmatch report for perl5db.pl:\n\tlines in file: 9428\n\twords in file: 50243\n\twords with special (non-word) characters: 20480\n\twords with only special (non-word) characters: 7790\n\twords with only consonants: 4801\n\twords with only capital letters: 1316\n\twords with only vowels: 1701\n\n       \"Devel::SmallProf\" writes it's output into a file called smallprof.out,\n       by default.

This was written with\n       a view to getting a faster line profiler, than is possible with for\n       example \"Devel::SmallProf\", because it's written in \"C\".  To use\n       \"Devel::FastProf\", supply the \"-d\" argument to Perl:\n\n\t$> perl -d:FastProf wordmatch -f perl5db.pl\n\n\t<...multiple lines snipped...>\n\n\twordmatch report for perl5db.pl:\n\tlines in file: 9428\n\twords in file: 50243\n\twords with special (non-word) characters: 20480\n\twords with only special (non-word) characters: 7790\n\twords with only consonants: 4801\n\twords with only capital letters: 1316\n\twords with only vowels: 1701\n\n       \"Devel::FastProf\" writes statistics to the file fastprof.out in the\n       current directory.

The differences in the actual times recorded\n       might be in the algorithm used internally, or it could be due to system\n       resource limitations or contention.\n\n       See also the DBIx::Profile which will profile database queries running\n       under the \"DBIx::*\" namespace.\n\n   Devel::NYTProf\n       \"Devel::NYTProf\" is the next generation of Perl code profiler, fixing\n       many shortcomings in other tools and implementing many cool features.\n       First of all it can be used as either a line profiler, a block or a\n       subroutine profiler, all at once.  It can also use sub-microsecond\n       (100ns) resolution on systems which provide \"clock_gettime()\".  It can\n       be started and stopped even by the program being profiled.  It's a one-\n       line entry to profile \"mod_perl\" applications.  It's written in \"c\" and\n       is probably the fastest profiler available for Perl.  The list of\n       coolness just goes on.

    Manpage text:

    Oodles of very useful information in there - this seems to be the way
           forward.

           See also "Devel::NYTProf::Apache" which hooks "Devel::NYTProf" into
           "mod_perl".

    SORTING
           Perl modules are not the only tools a performance analyst has at their
           disposal, system tools like "time" should not be overlooked as the next
           example shows, where we take a quick look at sorting.  Many books,
           theses and articles, have been written about efficient sorting
           algorithms, and this is not the place to repeat such work, there's
           several good sorting modules which deserve taking a look at too:
           "Sort::Maker", "Sort::Key" spring to mind.  However, it's still
           possible to make some observations on certain Perl specific
           interpretations on issues relating to sorting data sets and give an
           example or two with regard to how sorting large data volumes can effect
           performance.  Firstly, an often overlooked point when sorting large
           amounts of data, one can attempt to reduce the data set to be dealt
           with and in many cases "grep()" can be quite useful as a simple filter:

Beware too of pressure from managers who see you speed a program\n       up by 50% of the runtime once, only to get a request one month later to\n       do the same again (true story) - you'll just have to point out you're\n       only human, even if you are a Perl programmer, and you'll see what you\n       can do...\n\nLOGGING\n       An essential part of any good development process is appropriate error\n       handling with appropriately informative messages, however there exists\n       a school of thought which suggests that log files should be chatty, as\n       if the chain of unbroken output somehow ensures the survival of the\n       program.  If speed is in any way an issue, this approach is wrong."

Dumper(\\%INC) )\n\n       The problem is that this code will always be parsed and executed, even\n       when the debug level set in the logging configuration file is zero.\n       Once the debug() subroutine has been entered, and the internal $debug\n       variable confirmed to be zero, for example, the message which has been\n       sent in will be discarded and the program will continue.  In the\n       example given though, the \"\\%INC\" hash will already have been dumped,\n       and the message string constructed, all of which work could be bypassed\n       by a debug variable at the statement level, like this:\n\n\tlogger->debug( \"A logging message via process-id: $$ INC: \"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   . Dumper(\\%INC) ) if $DEBUG;\n\n       This effect can be demonstrated by setting up a test script with both\n       forms, including a \"debug()\" subroutine to emulate typical \"logger()\"\n       functionality."
