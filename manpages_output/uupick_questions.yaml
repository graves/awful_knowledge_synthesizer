It will then wait for the user to specify an action to\n       take.  One of the following commands must be entered:\n\n       `q'\n\t    Quit out of `uupick'.\n\n       `RETURN'\n\t    Skip the file.\n\n       `m [directory]'\n\t    Move the file or directory to the specified directory.  If no\n\t    directory is specified, the file is moved to the current\n       directory.\n\n       `a [directory]'\n\t    Move all files from this system to the specified directory.  If no\n\t    directory is specified, the files are moved to the current\n\t    directory.\n\n       `p'\n\t    List the file on standard output.\n\n       `d'\n\t    Delete the file.\n\n       `! [command]'\n\t    Execute `command' as a shell escape.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -s system, --system system\n\t    Used to restrict `uupick' to only present files transferred from a\n\t    particular system.\n\n       Standard UUCP options:\n\n       -x type, --debug type\n\t    Turn on particular debugging types.  The following types are\n\t    recognized: abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto, port,\n\t    config, spooldir, execute, incoming, outgoing.\n\n       -I file, --config\n\t    Set configuration file to use.\n\n       -v, --version\n\t    Report version information and exit.\n\n       --help\n\t    Print a help message and exit.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       uucp(1), uuto(1)\n\nAUTHOR\n       Ian Lance Taylor <ian@airs.com>.
