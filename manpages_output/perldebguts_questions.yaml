Caveat lector.\n\nDebugger Internals\n       Perl has special debugging hooks at compile-time and run-time used to\n       create debugging environments.  These hooks are not to be confused with\n       the perl -Dxxx command described in perlrun, which is usable only if a\n       special Perl is built per the instructions in the INSTALL podpage in\n       the Perl source tree.\n\n       For example, whenever you call Perl's built-in \"caller\" function from\n       the package \"DB\", the arguments that the corresponding stack frame was\n       called with are copied to the @DB::args array.  These mechanisms are\n       enabled by calling Perl with the -d switch.  Specifically, the\n       following additional features are enabled (cf. \"$^P\" in perlvar):"
