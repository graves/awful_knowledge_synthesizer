Common\n     verbs include attach, detach, verify, create, convert, and compact.\n\n     The rest of the verbs are currently: help, info, burn, checksum, chpass,\n     erasekeys, imageinfo, isencrypted, mountvol, unmount, plugins, udifrez,\n     udifderez, resize, segment, makehybrid, and pmap.\n\nBACKGROUND\n     Disk images are data containers that emulate disks.  Like disks, they can\n     be partitioned and formatted.  Many common uses of disk images blur the\n     distinction between the disk image container and its content, but this\n     distinction is critical to understanding how disk images work.  The terms\n     \"attach\" and \"detach\" are used to distinguish the way disk images are\n     connected to and disconnected from a system.  \"Mount\" and \"unmount\" are\n     the parallel filesystems options."

    Manpage text:

    For example, when you double-click a disk image in the macOS Finder, two
         separate things happen.  First, the image is "attached" to the system
         just like an external drive.  Then, the kernel and Disk Arbitration probe
         the new device for recognized file structures.  If any are discovered
         that should be mounted, the associated volumes will mount and appear on
         the desktop.

         When using disk images, always consider whether an operation applies to
         the blocks of the disk image container or to the (often file-oriented)
         content of the image.  For example, hdiutil verify verifies that the
         blocks stored in a read-only disk image have not changed since it was
         created.  It does not check whether the filesystem stored within the
         image is self-consistent (as diskutil verifyVolume would). On the other
         hand, hdiutil create -srcfolder creates a disk image container, puts a
         filesystem in it, and then copies the specified files to the new
         filesystem.

    Manpage text:

    SPARSE (UDSP) images and shadow files were designed for intermediate use
         when creating other images (e.g. UDZO) when final image sizes are
         unknown.  Generally speaking, SPARSE images are not recommended for
         persistent storage, though they are relatively safe on Mac OS X 10.3.2
         and later. On versions earlier than 10.3.2, SPARSE should be avoided in
         favor of UDRW images and resize.  On Mac OS X 10.5 and later, the more
         robust and faster SPARSEBUNDLE type is preferred.

         Note that both sparse formats, UDSP and UDSB, are growable only up to a
         limit: the size parameter specified when they were created. They will
         take up less space on the hosting filesystem if they contain less data
         than their created size, and grow up to that size as data is added.

         If more space is needed than is referenced by the hosted filesystem,
         hdiutil resize or diskutil(8) resize can help to grow or shrink the
         filesystem in an image.  compact reclaims unused space in sparse images.
         Though they request that hosted HFS+ filesystems use a special "front
         first" allocation policy, beware that sparse images can enhance the
         effects of any fragmentation in the hosted filesystem.

    Manpage text:

    To prevent errors when a filesystem inside of a sparse image has more
         free space than the volume holding the sparse image, HFS+ volumes inside
         sparse images will report an amount of free space slightly less than the
         amount of free space on the volume on which image resides.  The image
         filesystem currently only behaves this way as a result of a direct attach
         action and will not behave this way if, for example, the filesystem is
         unmounted and remounted.  Moving the image file to a different volume
         with sufficient free space will allow the image's filesystem to grow to
         its full size.

    DEVICE SPECIAL FILES
         Since any /dev entry can be treated as a raw disk image, it is worth
         noting which devices can be accessed when and how.  /dev/rdisk nodes are
         character-special devices, but are "raw" in the BSD sense and force
         block-aligned I/O.  They are closer to the physical disk than the buffer
         cache.  /dev/disk nodes, on the other hand, are buffered block-special
         devices and are used primarily by the kernel's filesystem code.

         Beware that information read from a raw device while a filesystem is
         mounted may not be consistent because the consistent data is stored in
         memory or in the filesystem's journal.

         The DiskImages framework will attempt to use authopen(1) to open any
         device which it can't open (due to EACCES) for reading with open(2).
         Depending on session characteristics, this behavior can cause apparent
         hangs while trying to access /dev entries while logged in remotely (an
         authorization panel is waiting on console).

         Generally, the /dev/disk node is preferred for imaging devices (e.g.
         convert or create -srcdevice operations), while /dev/rdisk is usable for
         the quick pmap or fsid.  In particular, converting the blocks of a
         mounted journaled filesystem to a read-only image will prevent the volume
         in the image from mounting (the journal will be permanently dirty).

    PERMISSIONS VS. OWNERS
         Some filesystems support permissions including users and groups.  While
         important for security on a managed filesystem, users and groups
         ("owners") pose challenges for unmanaged, shared filesystems such as
         those typically present in disk images.  macOS's solution to this problem
         is to make owners optional, both while creating files and enforcing
         permissions.

         By default, unknown HFS+ filesystems on "external" devices (including
         disk images) mount with their owners ignored (mount -o noowners).
         Normally when owners are ignored, the system uses a special _unknown user
         and group to dynamically substitute the current user's identity for any
         owners recorded in the filesystem.  These _unknown owners are even
         written to the volume when creating new files.  The new files will
         continue to have "floating" ownership when mounted with owners honored.
         The net result is that shared volumes behave as expected regardless of
         how they are accessed.

    Manpage text:

    NDIF (New Disk Image Format) images were developed to replace the Disk
         Copy 4.2 and DART image formats and to support images larger than a
         floppy disk.  With NDIF and Disk Copy version 6, images could be
         "attached" as mass storage devices under Mac OS 9.  Apple Data
         Compression (ADC) -- which carefully optimizes for fast decompression --
         was used to compress images that were typically created once and restored
         many times during manufacturing.

         UDIF (Universal Disk Image Format) device images picked up where NDIF
         left off, allowing images to represent entire block devices and all the
         data therein: DDM, partition map, disk-based drivers, etc.  For example,
         it can represent bootable CDs which can then be replicated from an image.
         To ensure single-fork files (NDIF was dual-fork), it began embedding its
         resource fork in the data fork.  UDIF is the native image format for OS
         X.

         Raw disk images from other operating systems (e.g. .iso files) will be
         recognized as disk images and can be attached and mounted if macOS
         recognizes the filesystems.  They can also be burned with hdiutil burn.

    WHAT'S NEW
         macOS 10.15 added ULMO format images compressed with lzma.  These images
         are smaller than comparable ULFO images compressed with lzfse.  These
         images are not supported in-kernel, and are not usable on earlier OSes.

         macOS 10.12 introduced the pre-release APFS for evaluation (see
         COMPATIBILITY above).  10.12 also added an option to disable atomic
         copying during image from folder operations, -noatomic, which may result
         in slightly faster image creation.  pmap added a new switch, -diagnostic,
         which captures troubleshooting information for Boot Camp configurations.

         OS X 10.11 added ULFO format images compressed with lzfse.  These images
         are more efficient and smaller than comparable UDZO images compressed
         with zlib, and retain kernel compatibility, but are not usable on earlier
         OSes.

         OS X 10.10 quadrupled the default UDIF chunk size without affecting
         backward compatibility.  UDIF images created or converted on 10.10 will
         benefit from smaller metadata and more efficient compression for UDZO and
         especially UDBZ formats.
