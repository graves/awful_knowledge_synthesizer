If the -i option is not used, all the required information to\n     establish a login to the remote server must be available in the afp URL,\n     including username & password if needed.\n\n     The arguments and options are:\n\n     -i      Interactive mode, you are prompted for the password if you did\n\t     not supply one in the url.\n\n     -s      Soft mount (default).  Network errors, e.g. timeouts, will be\n\t     retried for a much shorter amount of time.  If the network errors\n\t     persist, then the mount will be force unmounted.\n\n     -k      Hard mount.  Network errors, e.g. timeouts, will be retried for\n\t     an extended amount of time.  If the network errors persist, then\n\t     the mount will be force unmounted.\n\n     -o      Options passed to mount(2) are specified with the -o option\n\t     followed by a comma separated string of options. See the mount(8)\n\t     man page for possible options and their meanings. Additional\n\t     options supported by the AFP Client are as follows:\n\n\t     nobrowse\n\t\t     Indicate to the Carbon subsystem that this volume is not\n\t\t     to be displayed to the user.\n\n\t     automounted\n\t\t     Set flags on the mountpoint to indicate that the volume\n\t\t     has been mounted by the automounter.\n\n     afp_url\n\t     There are two forms of afp URL, one for TCP/IP and one for\n\t     AppleTalk:\n\n\t     afp://[user[;AUTH=uamname][:password]@]host[:port]/volume\n\n\t     afp:/at/[user[;AUTH=uamname][:password]@]servername[:zonename]/volume\n\n\t     Denotes the afp server and sharepoint to mount. It may also\n\t     contain the username & password required to log into the server.\n\t     uamname is the protocol name of the authentication method.  If\n\t     port is not specified, then port 548 is used.\n\n     node    Path to mount point, which must be a directory that the user has\n\t     write permissions for.\n\nEXAMPLES\n     The following example illustrates how to mount the afp volume\n     server.company.com/volumename/ at the mount point /Volumes/mntpnt:\n\n\t   mkdir /Volumes/mntpnt\n\t   mount_afp afp://username:userpass@server.company.com/volumename/ /Volumes/mntpnt\n\n     This example shows the proper url to use to mount the volume guestVolume\n     from the afp server myserver as guest (if no uam and no username, then\n     use guest uam):\n\n\t   mkdir /Volumes/guest\n\t   mount_afp \"afp://myserver/guestVolume\" /Volumes/guest\n\n     This example shows the proper url to use to mount the volume myVolume\n     from the afp server myserver using Kerberos authentication:\n\n\t   mkdir /Volumes/myVolume\n\t   mount_afp \"afp://;AUTH=Client%20Krb%20v2@myserver/myVolume\" /Volumes/myVolume"
