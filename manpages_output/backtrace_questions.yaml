    Manpage text:

    backtrace_symbols() attempts to transform a call stack obtained by
         backtrace() into an array of human-readable strings using dladdr().  The
         array of strings returned has size elements.  It is allocated using
         malloc() and should be released using free().  There is no need to free
         the individual strings in the array.

         backtrace_symbols_fd() performs the same operation as
         backtrace_symbols(), but the resulting strings are immediately written to
         the file descriptor fd, and are not returned.

         backtrace_image_offsets() attempts to transform a call stack obtained by
         backtrace() into an array of image offsets, for deferred symbolication.
         Each entry in the array has an offset relative to the __TEXT section of
         the image with the given UUID.  The results are written to image_offsets
         which should be an array of size length.

         backtrace_from_fp() takes a backtrace of frames starting from the given
         frame pointer.

         backtrace_async() behaves exactly like backtrace() unless it is invoked
         from a Swift async context.  In that case, instead of writing the return
         addresses of the OS call stack, the continuation addresses of the async
         invocations that led to the current state are provided.  If unwinding an
         async stack rather than an OS stack, the value pointed to by task_id will
         be set to a non-zero identifier that for the current process uniquely
         identifies the async task currently running.  Otherwise, 0 is stored.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `backtrace`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nNote that the continuation addresses provided by backtrace_async() have\n     an offset of 1 added to them.  Most symbolication engines will substract\n     1 from the call stack return addresses in order to symbolicate the call\n     site rather than the return location.  With a Swift async continuation,\n     substracting 1 from its address would result in an address in a different\n     function.\tThis offset allows the returned addresses to be handled\n     correctly by most existing symbolication engines.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\t #include <execinfo.h>\n\t #include <stdio.h>\n\t ...\n\t void* callstack[128];\n\t int i, frames = backtrace(callstack, 128);\n\t char** strs = backtrace_symbols(callstack, frames);\n\t for (i = 0; i < frames; ++i) {\n\t     printf(\"%s\\n\", strs[i]);\n\t }\n\t free(strs);\n\t ...\n\nHISTORY\n     backtrace(), backtrace_symbols(), and backtrace_symbols_fd() first\n     appeared in Mac OS X 10.5.  backtrace_image_offsets() and\n     backtrace_from_fp() first appeared macOS 10.14 and iOS 12.\n     backtrace_async() first appeared in macOS 12."
