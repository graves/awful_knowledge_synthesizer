Big computers are much bigger, and personal computers have capabilities that  \nrival mainframes of a decade ago. During this time, C has changed too, although only modestly,  \nand it has spread far beyond its origins as the language of the UNIX operating system.  \n\nThe growing popularity of C, the changes in the language over the years, and the creation of  \ncompilers by groups not involved in its design, combined to demonstrate a need for a more precise  \nand more contemporary definition of the language than the first edition of this book provided. In  \n1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established a committee whose goal was  \nto produce ``an unambiguous and machine-independent definition of the language C'', while still  \nretaining its spirit. The result is the ANSI standard for C.\n\nThe text is from The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Preprocessor Directives**\n\nConsider the following code snippet: \n\n``c\n#define PI 3.14159\n#define AREA(r) (PI * r * r)\nint main() {\n    double radius = 5.0;\n    double area = AREA(radius);\n    return 0;\n} \n``\n\n**Task**: Explain how the preprocessor handles this code, focusing on the expansion of the macro `AREA(r)` and its effect on the resulting compiled code.\n- **Step 1**: Describe what happens during the preprocessing stage when `AREA(radius)` is encountered.\n- **Step 2**: Justify why this approach might be considered a form of "code generation" rather than traditional programming.\n- **Step 3**: Compare and contrast the use of macros with functions in terms of performance, readability, and maintainability.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of macro expansion and its implications for code structure and behavior.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Application of Standard Library Functions**\n\nWrite a program that reads a line of input from the user, processes it using functions from the `<stdio.h>` and `<string.h>` libraries, and outputs the result. The program must: \n- Use `fgets()` to read a string from standard input.\n- Use `strlen()` to determine the length of the input string.\n- Use `strcpy()` to copy the string into a new buffer.\n- Output both the original and modified strings.\n\n**Task**: \n- **Part A**: Explain how each function contributes to the program''s functionality, referencing their definitions in the text.\n- **Part B**: Discuss potential issues that might arise from using `fgets()` instead of `scanf()`, based on the text''s discussion of input handling.\n- **Part C**: Propose an alternative approach using `<ctype.h>` functions to process the string (e.g., converting to uppercase).\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate proficiency in using standard library functions and an understanding of their limitations and applications.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Logical Reasoning with C Standards**\n\nThe text discusses the evolution of the C language and its ANSI standardization. Consider the following scenario: \n- A programmer writes a function that uses `printf()` with a format string containing `%d` for an integer argument.\n- The code is compiled on a system where the C standard requires that all format specifiers in `printf()` must match the types of the arguments.\n\n**Task**: \n- **Part A**: Explain what happens if the programmer passes a floating-point value instead of an integer to `%d`. Justify your answer based on the text''s discussion of undefined behavior in C.\n- **Part B**: Discuss how the ANSI standard addresses this issue and what changes would be required to make the code portable across different systems.\n- **Part C**: Construct a scenario where using `printf()` with mismatched format specifiers could lead to unexpected results, and explain why this is a critical consideration in C programming.\n\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must demonstrate an understanding of C''s type safety mechanisms and the importance of adhering to the ANSI standard.'

    The standard formalizes constructions that were hinted but not described in the first edition, particularly structure assignment and enumerations. It provides a new form of function declaration that permits cross-checking of definition with use. It specifies a standard library, with an extensive set of functions for performing input and output, memory management, string manipulation, and similar tasks. It makes precise the behavior of features that were not spelled out in the original definition, and at the same time states explicitly which aspects of the language remain machine-dependent.

    This Second Edition of The C Programming Language describes C as defined by the ANSI standard. Although we have noted the places where the language has evolved, we have chosen to write exclusively in the new form. For the most part, this makes no significant difference; the most visible change is the new form of function declaration and definition. Modern compilers already support most features of the standard.

    We have tried to retain the brevity of the first edition. C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book. We have improved the exposition of critical features, such as pointers, that are central to C programming. We have refined the original examples, and have added new examples in several chapters. For instance, the treatment of complicated declarations is augmented by programs that convert declarations into words and vice versa. As before, all examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form.

    Appendix A, the reference manual, is not the standard, but our attempt to convey the essentials of the standard in a smaller space. It is meant for easy comprehension by programmers, but not as a definition for compiler writers -- that role properly belongs to the standard itself. Appendix B is a summary of the facilities of the standard library. It too is meant for reference by programmers, not implementers. Appendix C is a concise summary of the changes from the original version.

    As we said in the preface to the first edition, C ``wears well as one's experience with it grows''. With a decade more experience, we still feel that way. We hope that this book will help you learn C and use it well.

  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Standard Library Functions**\n\nUsing the information provided in the text about the standard library, describe a scenario where a programmer might need to use multiple functions from the standard library to solve a problem.\n- **Step 1**: Identify at least two specific functions from the standard library that could be used in this scenario.\n- **Step 2**: Explain how these functions work together to achieve the desired outcome.\n- **Step 3**: Justify why these functions are part of the standard library rather than being implemented as custom code.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the purpose and functionality of standard library functions, as well as their role in efficient programming.'
  finalExamQuestion2: '**Logical Reasoning with Language Evolution**\n\nThe text mentions that the language has evolved since the first edition, but the second edition is written in the new form. Consider the statement: "The new form of function declaration and definition makes no significant difference in most cases."\n- **Part A**: Explain why this statement might be true based on the text''s description of the changes.\n- **Part B**: Provide an example of a situation where the new form could make a noticeable difference.\n- **Part C**: Reflect on how the evolution of the language reflects broader trends in programming language design, such as consistency and clarity.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the text''s discussion of language changes and demonstrate critical thinking about the implications of these changes.'
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Application of Number Classifications**\n\nThe text discusses the standard library''s functions for string manipulation and memory management. Consider the following scenario: A programmer is writing a function to calculate the length of a string using only standard library functions.\n- **Part A**: Identify which standard library function would be most appropriate for this task.\n- **Part B**: Explain how this function works based on the text''s description of the standard library.\n- **Part C**: Construct a simple program that demonstrates the use of this function, ensuring it adheres to the standards described in the text.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of the standard library functions and their practical applications in programming.'

    We are deeply indebted to friends who helped us to produce this second edition. Jon Bently, Doug Gwyn, Doug McIlroy, Peter Nelson, and Rob Pike gave us perceptive comments on almost every page of draft manuscripts. We are grateful for careful reading by Al Aho, Dennis Allison, Joe Campbell, G.R. Emlin, Karen Fortgang, Allen Holub, Andrew Hume, Dave Kristol, John Linderman, Dave Prosser, Gene Spafford, and Chris van Wyk. We also received helpful suggestions from Bill Cheswick, Mark Kernighan, Andy Koenig, Robin Lake, Tom London, Jim Reeds, Clovis Tondo, and Peter Weinberger. Dave Prosser answered many detailed questions about the ANSI standard. We used Bjarne Stroustrup's C++ translator extensively for local testing of our programs, and Dave Kristol provided us with an ANSI C compiler for final testing. Rich Drechsler helped greatly with typesetting.

    Our sincere thanks to all.

    Preface to the first edition

    C is a general-purpose programming language with features economy of expression, modern flow control and data structures, and a rich set of operators. C is not a ``very high level'' language, nor a ``big'' one, and is not specialized to any particular area of application. But its absence of restrictions and its generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks than supposedly more powerful languages.

    C was originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating system on the DEC PDP-11, by Dennis Ritchie. The operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX applications programs (including all of the software used to prepare this book) are written in C. Production compilers also exist for several other machines, including the IBM System/370, the Honeywell 6000, and the Interdata 8/32. C is not tied to any particular hardware or system, however, and it is easy to write programs that will run without change on any machine that supports C.

    The text is from The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

    This book is meant to help the reader learn how to program in C. It contains a tutorial introduction to get new users started as soon as possible, separate chapters on each major feature, and a reference manual. Most of the treatment is based on reading, writing and revising examples, rather than on mere statements of rules. For the most part, the examples are complete, real programs rather than isolated fragments. All examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form. Besides showing how to make effective use of the language, we have also tried where possible to illustrate useful algorithms and principles of good style and sound design.

    The book is not an introductory programming manual; it assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment statements, loops, and functions. Nonetheless, a novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language, although access to more knowledgeable colleague will help.

    In our experience, C has proven to be a pleasant, expressive and versatile language for a wide variety of programs. It is easy to learn, and it wears well as on's experience with it grows. We hope that this book will help you to use it well.

    The thoughtful criticisms and suggestions of many friends and colleagues have added greatly to this book and to our pleasure in writing it. In particular, Mike Bianchi, Jim Blue, Stu Feldman, Doug McIlroy Bill Roome, Bob Rosin and Larry Rosler all read multiple volumes with care. We are also indebted to Al Aho, Steve Bourne, Dan Dvorak, Chuck Haley, Debbie Haley, Marion Harris, Rick Holt, Steve Johnson, John Mashey, Bob Mitze, Ralph Muha, Peter Nelson, Elliot Pinson, Bill Plauger, Jerry Spivack, Ken Thompson, and Peter Weinberger for helpful comments at various stages, and to Mile Lesk and Joe Ossanna for invaluable assistance with typesetting.

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nLet us begin with a quick introduction in C. Our aim is to show the essential elements of the \nlanguage in real programs, but without getting bogged down in details, rules, and exceptions. At \nthis point, we are not trying to be complete or even precise (save that the examples are meant to be \ncorrect). We want to get you as quickly as possible to the point where you can write useful \nprograms, and to do that we have to concentrate on the basics: variables and constants, arithmetic, \ncontrol flow, functions, and the rudiments of input and output.

These include pointers, \nstructures, most of C's rich set of operators, several control-flow statements, and the standard \nlibrary. \n\nThis approach and its drawbacks. Most notable is that the complete story on any particular feature \nis not found here, and the tutorial, by being brief, may also be misleading. And because the \nexamples do not use the full power of C, they are not as concise and elegant as they might be. We \nhave tried to minimize these effects, but be warned. Another drawback is that later chapters will \nnecessarily repeat some of this chapter. We hope that the repetition will help you more than it \nannoys. \n\nIn any case, experienced programmers should be able to extrapolate from the material in this \nchapter to their own programming needs.

    Just how to run this program depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in ``.c'', such as hello.c, then compile it with the command

       cc hello.c

    If you haven't botched anything, such as omitting a character or misspelling something, the compilation will proceed silently, and make an executable file called a.out. If you run a.out by typing the command

       a.out

    it will print

       hello, world

    On other systems, the rules will be different; check with a local expert.

    Now, for some explanations about the program itself. A C program, whatever its size, consists of functions and variables. A function contains statements that specify the computing operations to be done, and variables store values used during the computation. C functions are like the subroutines and functions in Fortran or the procedures and functions of Pascal. Our example is a function named main. Normally you are at liberty to give functions whatever names you like, but ``main'' is special - your program begins executing at the beginning of main. This means that every program must have a main somewhere.

    main will usually call other functions to help perform its job, some that you wrote, and others from libraries that are provided for you. The first line of the program,

       #include <stdio.h>

    tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library; the line appears at the beginning of many C source files. The standard library is described in Chapter 7 and Appendix B.

    One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide a list of values, called arguments, to the function it calls. The parentheses after the function name surround the argument list. In this example, main is defined to be a function that expects no arguments, which is indicated by the empty list ( ).

    #include <stdio.h>                /* include information about standard library */
    main()                            /* define a function called main */
                                      /* that received no argument values */
    {                                 /* statements of main are enclosed in braces */
        printf("hello, world\n");     /* main calls library function printf */
                                      /* to print this sequence of characters */
    }                                 /* \n represents the newline character */

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nThe statements of a function are enclosed in braces { }. The function main contains only one  \nstatement,  \n\n   printf(\"hello, world\\n\");\nA function is called by naming it, followed by a parenthesized list of arguments, so this calls the  \nfunction printf with the argument \"hello, world\\n\". printf is a library function that prints \noutput, in this case the string of characters between the quotes. \n\nA sequence of characters in double quotes, like \"hello, world\\n\", is called a character string or \nstring constant. For the moment our only use of character strings will be as arguments for printf \nand other functions. \n\nThe sequence \\n in the string is C notation for the newline character, which when printed \nadvances the output to the left margin on the next line. If you leave out the \\n (a worthwhile \nexperiment), you will find that there is no line advance after the output is printed. You must use \n\\n to include a newline character in the printf argument; if you try something like \n\n   \n   printf(\"hello, world\n   \");\nthe C compiler will produce an error message. \n\nprintf never supplies a newline character automatically, so several calls may be used to build up \nan output line in stages. Our first program could just as well have been written \n\n   #include <stdio.h>\n\n   main()\n   {\n     printf(\"hello, \");\n     printf(\"world\");\n     printf(\"\\n\");\n   }\nto produce identical output. \n\nNotice that \\n represents only a single character. An escape sequence like \\n provides a general \nand extensible mechanism for representing hard-to-type or invisible characters. Among the others \nthat C provides are \\t for tab, \\b for backspace, \\\" for the double quote and \\\\ for the backslash \nitself. There is a complete list in Section 2.3. \n\nExercise 1-1. Run the ``hello, world'' program on your system. Experiment with leaving out \nparts of the program, to see what error messages you get. \n\nExercise 1-2.

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted version of the text:

    ```c
    int fahr, celsius;
    int lower, upper, step;
    ```

    The type `int` means that the variables listed are integers; by contrast with `float`, which means floating point, i.e., numbers that may have a fractional part. The range of both `int` and `float` depends on the machine you are using; 16-bit `ints`, which lie between -32768 and +32767, are common, as are 32-bit `ints`. A `float` number is typically a 32-bit quantity, with at least six significant digits and magnitude generally between about 10^-38 and 10^38.

    C provides several other data types besides `int` and `float`, including:

    - `char` - a single byte
    - `short` - short integer
    - `long` - long integer
    - `double` - double-precision floating point

    The size of these objects is also machine-dependent. There are also arrays, structures and unions of these basic types, pointers to them, and functions that return them, all of which we will meet in due course.

    Computation in the temperature conversion program begins with the assignment statements

    ```c
    lower = 0;
    upper = 300;
    step = 20;
    ```

    which set the variables to their initial values. Individual statements are terminated by semicolons.

    Each line of the table is computed the same way, so we use a loop that repeats once per output line; this is the purpose of the `while` loop

    ```c
    while (fahr <= upper) {
       ...
    }
    ```

    The `while` loop operates as follows: The condition in parentheses is tested. If it is true (`fahr` is less than or equal to `upper`), the body of the loop (the three statements enclosed in braces) is executed. Then the condition is re-tested, and if true, the body is executed again. When the test becomes false (`fahr` exceeds `upper`) the loop ends, and execution continues at the statement that follows the loop. There are no further statements in this program, so it terminates.

    The body of a `while` can be one or more statements enclosed in braces, as in the temperature converter, or a single statement without braces, as in

    Here is the corrected and properly formatted text based on your request:

    ---

    `printf` is just a useful function from the standard library of functions that are normally accessible to C programs. The behaviour of `printf` is defined in the ANSI standard, however, so its properties should be the same with any compiler and library that conforms to the standard.

    In order to concentrate on C itself, we don't talk much about input and output until chapter 7. In particular, we will defer formatted input until then. If you have to input numbers, read the discussion of the function `scanf` in Section 7.4. `scanf` is like `printf`, except that it reads input instead of writing output.

    There are a couple of problems with the temperature conversion program. The simpler one is that the output isn't very pretty because the numbers are not right-justified. That's easy to fix; if we augment each `%d` in the `printf` statement with a width, the numbers printed will be right-justified in their fields. For instance, we might say

       `printf("%3d %6d\n", fahr, celsius);`

    to print the first number of each line in a field three digits wide, and the second in a field six digits wide, like this:

         0     -17
        20      -6
        40       4
        60      15
        80      26
       100      37
       ...

    The more serious problem is that because we have used integer arithmetic, the Celsius temperatures are not very accurate; for instance, 0°F is actually about -17.8°C, not -17. To get more accurate answers, we should use floating-point arithmetic instead of integer. This requires some changes in the program. Here is the second version:

       `#include <stdio.h>`

       /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
           for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300; floating-point version */
       `main()`
       {
         float fahr, celsius;

    **Logical Reasoning with C Program Structure**\n\nThe text describes a program that prints a Fahrenheit-Celsius temperature table. Consider the following modified version of the code:\n\n```
    #include <stdio.h>

    /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table
       for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300; floating-point version */
    main()
    {
      float fahr, celsius;
      float lower, upper, step;

      lower = 0;      /* lower limit of temperature scale */
      upper = 300;    /* upper limit */
      step = 20;      /* step size */

      fahr = lower;
      while (fahr <= upper) {
        celsius = (5.0/9.0)*(fahr - 32);
        printf("%3.1f %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);
        fahr += step;
      }
    }
    ```\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain why the original program in the text used integer arithmetic and how this affects the output compared to the modified version.\n- **Part B**: Analyze the loop structure of the modified program. Why is `fahr` initialized to `lower` and incremented by `step` in each iteration?\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of using floating-point variables for `fahr` and `celsius`. How does this affect the precision and accuracy of the temperature conversions?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must integrate an understanding of C programming concepts, data types, and control structures as described in the text.
  finalExamQuestion3: '**Creative Problem Solving with C Functions**\n\nThe text discusses the `printf` function and its role in formatted output. Imagine you are writing a program that needs to print a table of values with varying column widths and precision. For example, you might want to print a table like this:\n\n  0   -17.8    3.1416\n 20    -6.7    2.7183\n 40     4.4    1.6180\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Design a `printf` statement that would produce this output format. Justify your choice of formatting specifiers and field widths.\n- **Part B**: Explain how the use of floating-point arithmetic in the program affects the accuracy of the output compared to using integer types.\n- **Part C**: Propose a modification to the program that would allow for dynamic column widths based on input parameters. How would this change the structure of the code?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate creative problem-solving skills and an understanding of how formatting, data types, and program structure interact in C as described in the text.'

- prompt: "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nHere is the corrected and properly formatted text:\n\n```c\nwhile (fahr <= upper) {\n    celsius = (5.0/9.0) * (fahr - 32.0);\n    printf(\"%3.0f %6.1f\\n\", fahr, celsius);\n    fahr = fahr + step;\n}\n```\n\nThis is much the same as before, except that `fahr` and `celsius` are declared to be `float` and the formula for conversion is written in a more natural way. We were unable to use `5/9` in the previous version because integer division would truncate it to zero. A decimal point in a constant indicates that it is floating point, however, so `5.0/9.0` is not truncated because it is the ratio of two floating-point values.\n\nIf an arithmetic operator has integer operands, an integer operation is performed. If an arithmetic operator has one floating-point operand and one integer operand, however, the integer will be converted to floating point before the operation is done. If we had written `(fahr - 32)`, the `32` would be automatically converted to floating point. Nevertheless, writing floating-point constants with explicit decimal points even when they have integral values emphasizes their floating-point nature for human readers.\n\nThe detailed rules for when integers are converted to floating point are in Chapter 2. For now, notice that the assignment\n\n```c\nfahr = lower;\n```\n\nand the test\n\n```c\nwhile (fahr <= upper)\n```\n\nalso work in the natural way - the `int` is converted to `float` before the operation is done.\n\nThe `printf` conversion specification `%3.0f` says that a floating-point number (here `fahr`) is to be printed at least three characters wide, with no decimal point and no fraction digits. `%6.1f` describes another number (celsius) that is to be printed at least six characters wide, with 1 digit after the decimal point. The output looks like this:\n\n```\n    0   -17.8\n    20    -6.7\n    40     4.4\n   ...\n```\n\nWidth and precision may be omitted from a specification: `%6f` says that the number is to be at least six characters wide; `%.2f` specifies two characters after the decimal point, but the width is not constrained; and `%f` merely says to print the number as floating point.\n\n `%d` \n\nprint as decimal integer\n\nThe text is from The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie."
  finalExamQuestion1: '**Synthesis of Conditional Loop Logic**\n\nExplain how the provided C code converts Fahrenheit to Celsius, focusing on the role of data types in the conversion process. Specifically, address the following points:\n- **Part A**: Why is `fahr` declared as a `float` and not an `int`? How does this affect the loop''s behavior when incrementing by `step` (e.g., 2 degrees)?\n- **Part B**: Analyze the line `celsius = (5.0/9.0) * (fahr - 32.0);`. Why is `5.0/9.0` written with decimal points instead of `5/9`? How does this ensure accurate floating-point computation?\n- **Part C**: Discuss the line `printf("%3.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius);`. What is the significance of the format specifiers `%3.0f` and `%6.1f` in displaying the output? How might this affect readability when printing multiple temperature conversions?\n**Answer Requirement**: Your explanation must integrate an understanding of data types, arithmetic operations, and formatting in C as described in the text.'

    **Application of Integer to Floating-Point Conversion Rules**\n\nConsider the following code snippet from the text:\n```c
    int fahr = 32;
    float celsius;
    celsius = (5.0/9.0) * (fahr - 32.0);
    ```\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain why the integer `fahr` is converted to a floating-point value during the calculation of `celsius`. How does this conversion affect the result?\n- **Part B**: Modify the code so that `fahr` remains an integer, but the result `celsius` is still computed accurately. Justify your approach using the rules for integer and floating-point conversions in the text.\n- **Part C**: Discuss the implications of using integer arithmetic versus floating-point arithmetic in temperature conversion. Provide a real-world example where precision might be critical and explain why it matters.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your answer must demonstrate an understanding of implicit type conversions and their impact on computational accuracy.

    **Logical Reasoning with Data Type Specifications**\n\nThe text describes the role of format specifiers in `printf` and how they determine the output representation of variables. Using this knowledge, consider the following scenario:\n\nA software developer is writing a program to print student grades, where each grade is stored as an integer (0–100). The developer uses the following code: \n```c
    int score = 85;
    printf("%d%%\", score);
    ```\n\n**Task**:\n- **Part A**: Explain why this code will not produce the desired output. How does the format specifier `%d` interact with the percentage symbol `%%` in the string?\n- **Part B**: Propose a corrected version of the code that correctly prints the grade followed by a percent sign (e.g., "85%"). Justify your choice of format specifier based on the text's explanation of format specifiers.\n- **Part C**: Discuss how understanding format specifiers is essential for debugging programs that output formatted data. Provide an example of a common mistake related to format specifiers and explain why it occurs.\n**Answer Requirement**: Your response must integrate the principles of format specifiers as described in the text and demonstrate logical reasoning about string formatting in C.

Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table. \n\n1.3 The for statement\n\nThere are plenty of different ways to write a program for a particular task. Let's try a variation on \nthe temperature converter. \n\n   #include <stdio.h>\n\n   /* print Fahrenheit-Celsius table */\n   main()\n   {\n       int fahr;\n\n       for (fahr = 0; fahr <= 300; fahr = fahr + 20)\n           printf(\"%3d %6.1f\\n\", fahr, (5.0/9.0)*(fahr-32));\n   }\nThis produces the same answers, but it certainly looks different. One major change is the \nelimination of most of the variables; only fahr remains, and we have made it an int. The lower \nand upper limits and the step size appear only as constants in the for statement, itself a new \nconstruction, and the expression that computes the Celsius temperature now appears as the third \nargument of printf instead of a separate assignment statement. \n\nThis last change is an instance of a general rule - in any context where it is permissible to use the \nvalue of some type, you can use a more complicated expression of that type. Since the third \nargument of printf must be a floating-point value to match the %6.1f, any floating-point \nexpression can occur here. \n\nThe for statement is a loop, a generalization of the while. If you compare it to the earlier while, \nits operation should be clear. Within the parentheses, there are three parts, separated by \n\n \n \n \nsemicolons. The first part, the initialization \n\n   fahr = 0\n\nThe text is from The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie."
