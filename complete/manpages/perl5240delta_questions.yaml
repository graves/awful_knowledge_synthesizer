    NAME
           perl5240delta - what is new for perl v5.24.0

    DESCRIPTION
           This document describes the differences between the 5.22.0 release and
           the 5.24.0 release.

    Core Enhancements
       Postfix dereferencing is no longer experimental
           Using the "postderef" and "postderef_qq" features no longer emits a
           warning. Existing code that disables the "experimental::postderef"
           warning category that they previously used will continue to work. The
           "postderef" feature has no effect; all Perl code can use postfix
           dereferencing, regardless of what feature declarations are in scope.
           The 5.24 feature bundle now includes the "postderef_qq" feature.

       Unicode 8.0 is now supported
           For details on what is in this release, see
           <http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/>.

       perl will now croak when closing an in-place output file fails
           Until now, failure to close the output file for an in-place edit was
           not detected, meaning that the input file could be clobbered without
           the edit being successfully completed.  Now, when the output file
           cannot be closed successfully, an exception is raised.

    Manpage text:

    New "\b{lb}" boundary in regular expressions
           "lb" stands for Line Break.  It is a Unicode property that determines
           where a line of text is suitable to break (typically so that it can be
           output without overflowing the available horizontal space).  This
           capability has long been furnished by the Unicode::LineBreak module,
           but now a light-weight, non-customizable version that is suitable for
           many purposes is in core Perl.

       "qr/(?[ ])/" now works in UTF-8 locales
           Extended Bracketed Character Classes now will successfully compile when
           "use locale" is in effect.  The compiled pattern will use standard
           Unicode rules.  If the runtime locale is not a UTF-8 one, a warning is
           raised and standard Unicode rules are used anyway.  No tainting is done
           since the outcome does not actually depend on the locale.

       Integer shift ("<<" and ">>") now more explicitly defined
           Negative shifts are reverse shifts: left shift becomes right shift, and
           right shift becomes left shift.

For example, for the overshift a common C behavior is \"modulo\n       shift\":\n\n\t 1 >> 64 == 1 >> (64 % 64) == 1 >> 0 == 1  # Common C behavior.\n\n\t # And the same for <<, while Perl now produces 0 for both.\n\n       Now these behaviors are well-defined under Perl, regardless of what the\n       underlying C implementation does.  Note, however, that you are still\n       constrained by the native integer width: you need to know how far left\n       you can go.  You can use for example:\n\n\t use Config;\n\t my $wordbits = $Config{uvsize} * 8;  # Or $Config{uvsize} << 3.\n\n       If you need a more bits on the left shift, you can use for example the\n       \"bigint\" pragma, or the \"Bit::Vector\" module from CPAN."

    Manpage text:

    printf and sprintf now allow reordered precision arguments
           That is, "sprintf '|%.*2$d|', 2, 3" now returns "|002|". This extends
           the existing reordering mechanism (which allows reordering for
           arguments that are used as format fields, widths, and vector
           separators).

       More fields provided to "sigaction" callback with "SA_SIGINFO"
           When passing the "SA_SIGINFO" flag to sigaction, the "errno", "status",
           "uid", "pid", "addr" and "band" fields are now included in the hash
           passed to the handler, if supported by the platform.

       Hashbang redirection to Perl 6
           Previously perl would redirect to another interpreter if it found a
           hashbang path unless the path contains "perl" (see perlrun). To improve
           compatibility with Perl 6 this behavior has been extended to also
           redirect if "perl" is followed by "6".

    Security
       Set proper umask before calling mkstemp(3)
           In 5.22 perl started setting umask to 0600 before calling mkstemp(3)
           and restoring it afterwards. This wrongfully tells open(2) to strip the
           owner read and write bits from the given mode before applying it,
           rather than the intended negation of leaving only those bits in place.

    "qr/\b{wb}/" is now tailored to Perl expectations
           This is now more suited to be a drop-in replacement for plain "\b", but
           giving better results for parsing natural language.  Previously it
           strictly followed the current Unicode rules which calls for it to match
           between each white space character.  Now it doesn't generally match
           within spans of white space, behaving like "\b" does.  See "\b{wb}" in
           perlrebackslash

       Regular expression compilation errors
           Some regular expression patterns that had runtime errors now don't
           compile at all.

           Almost all Unicode properties using the "\p{}" and "\P{}" regular
           expression pattern constructs are now checked for validity at pattern
           compilation time, and invalid ones will cause the program to not
           compile.  In earlier releases, this check was often deferred until run
           time.  Whenever an error check is moved from run- to compile time,
           erroneous code is caught 100% of the time, whereas before it would only
           get caught if and when the offending portion actually gets executed,
           which for unreachable code might be never.

    Manpage text:

    The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
           generated from version control history. In particular, it does not
           include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
           reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

           Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
           modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
           community for helping Perl to flourish.

           For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
           please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

    Reporting Bugs
           If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
           recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
           database at https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
           http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

           If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
           program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
           tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
           of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
           the Perl porting team.
