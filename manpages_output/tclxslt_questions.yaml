This allows the application to cache parsed XML documents\n       and compiled XSL stylesheets for better runtime performance.\n\n\nPACKAGES AND NAMESPACES\n       The TclXSLT package defines the\tpackage and also a Tcl namespace using\n       that name.\n\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::xslt::compile\n\n\n       The ::xslt::compile command pre-compiles a stylesheet document.\tIt\n       returns a compiled stylesheet object and also defines a Tcl command to\n       access the stylesheet.  This Tcl command may be used to transform XML\n       documents.\n\n\n       NB.  It is advisable to use the\t-baseuri option when parsing the\n       source and stylesheet documents to allow external resources to be\n       resolved.\n\n\n\n       Stylesheet Command\n\n\n       The stylesheet command created by ::xslt::compile command accesses a\n       compiled stylesheet.\n\n\n       Following is an example of how to use the stylesheet transform method.\n\n\n\t      Command Methods\n\n\n\t      The following command methods may be used:\n\n\n\t\t      cget option\n\n\t\t     Returns the value of an option.  See below for the list\n\t\t     of valid options.\n\n\n\t\t      configure optionvalue\n\n\t\t     Sets the value of an option.  Available options are as\n\t\t     follows:\n\n\n\n\t\t      transform source ? name value?\n\n\t\t     Performs an XSL transformation on the given source\n\t\t     document.\tStylesheet parameters may be specified as\n\t\t     name-value pairs.\tThe return result is the DOM token for\n\t\t     the result document.\n\n\n\t      Stylesheet Parameters\n\n\n\t      Any number of name-value pairs may be specified as arguments to\n\t      the stylesheet transform method.\tThese are passed as values for\n\t      parameters in the stylesheet.   interprets the values as XPath\n\t      expressions, where the context node is the root node for the\n\t      source document.\tTo pass a value as a string it must be XPath-\n\t      quoted, for example\n\n\n\t\t     set library \"Gnome libxslt\"\n\t\t     $ssheet transform $source_doc library '$library' author \"'Daniel Veillard'\" node {/*/Element[3]}\n\n\n\n       ::xslt::extension\n\n\n       The ::xslt::extension command is used to manage extensions of the\n       library.  The add is used to register an extension.  The remove is used\n       to unregister an extension.  See  for more detail."

This means that Tcl scripts may provide the\n       implementation of an XSLT extension element or function.  The binding\n       is achieved to associating a Tcl namespace with an XML namespace.\n\n       Implementing An Extension\n\n\n       The Tcl application uses the ::xslt::extension add command to register\n       an extension.  An XML Namespace for the extension is specified as an\n       argument, along with a Tcl namespace that will provide implementations\n       of extension elements and functions.  For example,\n\n\n       Everytime the ::xslt::transform command is executed, a newly-created\n       XSLT engine is initialized.  For each registered extension, every\n       procedure in the associated Tcl namespace is defined in the XSLT engine\n       as either an extension element or an extension function.  The procedure\n       is defined as an extension function if it has a variable argument list,\n       otherwise it is defined as an extension element.  The procedure name is\n       used as the local part of the extension name.  For example,\n\n\n       \"myfunc\" is defined as an extension function and \"myelement\" is defined\n       as an extension element.\n\n\n\t      Extension Functions\n\n\n\t      The arguments to an extension function are converted to a string\n\t      value and then passed as parameters to the Tcl procedure.\n\n\n\t      The return result of the Tcl procedure becomes the return value\n\t      of the extension function.  The type of the result is preserved\n\t      where possible, otherwise it is converted to a string value.\n\n\t      Extension Elements\n\n\n\t      Extension elements have not been implemented in TclXSLT v1.1.\n\n\n       Using An Extension\n\n\n       To invoke an extension in an XSL stylesheet, use the normal XSLT\n       extension mechanism.  The XML Namespace matches the extension to the\n       registered Tcl namespace (NB. the stylesheet author is free to choose\n       any prefix for the extension namespace).  For example,\n\n\n       This stylesheet would result in the following Tcl script being\n       evaluated:"
