(The process of translating between symbolic\n\t     names and numerical equivalents can be quite time consuming, and\n\t     may require correct operation of the network; thus it may be\n\t     expedient to forget this, especially when attempting to repair\n\t     networking operations)."

    Manpage text:

    A destination of default is a synonym for -net 0.0.0.0, which is the
         default route.

         If the destination is directly reachable via an interface requiring no
         intermediary system to act as a gateway, the -interface modifier should
         be specified; the gateway given is the address of this host on the common
         network, indicating the interface to be used for transmission.
         Alternately, if the interface is point to point the name of the interface
         itself may be given, in which case the route remains valid even if the
         local or remote addresses change.

         For AF_INET and AF_INET6, the -ifscope modifier specifies the additional
         property of the route related to the interface scope derived from
         interface boundif.  Such property allows for the presence of multiple
         route entries with the same destination, where each route is associated
         with a unique interface.  This modifier is required in order to
         manipulate route entries marked with the RTF_IFSCOPE flag.

    Manpage text:

    The optional modifier -link specify that all subsequent addresses are
         specified as link-level addresses, and the names must be numeric
         specifications rather than symbolic names.

         The optional -netmask modifier is intended to achieve the effect of an
         OSI ESIS redirect with the netmask option, or to manually add subnet
         routes with netmasks different from that of the implied network interface
         (as would otherwise be communicated using the OSPF or ISIS routing
         protocols).  One specifies an additional ensuing address parameter (to be
         interpreted as a network mask).  The implicit network mask generated in
         the AF_INET case can be overridden by making sure this option follows the
         destination parameter.

         For AF_INET6, the -prefixlen qualifier is available instead of the -mask
         qualifier because non-continuous masks are not allowed in IPv6.  For
         example, -prefixlen 32 specifies network mask of
         ffff:ffff:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to be used.  The default value of
         prefixlen is 64 to get along with the aggregatable address.  But 0 is
         assumed if default is specified.  Note that the qualifier works only for
         AF_INET6 address family.

    Manpage text:

    In a change or add command where the destination and gateway are not
         sufficient to specify the route (as in the ISO case where several
         interfaces may have the same address), the -ifp or -ifa modifiers may be
         used to determine the interface or interface address.

         The optional -proxy modifier specifies that the RTF_LLINFO routing table
         entry is the “published (proxy-only)” ARP entry, as reported by arp(8).

         All symbolic names specified for a destination or gateway are looked up
         first as a host name using gethostbyname(3).  If this lookup fails,
         getnetbyname(3) is then used to interpret the name as that of a network.

         route uses a routing socket and the new message types RTM_ADD,
         RTM_DELETE, RTM_GET, and RTM_CHANGE.  As such, only the super-user may
         modify the routing tables.

    DIAGNOSTICS
         add [host | network ] %s: gateway %s flags %x  The specified route is
         being added to the tables.  The values printed are from the routing table
         entry supplied in the ioctl(2) call.  If the gateway address used was not
         the primary address of the gateway (the first one returned by
         gethostbyname(3)), the gateway address is printed numerically as well as
         symbolically.
