When options are specified, strings representing one\n     or more system characteristics are written to standard output.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -a      Behave as though the options -m, -n, -r, -s, and -v were\n\t     specified.\n\n     -m      Write the type of the current hardware platform to standard\n\t     output.  (make(1) uses it to set the MACHINE variable.)\n\n     -n      Write the name of the system to standard output.\n\n     -o      This is a synonym for the -s option, for compatibility with other\n\t     systems.\n\n     -p      Write the type of the machine processor architecture to standard\n\t     output.  (make(1) uses it to set the MACHINE_ARCH variable.)\n\n     -r      Write the current release level of the operating system to\n\t     standard output."

These names have a higher priority than their shorter\n     counterparts described in the previous paragraph.\n\n     See uname(3) for more information.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n     The uname utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs."
