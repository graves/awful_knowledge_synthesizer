Such annotations are used by formatting tools\n     to achieve a uniform presentation across all manuals written in mdoc, and\n     to support hyperlinking if supported by the output medium.\n\n     This reference document describes the structure of manual pages and the\n     syntax and usage of the mdoc language.  The reference implementation of a\n     parsing and formatting tool is mandoc(1); the COMPATIBILITY section\n     describes compatibility with other implementations.\n\n     In an mdoc document, lines beginning with the control character ‘.’ are\n     called “macro lines”.  The first word is the macro name.  It consists of\n     two or three letters.  Most macro names begin with a capital letter.  For\n     a list of available macros, see MACRO OVERVIEW.  The words following the\n     macro name are arguments to the macro, optionally including the names of\n     other, callable macros; see MACRO SYNTAX for details."

However, using roff(7) requests in\n     mdoc documents is discouraged; mandoc(1) supports some of them merely for\n     backward compatibility.\n\nMANUAL STRUCTURE\n     A well-formed mdoc document consists of a document prologue followed by\n     one or more sections.\n\n     The prologue, which consists of the Dd, Dt, and Os macros in that order,\n     is required for every document.\n\n     The first section (sections are denoted by Sh) must be the NAME section,\n     consisting of at least one Nm followed by Nd."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `mdoc`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDelimiters\n     When a macro argument consists of one single input character considered\n     as a delimiter, the argument gets special handling.  This does not apply\n     when delimiters appear in arguments containing more than one character.\n     Consequently, to prevent special handling and just handle it like any\n     other argument, a delimiter can be escaped by prepending a zero-width\n     space (‘\\&’).  In text lines, delimiters never need escaping, but may be\n     used as normal punctuation.\n\n     For many macros, when the leading arguments are opening delimiters, these\n     delimiters are put before the macro scope, and when the trailing\n     arguments are closing delimiters, these delimiters are put after the\n     macro scope.  Spacing is suppressed after opening delimiters and before\n     closing delimiters.  For example,\n\n\t   .Aq ( [ word ] ) .\n\n     renders as:\n\n\t   ([⟨word⟩]).\n\n     Opening delimiters are:\n\n\t   (\t   left parenthesis\n\t   [\t   left bracket\n\n     Closing delimiters are:"

For example,\n\n\t   .Fl a ( b | c \\*(Ba d ) e\n\n     renders as:\n\n\t   -a (-b | -c | -d) -e\n\n     This applies to both opening and closing delimiters, and also to the\n     middle delimiter, which does not suppress spacing:\n\n\t   |\t   vertical bar\n\n     As a special case, the predefined string \\*(Ba is handled and rendered in\n     the same way as a plain ‘|’ character.  Using this predefined string is\n     not recommended in new manuals.\n\n     Appending a zero-width space (‘\\&’) to the end of an input line is also\n     useful to prevent the interpretation of a trailing period, exclamation or\n     question mark as the end of a sentence, for example when an abbreviation\n     happens to occur at the end of a text or macro input line."

Manually\n     switching the font using the roff(7) ‘\\f’ font escape sequences is never\n     required.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n     This section provides an incomplete list of compatibility issues between\n     mandoc and GNU troff (\"groff\").\n\n     The following problematic behaviour is found in groff:\n\n     -\t Pa does not format its arguments when used in the FILES section under\n\t certain list types.\n     -\t Ta can only be called by other macros, but not at the beginning of a\n\t line.\n     -\t ‘\\f’ (font face) and ‘\\F’ (font family face) Text Decoration escapes\n\t behave irregularly when specified within line-macro scopes.\n     -\t Negative scaling units return to prior lines.\tInstead, mandoc\n\t truncates them to zero."
