If\n     the message is omitted, it prompts for and reads one line of its standard\n     input.\n\n     The output should be printed on paper of the appropriate width, with no\n     breaks between the pages.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -d      Enable debug.\n\n     -t      Enable trace.\n\n     -w width\n\t     Change the output from a width of 132 to width, suitable for a\n\t     narrow terminal.\n\nHISTORY\n     The banner utility first appeared in AT&T UNIX 6.\n\nAUTHORS\n     Mark Horton\n\nBUGS\n     Several ASCII characters are not defined, notably <, >, [, ], \\, ^, _, {,\n     }, |, and ~.  Also, the characters \", ', and & are funny looking (but in\n     a useful way.)\n\n     The -w option is implemented by skipping some rows and columns.  The\n     smaller it gets, the grainier the output.\tSometimes it runs letters\n     together."
