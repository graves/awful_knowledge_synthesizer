The list of options (also\n     available by running the program without any options) follows:\n\n     tiffutil -none\t\tinfile\t\t\t[-out outfile]\n\t      -lzw\t\tinfile\t\t\t[-out outfile]\n\t      -packbits \tinfile\t\t\t[-out outfile]\n\t      -cat\t\tinfile1 [infile2 ...]\t[-out outfile]\n\t      -catnosizecheck\tinfile1 [infile2 ...]\t[-out outfile]\n\t      -cathidpicheck\tinfile1 [infile2 ...]\t[-out outfile]\n\t      -extract\t\tnum infile\t\t[-out outfile]\n\t      -info\t\tinfile\n\t      -verboseinfo\tinfile\n\t      -dump\t\tinfile\n\n     -none, -lzw, and -packbits options specify the compression format to be\n     applied to the images in the TIFF file.  -none specifies no compression;\n     -packbits specifies PackBits compression; -lzw specifies standard Lempel-\n     Ziv & Welch compression (no prediction scheme)."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the tiffutil command?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use tiffutil to apply PackBits compression to a TIFF file called 'input.tiff' and save the output as 'output.tiff'?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using tiffutil to extract a specific page from a multi-page TIFF file and save it as a new file?

    Manpage text:

    -cat allows combining multiple TIFF files into one.  The images are
         copied without any change in tag values. If the real sizes (pixel size
         divided by dpi) of the images being combined are not the same, a warning
         will be generated. This makes sure that NSImage can successfully choose
         the right size image out of the generated TIFF file. Use -catnosizecheck
         to bypass the size check.

         -cathidpicheck can be used to write an output file conforming to Apple's
         guidelines for resolution independent bitmap images, and will generate
         warnings if the supplied images do not have the recommended size
         relationship. For best results, ensure that the larger file has a
         filename of the form <basename>@2x.png.

         -extract allows extracting an individual image from a TIFF file; specify
         num = 0 for the first image in the file.

         -info prints information about TIFF images. -verboseinfo is the same,
         except most of the tables are displayed in full. -dump simply lists all
         of the tags in the file without trying to interpret them; it is handy
         when trying to figure out why a TIFF file won't load or display properly.

  manpageQuestion2: How can you use tiffutil to combine multiple TIFF files into a single file without checking the size compatibility?
  manpageQuestion3: What command can be used to extract the second image from a TIFF file and save it as a new file?
