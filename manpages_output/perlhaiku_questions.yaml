Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlhaiku`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPERLHAIKU(1)\t       Perl Programmers Reference Guide \t  PERLHAIKU(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       perlhaiku - Perl version 5.10+ on Haiku\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       This file contains instructions how to build Perl for Haiku and lists\n       known problems.\n\nBUILD AND INSTALL\n       The build procedure is completely standard:\n\n\t ./Configure -de\n\t make\n\t make install\n\n       Make perl executable and create a symlink for libperl:\n\n\t chmod a+x /boot/common/bin/perl\n\t cd /boot/common/lib; ln -s perl5/5.34.1/BePC-haiku/CORE/libperl.so .\n\n       Replace 5.34.1 with your respective version of Perl.\n\nKNOWN PROBLEMS\n       The following problems are encountered with Haiku revision 28311:\n\n       •   Perl cannot be compiled with threading support ATM.\n\n       •   The cpan/Socket/t/socketpair.t test fails. More precisely: the\n\t   subtests using datagram sockets fail. Unix datagram sockets aren't\n\t   implemented in Haiku yet.\n\n       •   A subtest of the cpan/Sys-Syslog/t/syslog.t test fails. This is due\n\t   to Haiku not implementing /dev/log support yet.\n\n       •   The tests dist/Net-Ping/t/450_service.t and\n\t   dist/Net-Ping/t/510_ping_udp.t fail. This is due to bugs in Haiku's\n\t   network stack implementation.\n\nCONTACT\n       For Haiku specific problems contact the HaikuPorts developers:\n       <http://ports.haiku-files.org/>\n\n       The initial Haiku port was done by Ingo Weinhold\n       <ingo_weinhold@gmx.de>.\n\n       Last update: 2008-10-29\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2022-02-26\t\t\t  PERLHAIKU(1)"
