By default,\n     zprint will print out information about all Mach zones.  If the optional\n     name is specified, zprint will print information about each zone for\n     which name is a substring of the zone's name.\n\n     zprint interprets the following options:\n\n     -c \t(Default) zprint prints zone info in columns.  Long zone names\n\t\tare truncated with ‘$’, and spaces are replaced with ‘.’, to\n\t\tallow for sorting by column.  Pageable and collectible zones\n\t\tare shown with ‘P’ and ‘C’ on the far right, respectively.\n\t\tZones with preposterously large maximum sizes are shown with\n\t\t‘----’ in the max size and max num elts fields.\n\n     -d \tDisplay deltas over time, showing any zones that have achieved\n\t\ta new maximum current allocation size during the interval.  If\n\t\tthe total allocation sizes are being displayed for the zones\n\t\tin question, it will also display the deltas if the total\n\t\tallocations have doubled."

  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the zprint utility?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use zprint to display only the headings for the columns without showing all wired memory information?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using zprint to sort zones by the amount of memory they waste?
