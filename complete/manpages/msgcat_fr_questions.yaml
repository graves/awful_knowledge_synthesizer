    DESCRIPTION
           The package doctools::msgcat::toc::fr is a support module providing the
           FR (french) language message catalog for the doctoc parser in the
           doctools system version 2. As such it is an internal package a regular
           user (developer) should not be in direct contact with.

           [2]    doctools::toc, or

           Within the system architecture this package resides under the package
           doctools::msgcat providing the general message catalog management
           within the system. Note that there is no explicit dependency between
           the manager and catalog packages. The catalog is a plugin which is
           selected and loaded dynamically.
