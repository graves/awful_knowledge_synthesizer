The -verbose (-v) flag of the\n     tools provides a simple system of levels that apply a set of lower level\n     binary logging flags appropriate to each tool, for maximally useful\n     verbose output.  The binary log specification is used for kernel logging\n     and is also available for use with the -verbose option when you need\n     precise control over logging.\n\nENABLING LOGGING\n     For command-line tools the -verbose (-v) and -quiet (-q) flags control\n     verbose output.  The -verbose flag accepts a decimal level from 0-6 or a\n     hexadecimal log specification, both described below.  The -verbose flag\n     temporarily sets the log spec within the kernel, and captures any log\n     messages from the kernel to print along with the tool's own log messages."

You can set it\n     as root using nvram(8) like so:\n\n\t   nvram boot-args=\"kextlog=0xlogspec other_boot_args\"\n\n     where logspec is a hexadecimal log specification, as described below\n     under “BINARY LOG SPECIFICATION”.\n\n     Caution: Enabling logging at a high level via boot arg can greatly slow\n     down system startup time.\n\n     To change the kextlog setting at any time use sysctl(8):\n\n\t   sysctl -w debug.kextlog=0xlogspec\n\nVERBOSE LEVELS\n     As mentioned, for the command-line kext tools you use the -verbose (-v)\n     flag, which takes an optional argument that is either a decimal level\n     from 0-6, or a hexadecimal log specification (described under “BINARY LOG\n     SPECIFICATION”). The details of each level vary by tool, but in general\n     they are:\n\n     0\t\t  Errors only (that is, suppress warnings).  Tools with a\n\t\t  -verbose flag also support a -quiet flag to suppress all\n\t\t  output."
