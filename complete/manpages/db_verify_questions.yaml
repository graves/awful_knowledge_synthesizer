The -o flag causes\n       db_verify to ignore database sort or hash ordering and allows db_verify\n       to be used on these files. To fully verify these files, verify them\n       explicitly using the DB->verify method, after configuring the correct\n       comparison or hashing functions."

    Manpage text:

    -N
           Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running. Other problems,
           such as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as
           well. This option is intended only for debugging errors, and should not
           be used under any other circumstances.

         -P
           Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities
           overwrite password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a
           window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see
           command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite the
           memory containing the command-line arguments.

         -q
           Suppress the printing of any error descriptions, simply exit success or
           failure.

         -V
           Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

         The db_verify utility does not perform any locking, even in Berkeley DB
         environments that are configured with a locking subsystem. As such, it
         should only be used on files that are not being modified by another
         thread of control.
