Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `bundle-platform`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nBUNDLE-PLATFORM(1)\t\t\t\t\t    BUNDLE-PLATFORM(1)\n\nNAME\n       bundle-platform - Displays platform compatibility information\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       bundle platform [--ruby]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       platform will display information from your Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, and\n       Ruby VM about your platform.\n\n       For instance, using this Gemfile(5):\n\n\n\n\t   source \"https://rubygems.org\"\n\n\t   ruby \"1.9.3\"\n\n\t   gem \"rack\"\n\n\n\n\n       If you run bundle platform on Ruby 1.9.3, it will display the following\n       output:\n\n\n\n\t   Your platform is: x86_64-linux\n\n\t   Your app has gems that work on these platforms:\n\t   * ruby\n\n\t   Your Gemfile specifies a Ruby version requirement:\n\t   * ruby 1.9.3\n\n\t   Your current platform satisfies the Ruby version requirement.\n\n\n\n\n       platform will list all the platforms in your Gemfile.lock as well as\n       the ruby directive if applicable from your Gemfile(5). It will also let\n       you know if the ruby directive requirement has been met. If ruby\n       directive doesn´t match the running Ruby VM, it will tell you what part\n       does not.\n\nOPTIONS\n       --ruby It will display the ruby directive information, so you don´t\n\t      have to parse it from the Gemfile(5).\n\n\n\t\t\t\t November 2018\t\t    BUNDLE-PLATFORM(1)"
