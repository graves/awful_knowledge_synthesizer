Using the\n     getentropy(2) system call interface will provide resiliency to file\n     descriptor exhaustion, chroot, or sandboxing which can make /dev/random\n     unavailable.  Additionally, the arc4random(3) API provides a fast\n     userspace random number generator built on the random data source and is\n     preferred over directly accessing the system's random device.\n\n     /dev/urandom is a compatibility nod to Linux. On Linux, /dev/urandom will\n     produce lower quality output if the entropy pool drains, while\n     /dev/random will prefer to block and wait for additional entropy to be\n     collected.  With Fortuna, this choice and distinction is not necessary,\n     and the two devices behave identically. You may use either."
