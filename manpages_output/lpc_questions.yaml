Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `lpc`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nlpc(8)\t\t\t\t  Apple Inc.\t\t\t\tlpc(8)\n\nNAME\n       lpc - line printer control program (deprecated)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       lpc [ command [ parameter(s) ] ]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       lpc provides limited control over printer and class queues provided by\n       CUPS. It can also be used to query the state of queues.\n\n       If no command is specified on the command-line, lpc displays a prompt\n       and accepts commands from the standard input.\n\n   COMMANDS\n       The lpc program accepts a subset of commands accepted by the Berkeley\n       lpc program of the same name:\n\n       exit Exits the command interpreter.\n\n       help [command]\n\n       ? [command]\n\t    Displays a short help message.\n\n       quit Exits the command interpreter.\n\n       status [queue]\n\t    Displays the status of one or more printer or class queues.\n\nNOTES\n       This program is deprecated and will be removed in a future feature\n       release of CUPS.\n\n       Since lpc is geared towards the Berkeley printing system, it is\n       impossible to use lpc to configure printer or class queues provided by\n       CUPS.  To configure printer or class queues you must use the lpadmin(8)\n       command or another CUPS-compatible client with that functionality."
