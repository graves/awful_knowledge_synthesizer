The following target parameters are interpreted as process\n     ID's (the default), process group ID's, user ID's or user names.  The\n     renice'ing of a process group causes all processes in the process group\n     to have their scheduling priority altered.  The renice'ing of a user\n     causes all processes owned by the user to have their scheduling priority\n     altered.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -n      Instead of changing the specified processes to the given\n\t     priority, interpret the following argument as an increment to be\n\t     applied to the current priority of each process.\n\n     -g      Interpret target parameters as process group ID's.\n\n     -p      Interpret target parameters as process ID's (the default)."

(This prevents overriding administrative\n     fiats.)  The super-user may alter the priority of any process and set the\n     priority to any value in the range PRIO_MIN (-20) to PRIO_MAX.  Useful\n     priorities are: 20 (the affected processes will run only when nothing\n     else in the system wants to), 0 (the ``base'' scheduling priority),\n     anything negative (to make things go very fast).\n\nFILES\n     /etc/passwd  to map user names to user ID's\n\nEXAMPLES\n     Change the priority of process ID's 987 and 32, and all processes owned\n     by users daemon and root.\n\n\t   renice +1 987 -u daemon root -p 32\n\nSEE ALSO\n     nice(1), rtprio(1), getpriority(2), setpriority(2)\n\nSTANDARDS\n     The renice utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”)."
