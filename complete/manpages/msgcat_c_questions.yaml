    DESCRIPTION
           The package doctools::msgcat::toc::c is a support module providing the
           C language message catalog for the doctoc parser in the doctools system
           version 2. As such it is an internal package a regular user (developer)
           should not be in direct contact with.

           [1]    doctools::doc,

           [2]    doctools::toc, or

           [3]    doctools::idx

           Within the system architecture this package resides under the package
           doctools::msgcat providing the general message catalog management
           within the system. Note that there is no explicit dependency between
           the manager and catalog packages. The catalog is a plugin which is
           selected and loaded dynamically.

           This package has no exported API.
