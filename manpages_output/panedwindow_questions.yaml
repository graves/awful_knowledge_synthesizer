Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `panedwindow`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The panedwindow command creates a new window (given by the pathName\n       argument) and makes it into a panedwindow widget.  Additional options,\n       described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option\n       database to configure aspects of the panedwindow such as its default\n       background color and relief.  The panedwindow command returns the path\n       name of the new window.\n\n       A panedwindow widget contains any number of panes, arranged\n       horizontally or vertically, according to the value of the -orient\n       option.\tEach pane contains one widget, and each pair of panes is\n       separated by a moveable (via mouse movements) sash.  Moving a sash\n       causes the widgets on either side of the sash to be resized.\n\nWIDGET COMMAND\n       The panedwindow command creates a new Tcl command whose name is the\n       same as the path name of the panedwindow's window.  This command may be\n       used to invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following\n       general form:\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n       PathName is the name of the command, which is the same as the\n       panedwindow widget's path name.\tOption and the args determine the\n       exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible for\n       panedwindow widgets:"
