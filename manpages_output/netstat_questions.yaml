There are a number of output formats,\n     depending on the options for the information presented.  The first form\n     of the command displays a list of active sockets for each protocol.  The\n     second form presents the contents of one of the other network data\n     structures according to the option selected. Using the third form, with a\n     wait interval specified, netstat will continuously display the\n     information regarding packet traffic on the configured network\n     interfaces.  The fourth form displays statistics for the specified\n     protocol or address family. If a wait interval is specified, the protocol\n     information over the last interval seconds will be displayed.  The fifth\n     form displays per-interface statistics for the specified protocol or\n     address family.  The sixth form displays mbuf(9) statistics.  The seventh\n     form displays routing table for the specified address family.  The eighth\n     form displays routing statistics."

    Manpage text:

    Direct routes are created for each interface attached to the local host;
         the gateway field for such entries shows the address of the outgoing
         interface.  The refcnt field gives the current number of active uses of
         the route.  Connection oriented protocols normally hold on to a single
         route for the duration of a connection while connectionless protocols
         obtain a route while sending to the same destination.  The use field
         provides a count of the number of packets sent using that route.  The
         interface entry indicates the network interface utilized for the route.
         A route which is marked with the RTF_IFSCOPE flag is instantiated for the
         corresponding interface.  A cloning route which is marked with the
         RTF_PROXY flag will not generate new routes that are associated with its
         interface scope.

         When netstat is invoked with the -w option and a wait interval argument,
         it displays a running count of statistics related to network interfaces
         or protocols.  An obsolete version of this option used a numeric
         parameter with no option, and is currently supported for backward
         compatibility.  By default, this display summarizes information for all
         interfaces.  Information for a specific interface may be displayed with
         the -I option.
