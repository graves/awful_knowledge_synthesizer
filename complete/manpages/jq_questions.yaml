For instance, running\n       the command jq ´map(.price) | add´ will take an array of JSON objects\n       as input and return the sum of their \"price\" fields.\n\n       jq can accept text input as well, but by default, jq reads a stream of\n       JSON entities (including numbers and other literals) from stdin.\n       Whitespace is only needed to separate entities such as 1 and 2, and\n       true and false. One or more files may be specified, in which case jq\n       will read input from those instead.\n\n       The options are described in the INVOKING JQ section; they mostly\n       concern input and output formatting. The filter is written in the jq\n       language and specifies how to transform the input file or document.\n\nFILTERS\n       A jq program is a \"filter\": it takes an input, and produces an output.\n       There are a lot of builtin filters for extracting a particular field of\n       an object, or converting a number to a string, or various other\n       standard tasks.\n\n       Filters can be combined in various ways - you can pipe the output of\n       one filter into another filter, or collect the output of a filter into\n       an array.\n\n       Some filters produce multiple results, for instance there´s one that\n       produces all the elements of its input array. Piping that filter into a\n       second runs the second filter for each element of the array. Generally,\n       things that would be done with loops and iteration in other languages\n       are just done by gluing filters together in jq.\n\n       It´s important to remember that every filter has an input and an\n       output. Even literals like \"hello\" or 42 are filters - they take an\n       input but always produce the same literal as output. Operations that\n       combine two filters, like addition, generally feed the same input to\n       both and combine the results. So, you can implement an averaging filter\n       as add / length - feeding the input array both to the add filter and\n       the length filter and then performing the division.\n\n       But that´s getting ahead of ourselves. :) Let´s start with something\n       simpler:\n\nINVOKING JQ\n       jq filters run on a stream of JSON data. The input to jq is parsed as a\n       sequence of whitespace-separated JSON values which are passed through\n       the provided filter one at a time. The output(s) of the filter are\n       written to standard out, again as a sequence of whitespace-separated\n       JSON data.\n\n       Note: it is important to mind the shell´s quoting rules. As a general\n       rule it´s best to always quote (with single-quote characters) the jq\n       program, as too many characters with special meaning to jq are also\n       shell meta-characters. For example, jq \"foo\" will fail on most Unix\n       shells because that will be the same as jq foo, which will generally\n       fail because foo is not defined. When using the Windows command shell\n       (cmd.exe) it´s best to use double quotes around your jq program when\n       given on the command-line (instead of the -f program-file option), but\n       then double-quotes in the jq program need backslash escaping.\n\n       You can affect how jq reads and writes its input and output using some\n       command-line options:\n\n       •   --version:\n\n\t   Output the jq version and exit with zero.\n\n       •   --seq:\n\n\t   Use the application/json-seq MIME type scheme for separating JSON\n\t   texts in jq´s input and output. This means that an ASCII RS (record\n\t   separator) character is printed before each value on output and an\n\t   ASCII LF (line feed) is printed after every output. Input JSON\n\t   texts that fail to parse are ignored (but warned about), discarding\n\t   all subsequent input until the next RS. This mode also parses the\n\t   output of jq without the --seq option.\n\n       •   --stream:\n\n\t   Parse the input in streaming fashion, outputting arrays of path and\n\t   leaf values (scalars and empty arrays or empty objects). For\n\t   example, \"a\" becomes [[],\"a\"], and [[],\"a\",[\"b\"]] becomes [[0],[]],\n\t   [[1],\"a\"], and [[1,0],\"b\"].\n\n\t   This is useful for processing very large inputs. Use this in\n\t   conjunction with filtering and the reduce and foreach syntax to\n\t   reduce large inputs incrementally.\n\n       •   --slurp/-s:\n\n\t   Instead of running the filter for each JSON object in the input,\n\t   read the entire input stream into a large array and run the filter\n\t   just once.\n\n       •   --raw-input/-R:\n\n\t   Don´t parse the input as JSON. Instead, each line of text is passed\n\t   to the filter as a string. If combined with --slurp, then the\n\t   entire input is passed to the filter as a single long string.\n\n       •   --null-input/-n:\n\n\t   Don´t read any input at all! Instead, the filter is run once using\n\t   null as the input. This is useful when using jq as a simple\n\t   calculator or to construct JSON data from scratch.\n\n       •   --compact-output / -c:\n\n\t   By default, jq pretty-prints JSON output. Using this option will\n\t   result in more compact output by instead putting each JSON object\n\t   on a single line.\n\n       •   --tab:\n\n\t   Use a tab for each indentation level instead of two spaces.\n\n       •   --indent n:\n\n\t   Use the given number of spaces (no more than 7) for indentation.\n\n       •   --color-output / -C and --monochrome-output / -M:\n\n\t   By default, jq outputs colored JSON if writing to a terminal. You\n\t   can force it to produce color even if writing to a pipe or a file\n\t   using -C, and disable color with -M.\n\n\t   Colors can be configured with the JQ_COLORS environment variable\n\t   (see below).\n\n       •   --ascii-output / -a:\n\n\t   jq usually outputs non-ASCII Unicode codepoints as UTF-8, even if\n\t   the input specified them as escape sequences (like \"\\u03bc\"). Using\n\t   this option, you can force jq to produce pure ASCII output with\n\t   every non-ASCII character replaced with the equivalent escape\n\t   sequence.\n\n       •   --unbuffered\n\n\t   Flush the output after each JSON object is printed (useful if\n\t   you´re piping a slow data source into jq and piping jq´s output\n\t   elsewhere).\n\n       •   --sort-keys / -S:\n\n\t   Output the fields of each object with the keys in sorted order.\n\n       •   --raw-output / -r:\n\n\t   With this option, if the filter´s result is a string then it will\n\t   be written directly to standard output rather than being formatted\n\t   as a JSON string with quotes. This can be useful for making jq\n\t   filters talk to non-JSON-based systems.\n\n       •   --join-output / -j:\n\n\t   Like -r but jq won´t print a newline after each output.\n\n       •   -f filename / --from-file filename:\n\n\t   Read filter from the file rather than from a command line, like\n\t   awk´s -f option. You can also use ´#´ to make comments.\n\n       •   -Ldirectory / -L directory:\n\n\t   Prepend directory to the search list for modules. If this option is\n\t   used then no builtin search list is used. See the section on\n\t   modules below.\n\n       •   -e / --exit-status:\n\n\t   Sets the exit status of jq to 0 if the last output values was\n\t   neither false nor null, 1 if the last output value was either false\n\t   or null, or 4 if no valid result was ever produced. Normally jq\n\t   exits with 2 if there was any usage problem or system error, 3 if\n\t   there was a jq program compile error, or 0 if the jq program ran.\n\n\t   Another way to set the exit status is with the halt_error builtin\n\t   function.\n\n       •   --arg name value:\n\n\t   This option passes a value to the jq program as a predefined\n\t   variable. If you run jq with --arg foo bar, then $foo is available\n\t   in the program and has the value \"bar\". Note that value will be\n\t   treated as a string, so --arg foo 123 will bind $foo to \"123\".\n\n\t   Named arguments are also available to the jq program as\n\t   $ARGS.named.\n\n       •   --argjson name JSON-text:\n\n\t   This option passes a JSON-encoded value to the jq program as a\n\t   predefined variable. If you run jq with --argjson foo 123, then\n\t   $foo is available in the program and has the value 123.\n\n       •   --slurpfile variable-name filename:\n\n\t   This option reads all the JSON texts in the named file and binds an\n\t   array of the parsed JSON values to the given global variable. If\n\t   you run jq with --argfile foo bar, then $foo is available in the\n\t   program and has an array whose elements correspond to the texts in\n\t   the file named bar.\n\n       •   --argfile variable-name filename:\n\n\t   Do not use. Use --slurpfile instead.\n\n\t   (This option is like --slurpfile, but when the file has just one\n\t   text, then that is used, else an array of texts is used as in\n\t   --slurpfile.)\n\n       •   --args:\n\n\t   Remaining arguments are positional string arguments. These are\n\t   available to the jq program as $ARGS.positional[].\n\n       •   --jsonargs:\n\n\t   Remaining arguments are positional JSON text arguments. These are\n\t   available to the jq program as $ARGS.positional[].\n\n       •   --run-tests [filename]:\n\n\t   Runs the tests in the given file or standard input. This must be\n\t   the last option given and does not honor all preceding options. The\n\t   input consists of comment lines, empty lines, and program lines\n\t   followed by one input line, as many lines of output as are expected\n\t   (one per output), and a terminating empty line. Compilation failure\n\t   tests start with a line containing only \"%%FAIL\", then a line\n\t   containing the program to compile, then a line containing an error\n\t   message to compare to the actual.\n\n\t   Be warned that this option can change backwards-incompatibly."

When given a JSON object (aka\n       dictionary or hash) as input, it produces the value at the key \"foo\",\n       or null if there´s none present.\n\n       A filter of the form .foo.bar is equivalent to .foo|.bar.\n\n       This syntax only works for simple, identifier-like keys, that is, keys\n       that are all made of alphanumeric characters and underscore, and which\n       do not start with a digit.\n\n       If the key contains special characters, you need to surround it with\n       double quotes like this: .\"foo$\", or else .[\"foo$\"].\n\n       For example .[\"foo::bar\"] and .[\"foo.bar\"] work while .foo::bar does\n       not, and .foo.bar means .[\"foo\"].[\"bar\"].\n\n\n\n\t   jq ´.foo´\n\t      {\"foo\": 42, \"bar\": \"less interesting data\"}\n\t   => 42\n\n\t   jq ´.foo´\n\t      {\"notfoo\": true, \"alsonotfoo\": false}\n\t   => null\n\n\t   jq ´.[\"foo\"]´\n\t      {\"foo\": 42}\n\t   => 42"

In all cases these builtins deal\n       exclusively with time in UTC.\n\n       The fromdateiso8601 builtin parses datetimes in the ISO 8601 format to\n       a number of seconds since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). The\n       todateiso8601 builtin does the inverse.\n\n       The fromdate builtin parses datetime strings. Currently fromdate only\n       supports ISO 8601 datetime strings, but in the future it will attempt\n       to parse datetime strings in more formats.\n\n       The todate builtin is an alias for todateiso8601.\n\n       The now builtin outputs the current time, in seconds since the Unix\n       epoch.\n\n       Low-level jq interfaces to the C-library time functions are also\n       provided: strptime, strftime, strflocaltime, mktime, gmtime, and\n       localtime. Refer to your host operating system´s documentation for the\n       format strings used by strptime and strftime. Note: these are not\n       necessarily stable interfaces in jq, particularly as to their\n       localization functionality.\n\n       The gmtime builtin consumes a number of seconds since the Unix epoch\n       and outputs a \"broken down time\" representation of Greenwhich Meridian\n       time as an array of numbers representing (in this order): the year, the\n       month (zero-based), the day of the month (one-based), the hour of the\n       day, the minute of the hour, the second of the minute, the day of the\n       week, and the day of the year -- all one-based unless otherwise stated.\n       The day of the week number may be wrong on some systems for dates\n       before March 1st 1900, or after December 31 2099.\n\n       The localtime builtin works like the gmtime builtin, but using the\n       local timezone setting.\n\n       The mktime builtin consumes \"broken down time\" representations of time\n       output by gmtime and strptime.\n\n       The strptime(fmt) builtin parses input strings matching the fmt\n       argument. The output is in the \"broken down time\" representation\n       consumed by gmtime and output by mktime.\n\n       The strftime(fmt) builtin formats a time (GMT) with the given format.\n       The strflocaltime does the same, but using the local timezone setting.\n\n       The format strings for strptime and strftime are described in typical C\n       library documentation. The format string for ISO 8601 datetime is\n       \"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\".\n\n       jq may not support some or all of this date functionality on some\n       systems.

To pass a value to another part of the\n       program, you´ll need that part of the program to define a variable (as\n       a function parameter, object member, or whatever) in which to place the\n       data.\n\n       It is also possible to define functions in jq, although this is is a\n       feature whose biggest use is defining jq´s standard library (many jq\n       functions such as map and find are in fact written in jq).\n\n       jq has reduction operators, which are very powerful but a bit tricky.\n       Again, these are mostly used internally, to define some useful bits of\n       jq´s standard library.\n\n       It may not be obvious at first, but jq is all about generators (yes, as\n       often found in other languages). Some utilities are provided to help\n       deal with generators.\n\n       Some minimal I/O support (besides reading JSON from standard input, and\n       writing JSON to standard output) is available.\n\n       Finally, there is a module/library system.\n\n   Variable / Symbolic Binding Operator: ... as $identifier | ...\n       In jq, all filters have an input and an output, so manual plumbing is\n       not necessary to pass a value from one part of a program to the next.\n       Many expressions, for instance a + b, pass their input to two distinct\n       subexpressions (here a and b are both passed the same input), so\n       variables aren´t usually necessary in order to use a value twice.\n\n       For instance, calculating the average value of an array of numbers\n       requires a few variables in most languages - at least one to hold the\n       array, perhaps one for each element or for a loop counter. In jq, it´s\n       simply add / length - the add expression is given the array and\n       produces its sum, and the length expression is given the array and\n       produces its length.\n\n       So, there´s generally a cleaner way to solve most problems in jq than\n       defining variables. Still, sometimes they do make things easier, so jq\n       lets you define variables using expression as $variable. All variable\n       names start with $. Here´s a slightly uglier version of the\n       array-averaging example:\n\n\n\n\t   length as $array_length | add / $array_length"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `jq`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nMATH\n       jq currently only has IEEE754 double-precision (64-bit) floating point\n       number support.\n\n       Besides simple arithmetic operators such as +, jq also has most\n       standard math functions from the C math library. C math functions that\n       take a single input argument (e.g., sin()) are available as\n       zero-argument jq functions. C math functions that take two input\n       arguments (e.g., pow()) are available as two-argument jq functions that\n       ignore .. C math functions that take three input arguments are\n       available as three-argument jq functions that ignore ..\n\n       Availability of standard math functions depends on the availability of\n       the corresponding math functions in your operating system and C math\n       library. Unavailable math functions will be defined but will raise an\n       error.\n\n       One-input C math functions: acos acosh asin asinh atan atanh cbrt ceil\n       cos cosh erf erfc exp exp10 exp2 expm1 fabs floor gamma j0 j1 lgamma\n       log log10 log1p log2 logb nearbyint pow10 rint round significand sin\n       sinh sqrt tan tanh tgamma trunc y0 y1.\n\n       Two-input C math functions: atan2 copysign drem fdim fmax fmin fmod\n       frexp hypot jn ldexp modf nextafter nexttoward pow remainder scalb\n       scalbln yn.\n\n       Three-input C math functions: fma.\n\n       See your system´s manual for more information on each of these.\n\nI/O\n       At this time jq has minimal support for I/O, mostly in the form of\n       control over when inputs are read. Two builtins functions are provided\n       for this, input and inputs, that read from the same sources (e.g.,\n       stdin, files named on the command-line) as jq itself. These two\n       builtins, and jq´s own reading actions, can be interleaved with each\n       other.\n\n       Two builtins provide minimal output capabilities, debug, and stderr.\n       (Recall that a jq program´s output values are always output as JSON\n       texts on stdout.) The debug builtin can have application-specific\n       behavior, such as for executables that use the libjq C API but aren´t\n       the jq executable itself. The stderr builtin outputs its input in raw\n       mode to stder with no additional decoration, not even a newline.\n\n       Most jq builtins are referentially transparent, and yield constant and\n       repeatable value streams when applied to constant inputs. This is not\n       true of I/O builtins.\n\n   input\n       Outputs one new input.\n\n   inputs\n       Outputs all remaining inputs, one by one.\n\n       This is primarily useful for reductions over a program´s inputs.\n\n   debug\n       Causes a debug message based on the input value to be produced. The jq\n       executable wraps the input value with [\"DEBUG:\", <input-value>] and\n       prints that and a newline on stderr, compactly. This may change in the\n       future.\n\n   stderr\n       Prints its input in raw and compact mode to stderr with no additional\n       decoration, not even a newline.\n\n   input_filename\n       Returns the name of the file whose input is currently being filtered.\n       Note that this will not work well unless jq is running in a UTF-8\n       locale.\n\n   input_line_number\n       Returns the line number of the input currently being filtered.\n\nSTREAMING\n       With the --stream option jq can parse input texts in a streaming\n       fashion, allowing jq programs to start processing large JSON texts\n       immediately rather than after the parse completes. If you have a single\n       JSON text that is 1GB in size, streaming it will allow you to process\n       it much more quickly.\n\n       However, streaming isn´t easy to deal with as the jq program will have\n       [<path>, <leaf-value>] (and a few other forms) as inputs.\n\n       Several builtins are provided to make handling streams easier.\n\n       The examples below use the streamed form of [0,[1]], which is\n       [[0],0],[[1,0],1],[[1,0]],[[1]].\n\n       Streaming forms include [<path>, <leaf-value>] (to indicate any scalar\n       value, empty array, or empty object), and [<path>] (to indicate the end\n       of an array or object). Future versions of jq run with --stream and\n       -seq may output additional forms such as [\"error message\"] when an\n       input text fails to parse.\n\n   truncate_stream(stream_expression)\n       Consumes a number as input and truncates the corresponding number of\n       path elements from the left of the outputs of the given streaming\n       expression.\n\n\n\n\t   jq ´[1|truncate_stream([[0],1],[[1,0],2],[[1,0]],[[1]])]´\n\t      1\n\t   => [[[0],2],[[0]]]"

If you´re used to programming in languages\n       like Python, Java, Ruby, Javascript, etc. then you can think of it as\n       though jq does a full deep copy of every object before it does the\n       assignment (for performance it doesn´t actually do that, but that´s the\n       general idea).\n\n       This means that it´s impossible to build circular values in jq (such as\n       an array whose first element is itself). This is quite intentional, and\n       ensures that anything a jq program can produce can be represented in\n       JSON.\n\n       All the assignment operators in jq have path expressions on the\n       left-hand side (LHS). The right-hand side (RHS) provides values to set\n       to the paths named by the LHS path expressions.\n\n       Values in jq are always immutable. Internally, assignment works by\n       using a reduction to compute new, replacement values for . that have\n       had all the desired assignments applied to ., then outputting the\n       modified value. This might be made clear by this example: {a:{b:{c:1}}}\n       | (.a.b|=3), .. This will output {\"a\":{\"b\":3}} and {\"a\":{\"b\":{\"c\":1}}}\n       because the last sub-expression, ., sees the original value, not the\n       modified value.\n\n       Most users will want to use modification assignment operators, such as\n       |= or +=, rather than =.\n\n       Note that the LHS of assignment operators refers to a value in .. Thus\n       $var.foo = 1 won´t work as expected ($var.foo is not a valid or useful\n       path expression in .); use $var | .foo = 1 instead.\n\n       Note too that .a,.b=0 does not set .a and .b, but (.a,.b)=0 sets both.\n\n   Update-assignment: |=\n       This is the \"update\" operator ´|=´. It takes a filter on the right-hand\n       side and works out the new value for the property of . being assigned\n       to by running the old value through this expression. For instance,\n       (.foo, .bar) |= .+1 will build an object with the \"foo\" field set to\n       the input´s \"foo\" plus 1, and the \"bar\" field set to the input´s \"bar\"\n       plus 1.\n\n       The left-hand side can be any general path expression; see path().\n\n       Note that the left-hand side of ´|=´ refers to a value in .. Thus\n       $var.foo |= . + 1 won´t work as expected ($var.foo is not a valid or\n       useful path expression in .); use $var | .foo |= . + 1 instead.\n\n       If the right-hand side outputs no values (i.e., empty), then the\n       left-hand side path will be deleted, as with del(path).\n\n       If the right-hand side outputs multiple values, only the first one will\n       be used (COMPATIBILITY NOTE: in jq 1.5 and earlier releases, it used to\n       be that only the last one was used).\n\n\n\n\t   jq ´(..|select(type==\"boolean\")) |= if . then 1 else 0 end´\n\t      [true,false,[5,true,[true,[false]],false]]\n\t   => [1,0,[5,1,[1,[0]],0]]"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `jq`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nArithmetic update-assignment: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=\n       jq has a few operators of the form a op= b, which are all equivalent to\n       a |= . op b. So, += 1 can be used to increment values, being the same\n       as |= . + 1.\n\n\n\n\t   jq ´.foo += 1´\n\t      {\"foo\": 42}\n\t   => {\"foo\": 43}\n\n\n\n\n   Plain assignment: =\n       This is the plain assignment operator. Unlike the others, the input to\n       the right-hand-side (RHS) is the same as the input to the\n       left-hand-side (LHS) rather than the value at the LHS path, and all\n       values output by the RHS will be used (as shown below).\n\n       If the RHS of ´=´ produces multiple values, then for each such value jq\n       will set the paths on the left-hand side to the value and then it will\n       output the modified .. For example, (.a,.b)=range(2) outputs\n       {\"a\":0,\"b\":0}, then {\"a\":1,\"b\":1}. The \"update\" assignment forms (see\n       above) do not do this.\n\n       This example should show the difference between ´=´ and ´|=´:\n\n       Provide input ´{\"a\": {\"b\": 10}, \"b\": 20}´ to the programs:\n\n       .a = .b\n\n       .a |= .b\n\n       The former will set the \"a\" field of the input to the \"b\" field of the\n       input, and produce the output {\"a\": 20, \"b\": 20}. The latter will set\n       the \"a\" field of the input to the \"a\" field´s \"b\" field, producing\n       {\"a\": 10, \"b\": 20}.\n\n       Another example of the difference between ´=´ and ´|=´:\n\n       null|(.a,.b)=range(3)\n\n       outputs ´{\"a\":0,\"b\":0}´, ´{\"a\":1,\"b\":1}´, and ´{\"a\":2,\"b\":2}´, while\n\n       null|(.a,.b)|=range(3)\n\n       outputs just ´{\"a\":0,\"b\":0}´.\n\n   Complex assignments\n       Lots more things are allowed on the left-hand side of a jq assignment\n       than in most languages. We´ve already seen simple field accesses on the\n       left hand side, and it´s no surprise that array accesses work just as\n       well:\n\n\n\n\t   .posts[0].title = \"JQ Manual\""

Modules are files whose names end in\n       .jq.\n\n       Modules imported by a program are searched for in a default search path\n       (see below). The import and include directives allow the importer to\n       alter this path.\n\n       Paths in the a search path are subject to various substitutions.\n\n       For paths starting with \"~/\", the user´s home directory is substituted\n       for \"~\".\n\n       For paths starting with \"$ORIGIN/\", the path of the jq executable is\n       substituted for \"$ORIGIN\".\n\n       For paths starting with \"./\" or paths that are \".\", the path of the\n       including file is substituted for \".\". For top-level programs given on\n       the command-line, the current directory is used.\n\n       Import directives can optionally specify a search path to which the\n       default is appended.\n\n       The default search path is the search path given to the -L command-line\n       option, else [\"~/.jq\", \"$ORIGIN/../lib/jq\", \"$ORIGIN/../lib\"].\n\n       Null and empty string path elements terminate search path processing.\n\n       A dependency with relative path \"foo/bar\" would be searched for in\n       \"foo/bar.jq\" and \"foo/bar/bar.jq\" in the given search path. This is\n       intended to allow modules to be placed in a directory along with, for\n       example, version control files, README files, and so on, but also to\n       allow for single-file modules.\n\n       Consecutive components with the same name are not allowed to avoid\n       ambiguities (e.g., \"foo/foo\").\n\n       For example, with -L$HOME/.jq a module foo can be found in\n       $HOME/.jq/foo.jq and $HOME/.jq/foo/foo.jq.\n\n       If \"$HOME/.jq\" is a file, it is sourced into the main program.\n\n   import RelativePathString as NAME [<metadata>];\n       Imports a module found at the given path relative to a directory in a\n       search path. A \".jq\" suffix will be added to the relative path string.\n       The module´s symbols are prefixed with \"NAME::\".\n\n       The optional metadata must be a constant jq expression. It should be an\n       object with keys like \"homepage\" and so on. At this time jq only uses\n       the \"search\" key/value of the metadata.

A \".jq\" suffix will be\n       added to the relative path string. The module´s symbols are imported\n       into the caller´s namespace as if the module´s content had been\n       included directly.\n\n       The optional metadata must be a constant jq expression.

It´s not required for proper\n       operation. It serves only the purpose of providing metadata that can be\n       read with the modulemeta builtin.\n\n       The metadata must be a constant jq expression. It should be an object\n       with keys like \"homepage\". At this time jq doesn´t use this metadata,\n       but it is made available to users via the modulemeta builtin.\n\n   modulemeta\n       Takes a module name as input and outputs the module´s metadata as an\n       object, with the module´s imports (including metadata) as an array\n       value for the \"deps\" key.\n\n       Programs can use this to query a module´s metadata, which they could\n       then use to, for example, search for, download, and install missing\n       dependencies.\n\nCOLORS\n       To configure alternative colors just set the JQ_COLORS environment\n       variable to colon-delimited list of partial terminal escape sequences\n       like \"1;31\", in this order:\n\n       •   color for null\n\n       •   color for false\n\n       •   color for true\n\n       •   color for numbers\n\n       •   color for strings\n\n       •   color for arrays\n\n       •   color for objects"
