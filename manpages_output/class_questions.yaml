Each\n       class acts as a template for actual objects that can be created.  The\n       class itself is a namespace which contains things common to all\n       objects.  Each object has its own unique bundle of data which contains\n       instances of the \"variables\" defined in the class definition.  Each\n       object also has a built-in variable named \"this\", which contains the\n       name of the object.  Classes can also have \"common\" data members that\n       are shared by all objects in a class.\n\n       Two types of functions can be included in the class definition.\n       \"Methods\" are functions which operate on a specific object, and\n       therefore have access to both \"variables\" and \"common\" data members.\n       \"Procs\" are ordinary procedures in the class namespace, and only have\n       access to \"common\" data members.\n\n       If the body of any method or proc starts with \"@\", it is treated as the\n       symbolic name for a C procedure.  Otherwise, it is treated as a Tcl\n       code script.  See below for details on registering and using C\n       procedures.\n\n       A class can only be defined once, although the bodies of class methods\n       and procs can be defined again and again for interactive debugging.\n       See the body and configbody commands for details.\n\n       Each namespace can have its own collection of objects and classes.  The\n       list of classes available in the current context can be queried using\n       the \"itcl::find classes\" command, and the list of objects, with the\n       \"itcl::find objects\" command.\n\n       A class can be deleted using the \"delete class\" command.  Individual\n       objects can be deleted using the \"delete object\" command."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `class`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nCLASS DEFINITIONS\n       class className definition\n\t      Provides the definition for a class named className.  If the\n\t      class className already exists, or if a command called className\n\t      exists in the current namespace context, this command returns an\n\t      error.  If the class definition is successfully parsed,\n\t      className becomes a command in the current context, handling the\n\t      creation of objects for this class.\n\n       The class definition is evaluated as a series of Tcl statements that\n       define elements within the class.  The following class definition\n       commands are recognized:\n\n\t      inherit baseClass ?baseClass...?\n\t\t     Causes the current class to inherit characteristics from\n\t\t     one or more base classes.\tClasses must have been defined\n\t\t     by a previous class command, or must be available to the\n\t\t     auto-loading facility (see \"AUTO-LOADING\" below).\tA\n\t\t     single class definition can contain no more than one\n\t\t     inherit command.\n\n\t\t     The order of baseClass names in the inherit list affects\n\t\t     the name resolution for class members.  When the same\n\t\t     member name appears in two or more base classes, the base\n\t\t     class that appears first in the inherit list takes\n\t\t     precedence.  For example, if classes \"Foo\" and \"Bar\" both\n\t\t     contain the member \"x\", and if another class has the\n\t\t     \"inherit\" statement:\n\t\t     inherit Foo Bar\n\t      then the name \"x\" means \"Foo::x\".  Other inherited members named\n\t      \"x\" must be referenced with their explicit name, like \"Bar::x\".\n\n\t      constructor args ?init? body\n\t\t     Declares the args argument list and body used for the\n\t\t     constructor, which is automatically invoked whenever an\n\t\t     object is created.\n\n\t\t     Before the body is executed, the optional init statement\n\t\t     is used to invoke any base class constructors that\n\t\t     require arguments.  Variables in the args specification\n\t\t     can be accessed in the init code fragment, and passed to\n\t\t     base class constructors.  After evaluating the init\n\t\t     statement, any base class constructors that have not been\n\t\t     executed are invoked automatically without arguments.\n\t\t     This ensures that all base classes are fully constructed\n\t\t     before the constructor body is executed.  By default,\n\t\t     this scheme causes constructors to be invoked in order\n\t\t     from least- to most-specific.  This is exactly the\n\t\t     opposite of the order that classes are reported by the\n\t\t     info heritage command.\n\n\t\t     If construction is successful, the constructor always\n\t\t     returns the object name-regardless of how the body is\n\t\t     defined-and the object name becomes a command in the\n\t\t     current namespace context.  If construction fails, an\n\t\t     error message is returned.\n\n\t      destructor body\n\t\t     Declares the body used for the destructor, which is\n\t\t     automatically invoked when an object is deleted.  If the\n\t\t     destructor is successful, the object data is destroyed\n\t\t     and the object name is removed as a command from the\n\t\t     interpreter.  If destruction fails, an error message is\n\t\t     returned and the object remains.\n\n\t\t     When an object is destroyed, all destructors in its class\n\t\t     hierarchy are invoked in order from most- to least-\n\t\t     specific.\tThis is the order that the classes are\n\t\t     reported by the \"info heritage\" command, and it is\n\t\t     exactly the opposite of the default constructor order.\n\n\t      method name ?args? ?body?\n\t\t     Declares a method called name.  When the method body is\n\t\t     executed, it will have automatic access to object-\n\t\t     specific variables and common data members.\n\n\t\t     If the args list is specified, it establishes the usage\n\t\t     information for this method.  The body command can be\n\t\t     used to redefine the method body, but the args list must\n\t\t     match this specification.\n\n\t\t     Within the body of another class method, a method can be\n\t\t     invoked like any other command-simply by using its name.\n\t\t     Outside of the class context, the method name must be\n\t\t     prefaced an object name, which provides the context for\n\t\t     the data that it manipulates.  Methods in a base class\n\t\t     that are redefined in the current class, or hidden by\n\t\t     another base class, can be qualified using the\n\t\t     \"className::method\" syntax.\n\n\t      proc name ?args? ?body?\n\t\t     Declares a proc called name.  A proc is an ordinary\n\t\t     procedure within the class namespace.  Unlike a method, a\n\t\t     proc is invoked without referring to a specific object.\n\t\t     When the proc body is executed, it will have automatic\n\t\t     access only to common data members.\n\n\t\t     If the args list is specified, it establishes the usage\n\t\t     information for this proc.  The body command can be used\n\t\t     to redefine the proc body, but the args list must match\n\t\t     this specification.\n\n\t\t     Within the body of another class method or proc, a proc\n\t\t     can be invoked like any other command-simply by using its\n\t\t     name.  In any other namespace context, the proc is\n\t\t     invoked using a qualified name like \"className::proc\".\n\t\t     Procs in a base class that are redefined in the current\n\t\t     class, or hidden by another base class, can also be\n\t\t     accessed via their qualified name.\n\n\t      variable varName ?init? ?config?\n\t\t     Defines an object-specific variable named varName.  All\n\t\t     object-specific variables are automatically available in\n\t\t     class methods.  They need not be declared with anything\n\t\t     like the global command.\n\n\t\t     If the optional init string is specified, it is used as\n\t\t     the initial value of the variable when a new object is\n\t\t     created.  Initialization forces the variable to be a\n\t\t     simple scalar value; uninitialized variables, on the\n\t\t     other hand, can be set within the constructor and used as\n\t\t     arrays.\n\n\t\t     The optional config script is only allowed for public\n\t\t     variables.  If specified, this code fragment is executed\n\t\t     whenever a public variable is modified by the built-in\n\t\t     \"configure\" method.  The config script can also be\n\t\t     specified outside of the class definition using the\n\t\t     configbody command.\n\n\t      common varName ?init?\n\t\t     Declares a common variable named varName.\tCommon\n\t\t     variables reside in the class namespace and are shared by\n\t\t     all objects belonging to the class.  They are just like\n\t\t     global variables, except that they need not be declared\n\t\t     with the usual global command.  They are automatically\n\t\t     visible in all class methods and procs.\n\n\t\t     If the optional init string is specified, it is used as\n\t\t     the initial value of the variable.  Initialization forces\n\t\t     the variable to be a simple scalar value; uninitialized\n\t\t     variables, on the other hand, can be set with subsequent\n\t\t     set and array commands and used as arrays.\n\n\t\t     Once a common data member has been defined, it can be set\n\t\t     using set and array commands within the class definition.\n\t\t     This allows common data members to be initialized as\n\t\t     arrays.  For example:\n\t\t     itcl::class Foo {\n\t\t\t common boolean\n\t\t\t set boolean(true) 1\n\t\t\t set boolean(false) 0\n\t\t     }\n\t      Note that if common data members are initialized within the\n\t      constructor, they get initialized again and again whenever new\n\t      objects are created.\n\n\t      public command ?arg arg ...?\n\n\t      protected command ?arg arg ...?\n\n\t      private command ?arg arg ...?\n\t\t     These commands are used to set the protection level for\n\t\t     class members that are created when command is evaluated.\n\t\t     The command is usually method, proc, variable orcommon,\n\t\t     and the remaining arg's complete the member definition.\n\t\t     However, command can also be a script containing many\n\t\t     different member definitions, and the protection level\n\t\t     will apply to all of the members that are created."

See the\n       CrtCommand man page for details.  Within the procedure, class data\n       members can be accessed like ordinary variables using Tcl_SetVar(),\n       Tcl_GetVar(), Tcl_TraceVar(), etc.  Class methods and procs can be\n       executed like ordinary commands using Tcl_Eval().  [incr Tcl] makes\n       this possible by automatically setting up the context before executing\n       the C procedure.\n\n       This scheme provides a natural migration path for code development.\n       Classes can be developed quickly using Tcl code to implement the\n       bodies.\tAn entire application can be built and tested.\tWhen\n       necessary, individual bodies can be implemented with C code to improve\n       performance."
