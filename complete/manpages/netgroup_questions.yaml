Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `netgroup`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nNETGROUP(5)\t\t      File Formats Manual\t\t   NETGROUP(5)\n\nNAME\n     netgroup â€“ defines network groups\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     netgroup\n\nDESCRIPTION\n     The netgroup file specifies ``netgroups'', which are sets of (host, user,\n     domain) tuples that are to be given similar network access.\n\n     Each line in the file consists of a netgroup name followed by a list of\n     the members of the netgroup.  Each member can be either the name of\n     another netgroup or a specification of a tuple as follows:\n\n\t   (host, user, domain)\n     where the host, user, and domain are character string names for the\n     corresponding component.  Any of the comma separated fields may be empty\n     to specify a ``wildcard'' value or may consist of the string ``-'' to\n     specify ``no valid value''.  The members of the list may be separated by\n     whitespace and/or commas; the ``\\'' character may be used at the end of a\n     line to specify line continuation.  The functions specified in\n     getnetgrent(3) should normally be used to access the netgroup database."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the netgroup resource?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you define a netgroup that includes members from the netgroups 'my_group1' and 'my_group2', along with a specific tuple (host=example.com, user=admin, domain=local)?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of a line in the netgroup file that specifies a wildcard for the domain field and includes multiple members separated by commas?
