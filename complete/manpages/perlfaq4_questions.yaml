    NAME
           perlfaq4 - Data Manipulation

    VERSION
           version 5.20210411

    DESCRIPTION
           This section of the FAQ answers questions related to manipulating
           numbers, dates, strings, arrays, hashes, and miscellaneous data issues.

    Data: Numbers
       Why am I getting long decimals (eg, 19.9499999999999) instead of the
           numbers I should be getting (eg, 19.95)?
           For the long explanation, see David Goldberg's "What Every Computer
           Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic"
           (<http://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse320/Documents/FloatingPoint.pdf>).

           Internally, your computer represents floating-point numbers in binary.
           Digital (as in powers of two) computers cannot store all numbers
           exactly. Some real numbers lose precision in the process. This is a
           problem with how computers store numbers and affects all computer
           languages, not just Perl.

           perlnumber shows the gory details of number representations and
           conversions.

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfaq4`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nTo limit the number of decimal places in your numbers, you can use the\n       \"printf\" or \"sprintf\" function. See \"Floating-point Arithmetic\" in\n       perlop for more details.\n\n\t   printf \"%.2f\", 10/3;\n\n\t   my $number = sprintf \"%.2f\", 10/3;\n\n   Why is int() broken?\n       Your \"int()\" is most probably working just fine. It's the numbers that\n       aren't quite what you think.\n\n       First, see the answer to \"Why am I getting long decimals (eg,\n       19.9499999999999) instead of the numbers I should be getting (eg,\n       19.95)?\".\n\n       For example, this\n\n\t   print int(0.6/0.2-2), \"\\n\";\n\n       will in most computers print 0, not 1, because even such simple numbers\n       as 0.6 and 0.2 cannot be presented exactly by floating-point numbers.\n       What you think in the above as 'three' is really more like\n       2.9999999999999995559.\n\n   Why isn't my octal data interpreted correctly?\n       (contributed by brian d foy)\n\n       You're probably trying to convert a string to a number, which Perl only\n       converts as a decimal number. When Perl converts a string to a number,\n       it ignores leading spaces and zeroes, then assumes the rest of the\n       digits are in base 10:"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfaq4`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nmy $string = '0644';\n\n\t   print $string + 0;  # prints 644\n\n\t   print $string + 44; # prints 688, certainly not octal!\n\n       This problem usually involves one of the Perl built-ins that has the\n       same name a Unix command that uses octal numbers as arguments on the\n       command line. In this example, \"chmod\" on the command line knows that\n       its first argument is octal because that's what it does:\n\n\t   %prompt> chmod 644 file\n\n       If you want to use the same literal digits (644) in Perl, you have to\n       tell Perl to treat them as octal numbers either by prefixing the digits\n       with a 0 or using \"oct\":\n\n\t   chmod(     0644, $filename );  # right, has leading zero\n\t   chmod( oct(644), $filename );  # also correct\n\n       The problem comes in when you take your numbers from something that\n       Perl thinks is a string, such as a command line argument in @ARGV:\n\n\t   chmod( $ARGV[0],\t $filename );  # wrong, even if \"0644\"\n\n\t   chmod( oct($ARGV[0]), $filename );  # correct, treat string as octal"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfaq4`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nYou can always check the value you're using by printing it in octal\n       notation to ensure it matches what you think it should be. Print it in\n       octal  and decimal format:\n\n\t   printf \"0%o %d\", $number, $number;\n\n   Does Perl have a round() function? What about ceil() and floor()? Trig\n       functions?\n       Remember that \"int()\" merely truncates toward 0. For rounding to a\n       certain number of digits, \"sprintf()\" or \"printf()\" is usually the\n       easiest route.\n\n\t   printf(\"%.3f\", 3.1415926535);   # prints 3.142\n\n       The POSIX module (part of the standard Perl distribution) implements\n       \"ceil()\", \"floor()\", and a number of other mathematical and\n       trigonometric functions.\n\n\t   use POSIX;\n\t   my $ceil   = ceil(3.5);   # 4\n\t   my $floor  = floor(3.5);  # 3\n\n       In 5.000 to 5.003 perls, trigonometry was done in the Math::Complex\n       module. With 5.004, the Math::Trig module (part of the standard Perl\n       distribution) implements the trigonometric functions. Internally it\n       uses the Math::Complex module and some functions can break out from the\n       real axis into the complex plane, for example the inverse sine of 2."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfaq4`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nRounding in financial applications can have serious implications, and\n       the rounding method used should be specified precisely. In these cases,\n       it probably pays not to trust whichever system of rounding is being\n       used by Perl, but instead to implement the rounding function you need\n       yourself.\n\n       To see why, notice how you'll still have an issue on half-way-point\n       alternation:\n\n\t   for (my $i = -5; $i <= 5; $i += 0.5) { printf \"%.0f \",$i }\n\n\t   -5 -4 -4 -4 -3 -2 -2 -2 -1 -0 0 0 1 2 2 2 3 4 4 4 5\n\n       Don't blame Perl. It's the same as in C. IEEE says we have to do this.\n       Perl numbers whose absolute values are integers under 2**31 (on 32-bit\n       machines) will work pretty much like mathematical integers.  Other\n       numbers are not guaranteed.\n\n   How do I convert between numeric representations/bases/radixes?\n       As always with Perl there is more than one way to do it. Below are a\n       few examples of approaches to making common conversions between number\n       representations. This is intended to be representational rather than\n       exhaustive."

The operators treat a string as a series of\n       bits and work with that (the string \"3\" is the bit pattern 00110011).\n       The operators work with the binary form of a number (the number 3 is\n       treated as the bit pattern 00000011).\n\n       So, saying \"11 & 3\" performs the \"and\" operation on numbers (yielding\n       3).

       Does Perl have anything like Ruby's #{} or Python's f string?
           Unlike the others, Perl allows you to embed a variable naked in a
           double quoted string, e.g. "variable $variable". When there isn't
           whitespace or other non-word characters following the variable name,
           you can add braces (e.g. "foo ${foo}bar") to ensure correct parsing.

           An array can also be embedded directly in a string, and will be
           expanded by default with spaces between the elements. The default
           LIST_SEPARATOR can be changed by assigning a different string to the
           special variable $", such as "local $" = ', ';".

           Perl also supports references within a string providing the equivalent
           of the features in the other two languages.

           "${\ ... }" embedded within a string will work for most simple
           statements such as an object->method call. More complex code can be
           wrapped in a do block "${\ do{...} }".

           When you want a list to be expanded per $", use "@{[ ... ]}".

An array can supply its\n       collection for list operations, so list operations also work on arrays:\n\n\t   # slices\n\t   ( 'dog', 'cat', 'bird' )[2,3];\n\t   @animals[2,3];\n\n\t   # iteration\n\t   foreach ( qw( dog cat bird ) ) { ... }\n\t   foreach ( @animals ) { ... }\n\n\t   my @three = grep { length == 3 } qw( dog cat bird );\n\t   my @three = grep { length == 3 } @animals;\n\n\t   # supply an argument list\n\t   wash_animals( qw( dog cat bird ) );\n\t   wash_animals( @animals );\n\n       Array operations, which change the scalars, rearrange them, or add or\n       subtract some scalars, only work on arrays. These can't work on a list,\n       which is fixed. Array operations include \"shift\", \"unshift\", \"push\",\n       \"pop\", and \"splice\"."

    Manpage text:

    The difference is the sigil, that special character in front of the
           array name. The "$" sigil means "exactly one item", while the "@" sigil
           means "zero or more items". The "$" gets you a single scalar, while the
           "@" gets you a list.

           The confusion arises because people incorrectly assume that the sigil
           denotes the variable type.

           The $array[1] is a single-element access to the array. It's going to
           return the item in index 1 (or undef if there is no item there).  If
           you intend to get exactly one element from the array, this is the form
           you should use.

           The @array[1] is an array slice, although it has only one index.  You
           can pull out multiple elements simultaneously by specifying additional
           indices as a list, like @array[1,4,3,0].

           Using a slice on the lefthand side of the assignment supplies list
           context to the righthand side. This can lead to unexpected results.
           For instance, if you want to read a single line from a filehandle,
           assigning to a scalar value is fine:

    How can I always keep my hash sorted?
           You can look into using the "DB_File" module and "tie()" using the
           $DB_BTREE hash bindings as documented in "In Memory Databases" in
           DB_File. The Tie::IxHash module from CPAN might also be instructive.
           Although this does keep your hash sorted, you might not like the
           slowdown you suffer from the tie interface. Are you sure you need to do
           this? :)

       What's the difference between "delete" and "undef" with hashes?
           Hashes contain pairs of scalars: the first is the key, the second is
           the value. The key will be coerced to a string, although the value can
           be any kind of scalar: string, number, or reference. If a key $key is
           present in %hash, "exists($hash{$key})" will return true. The value for
           a given key can be "undef", in which case $hash{$key} will be "undef"
           while "exists $hash{$key}" will return true. This corresponds to ($key,
           "undef") being in the hash.

    How can I use a reference as a hash key?
           (contributed by brian d foy and Ben Morrow)

           Hash keys are strings, so you can't really use a reference as the key.
           When you try to do that, perl turns the reference into its stringified
           form (for instance, "HASH(0xDEADBEEF)"). From there you can't get back
           the reference from the stringified form, at least without doing some
           extra work on your own.

           Remember that the entry in the hash will still be there even if the
           referenced variable  goes out of scope, and that it is entirely
           possible for Perl to subsequently allocate a different variable at the
           same address. This will mean a new variable might accidentally be
           associated with the value for an old.

           If you have Perl 5.10 or later, and you just want to store a value
           against the reference for lookup later, you can use the core
           Hash::Util::Fieldhash module. This will also handle renaming the keys
           if you use multiple threads (which causes all variables to be
           reallocated at new addresses, changing their stringification), and
           garbage-collecting the entries when the referenced variable goes out of
           scope.

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlfaq4`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nHow do I print out or copy a recursive data structure?\n       The Data::Dumper module on CPAN (or the 5.005 release of Perl) is great\n       for printing out data structures. The Storable module on CPAN (or the\n       5.8 release of Perl), provides a function called \"dclone\" that\n       recursively copies its argument.\n\n\t   use Storable qw(dclone);\n\t   $r2 = dclone($r1);\n\n       Where $r1 can be a reference to any kind of data structure you'd like.\n       It will be deeply copied. Because \"dclone\" takes and returns\n       references, you'd have to add extra punctuation if you had a hash of\n       arrays that you wanted to copy.\n\n\t   %newhash = %{ dclone(\\%oldhash) };\n\n   How do I define methods for every class/object?\n       (contributed by Ben Morrow)\n\n       You can use the \"UNIVERSAL\" class (see UNIVERSAL). However, please be\n       very careful to consider the consequences of doing this: adding methods\n       to every object is very likely to have unintended consequences. If\n       possible, it would be better to have all your object inherit from some\n       common base class, or to use an object system like Moose that supports\n       roles."

    Manpage text:

    How do I verify a credit card checksum?
           Get the Business::CreditCard module from CPAN.

       How do I pack arrays of doubles or floats for XS code?
           The arrays.h/arrays.c code in the PGPLOT module on CPAN does just this.
           If you're doing a lot of float or double processing, consider using the
           PDL module from CPAN instead--it makes number-crunching easy.

           See <https://metacpan.org/release/PGPLOT> for the code.
