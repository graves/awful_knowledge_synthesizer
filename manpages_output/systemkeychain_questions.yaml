The new keychain is empty. If the optional password\n\t     argument is given, the keychain can be also be unlocked with\n\t     that; otherwise, the keychain has no password and can only be\n\t     unlocked by the system.  The optional password option is\n\t     generally used for testing purposes, and using it is not\n\t     recommended."

Chains of keychain unlocks can be setup in this manner to\n     make a series of keychains unlock while only needing to manually unlock\n     the first one.  This functionality can be verified with the -t (test\n     unlock) option."
