In terms of the function-class parameter,\n     these are “auth” and “session” respectively.  The Environment PAM module\n     has identical support for both supported function classes.\n\n     The Environment PAM module allows the setting and unsetting of\n     environment variables.  The use of previously set environment variables\n     as well as PAM_ITEMs such as PAM_RHOST is supported.\n\n     This module can also parse a file with simple KEY=VAL pairs on separate\n     lines (/etc/environment by default).  You can change the default file to\n     parse, with the envfile flag and turn it on or off by setting the readenv\n     flag to 1 or 0 respectively.\n\n     The following options may be passed to this module:"

  manpageQuestion2: How would you configure the pam_env module to read environment variables from a custom file named /etc/custom_env?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the pam_env module to set and unset environment variables during authentication?
