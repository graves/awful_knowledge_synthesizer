The process manages\n     a queue of download requests that are serialized to the underlying\n     Software Update SPI, allowing the Speech and Dictation preference panes\n     to present appropriate progress UI and error alerts. The process is also\n     scheduled to run once a week to  remove any purged assets, such as voices\n     that have been marked by a client as no longer needed.\n\nmacOS 15.3\t\t\t April 1, 2017\t\t\t    macOS 15.3"
