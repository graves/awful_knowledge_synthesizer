All it\n       does is picking options from the command line and calling\n       DBI::ProxyServer::main(). See DBI::ProxyServer for details.\n\n       Available options include:\n\n       --chroot=dir\n\t   (UNIX only)\tAfter doing a bind(), change root directory to the\n\t   given directory by doing a chroot(). This is useful for security,\n\t   but it restricts the environment a lot. For example, you need to\n\t   load DBI drivers in the config file or you have to create hard\n\t   links to Unix sockets, if your drivers are using them. For example,\n\t   with MySQL, a config file might contain the following lines:\n\n\t       my $rootdir = '/var/dbiproxy';\n\t       my $unixsockdir = '/tmp';\n\t       my $unixsockfile = 'mysql.sock';\n\t       foreach $dir ($rootdir, \"$rootdir$unixsockdir\") {\n\t\t   mkdir 0755, $dir;\n\t       }\n\t       link(\"$unixsockdir/$unixsockfile\",\n\t\t    \"$rootdir$unixsockdir/$unixsockfile\");\n\t       require DBD::mysql;\n\n\t       {\n\t\t   'chroot' => $rootdir,\n\t\t   ...\n\t       }\n\n\t   If you don't know chroot(), think of an FTP server where you can\n\t   see a certain directory tree only after logging in. See also the\n\t   --group and --user options.\n\n       --configfile=file\n\t   Config files are assumed to return a single hash ref that overrides\n\t   the arguments of the new method. However, command line arguments in\n\t   turn take precedence over the config file. See the \"CONFIGURATION\n\t   FILE\" section in the DBI::ProxyServer documentation for details on\n\t   the config file.\n\n       --debug\n\t   Turn debugging mode on. Mainly this asserts that logging messages\n\t   of level \"debug\" are created.\n\n       --facility=mode\n\t   (UNIX only) Facility to use for Sys::Syslog. The default is daemon.\n\n       --group=gid\n\t   After doing a bind(), change the real and effective GID to the\n\t   given.  This is useful, if you want your server to bind to a\n\t   privileged port (<1024), but don't want the server to execute as\n\t   root. See also the --user option.\n\n\t   GID's can be passed as group names or numeric values.\n\n       --localaddr=ip\n\t   By default a daemon is listening to any IP number that a machine\n\t   has. This attribute allows one to restrict the server to the given\n\t   IP number.\n\n       --localport=port\n\t   This attribute sets the port on which the daemon is listening. It\n\t   must be given somehow, as there's no default.\n\n       --logfile=file\n\t   Be default logging messages will be written to the syslog (Unix) or\n\t   to the event log (Windows NT). On other operating systems you need\n\t   to specify a log file. The special value \"STDERR\" forces logging to\n\t   stderr. See Net::Daemon::Log for details.\n\n       --mode=modename\n\t   The server can run in three different modes, depending on the\n\t   environment.\n\n\t   If you are running Perl 5.005 and did compile it for threads, then\n\t   the server will create a new thread for each connection. The thread\n\t   will execute the server's Run() method and then terminate. This\n\t   mode is the default, you can force it with \"--mode=threads\".\n\n\t   If threads are not available, but you have a working fork(), then\n\t   the server will behave similar by creating a new process for each\n\t   connection.\tThis mode will be used automatically in the absence of\n\t   threads or if you use the \"--mode=fork\" option.\n\n\t   Finally there's a single-connection mode: If the server has\n\t   accepted a connection, he will enter the Run() method. No other\n\t   connections are accepted until the Run() method returns (if the\n\t   client disconnects).  This operation mode is useful if you have\n\t   neither threads nor fork(), for example on the Macintosh. For\n\t   debugging purposes you can force this mode with \"--mode=single\".\n\n       --pidfile=file\n\t   (UNIX only) If this option is present, a PID file will be created\n\t   at the given location. Default is to not create a pidfile.\n\n       --user=uid\n\t   After doing a bind(), change the real and effective UID to the\n\t   given.  This is useful, if you want your server to bind to a\n\t   privileged port (<1024), but don't want the server to execute as\n\t   root. See also the --group and the --chroot options.\n\n\t   UID's can be passed as group names or numeric values.\n\n       --version\n\t   Suppresses startup of the server; instead the version string will\n\t   be printed and the program exits immediately.\n\nAUTHOR\n\t   Copyright (c) 1997\t Jochen Wiedmann\n\t\t\t\t Am Eisteich 9\n\t\t\t\t 72555 Metzingen\n\t\t\t\t Germany\n\n\t\t\t\t Email: joe@ispsoft.de\n\t\t\t\t Phone: +49 7123 14881\n\n       The DBI::ProxyServer module is free software; you can redistribute it\n       and/or modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.

  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the dbiproxy tool?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you configure dbiproxy to run in single-connection mode and specify a custom log file for debugging?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using dbiproxy with the --chroot option to isolate the server's environment securely?
