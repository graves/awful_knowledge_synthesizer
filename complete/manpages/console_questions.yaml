It is implemented as a separate interpreter with the Tk\n       toolkit loaded, and control over this interpreter is given through the\n       console command.  The behaviour of the console window is defined mainly\n       through the contents of the console.tcl file in the Tk library. Except\n       for TkAqua, this command is not available when Tk is loaded into a\n       tclsh interpreter with “package require Tk”, as a conventional terminal\n       is expected to be present in that case.\tIn TkAqua, this command is ony\n       available when stdin is /dev/null (as is the case e.g. when the\n       application embedding Tk is started from the Mac OS X Finder)."

The first argument is the\n       name of the channel being written to, and the second argument is the\n       string being written to the channel (after encoding and end-of-line\n       translation processing has been performed.)"
