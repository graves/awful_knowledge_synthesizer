The -v option causes mkextunpack to print the name if each kext\n     as it finds them.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n     mkextunpack exits with a zero status upon success.  Upon failure, it\n     prints an error message and exits with a nonzero status.\n\n     With a nonsegreated format 1 mkext file, wherein each kext may contain a\n     universal binary, mkextunpack simply unpacks the contents.  With an mkext\n     file segregated by architecture (that is, with distinct internal archives\n     of architecture-specific kexts), mkextunpack attempts by default to\n     unpack or list kexts for the current machine's architecture.  To choose a\n     particular architecture to extract or list, use the -a option."

    Manpage text:

    There is no simple way to unpack a segregated mkext file into a set of
         kexts with universal binaries, but you can unpack each of its component
         architectures to separate directories for examination.

    BUGS
         Many single-letter options are inconsistent in meaning with (or directly
         contradictory to) the same letter options in other kext tools.

         For version 1 mkext files, note that the file format doesn't record the
         original filenames of the kexts, so mkextunpack has to guess at what they
         are.  It does this by using the value of the CFBundleExecutable property
         of the kext's info dictionary (Project Builder sets this to the base name
         of the kext bundle by default, but the developer can change it).  If that
         property doesn't exist, the last component of the CFBundleIdentifier is
         used.  Duplicates have an incrementing index appended to the name.  Kexts
         that have no CFBundleExecutable or CFBundleIdentifier property are named
         “NameUnknown-n.kext”, where n is a number.

  manpageQuestion2: How would you use mkextunpack to unpack a segregated mkext file into individual kexts for each architecture?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you explain how mkextunpack determines the names of the kexts when the CFBundleExecutable property is not present?
