It opens the slapd.conf(5) configuration file or the\n       slapd-config(5) backend, reads in the authz-policy/olcAuthzPolicy and\n       authz-regexp/olcAuthzRegexp directives, and then parses the ID list\n       given on the command-line.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -d_debug-level\n\t      enable debugging messages as defined by the specified\n\t      debug-level; see slapd(8) for details.\n\n       -f_slapd.conf\n\t      specify an alternative slapd.conf(5) file.\n\n       -F_confdir\n\t      specify a config directory.  If both -f and -F are specified,\n\t      the config file will be read and converted to config directory\n\t      format and written to the specified directory.  If neither\n\t      option is specified, an attempt to read the default config\n\t      directory will be made before trying to use the default config\n\t      file. If a valid config directory exists then the default config\n\t      file is ignored.\n\n       -M_mech\n\t      specify a mechanism.\n\n       -o_option[=value]\n\t      Specify an option with a(n optional) value.  Possible generic\n\t      options/values are:\n\n\t\t     syslog=<subsystems>  (see `-s' in slapd(8))\n\t\t     syslog-level=<level> (see `-S' in slapd(8))\n\t\t     syslog-user=<user>   (see `-l' in slapd(8))"
