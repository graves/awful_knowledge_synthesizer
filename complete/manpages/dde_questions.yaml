Dynamic Data Exchange is\n       a mechanism where applications can exchange raw data. Each DDE\n       transaction needs a service name and a topic. Both the service name and\n       topic are application defined; Tcl uses the service name TclEval, while\n       the topic name is the name of the interpreter given by dde servername.\n       Other applications have their own service names and topics. For\n       instance, Microsoft Excel has the service name Excel.\n\nDDE COMMANDS\n       The following commands are a subset of the full Dynamic Data Exchange\n       set of commands.\n\n       dde servername ?-force? ?-handler proc? ?--? ?topic?\n\t      dde servername registers the interpreter as a DDE server with\n\t      the service name TclEval and the topic name specified by topic.\n\t      If no topic is given, dde servername returns the name of the\n\t      current topic or the empty string if it is not registered as a\n\t      service. If the given topic name is already in use, then a\n\t      suffix of the form “ #2” or “ #3” is appended to the name to\n\t      make it unique. The command's result will be the name actually\n\t      used. The -force option is used to force registration of\n\t      precisely the given topic name.\n\n\t      The -handler option specifies a Tcl procedure that will be\n\t      called to process calls to the dde server. If the package has\n\t      been loaded into a safe interpreter then a -handler procedure\n\t      must be defined. The procedure is called with all the arguments\n\t      provided by the remote call.\n\n       dde execute ?-async? service topic data\n\t      dde execute takes the data and sends it to the server indicated\n\t      by service with the topic indicated by topic. Typically, service\n\t      is the name of an application, and topic is a file to work on.\n\t      The data field is given to the remote application.  Typically,\n\t      the application treats the data field as a script, and the\n\t      script is run in the application.  The -async option requests\n\t      asynchronous invocation.\tThe command returns an error message\n\t      if the script did not run, unless the -async flag was used, in\n\t      which case the command returns immediately with no error.\n\n       dde poke service topic item data\n\t      dde poke passes the data to the server indicated by service\n\t      using the topic and item specified.  Typically, service is the\n\t      name of an application.  topic is application specific but can\n\t      be a command to the server or the name of a file to work on.\n\t      The item is also application specific and is often not used, but\n\t      it must always be non-null.  The data field is given to the\n\t      remote application.\n\n       dde request ?-binary? service topic item\n\t      dde request is typically used to get the value of something; the\n\t      value of a cell in Microsoft Excel or the text of a selection in\n\t      Microsoft Word. service is typically the name of an application,\n\t      topic is typically the name of the file, and item is\n\t      application-specific. The command returns the value of item as\n\t      defined in the application.  Normally this is interpreted to be\n\t      a string with terminating null.  If -binary is specified, the\n\t      result is returned as a byte array.\n\n       dde services service topic\n\t      dde services returns a list of service-topic pairs that\n\t      currently exist on the machine. If service and topic are both\n\t      empty strings ({}), then all service-topic pairs currently\n\t      available on the system are returned. If service is empty and\n\t      topic is not, then all services with the specified topic are\n\t      returned. If service is non-empty and topic is, all topics for a\n\t      given service are returned. If both are non-empty, if that\n\t      service-topic pair currently exists, it is returned; otherwise,\n\t      an empty string is returned.\n\n       dde eval ?-async? topic cmd ?arg arg ...?\n\t      dde eval evaluates a command and its arguments using the\n\t      interpreter specified by topic. The DDE service must be the\n\t      TclEval service.\tThe -async option requests asynchronous\n\t      invocation.  The command returns an error message if the script\n\t      did not run, unless the -async flag was used, in which case the\n\t      command returns immediately with no error.  This command can be\n\t      used to replace send on Windows.\n\nDDE AND TCL\n       A Tcl interpreter always has a service name of TclEval.\tEach different\n       interpreter of all running Tcl applications must be given a unique name\n       specified by dde servername. Each interp is available as a DDE topic\n       only if the dde servername command was used to set the name of the\n       topic for each interp. So a dde services TclEval {} command will return\n       a list of service-topic pairs, where each of the currently running\n       interps will be a topic.\n\n       When Tcl processes a dde execute command, the data for the execute is\n       run as a script in the interp named by the topic of the dde execute\n       command.\n\n       When Tcl processes a dde request command, it returns the value of the\n       variable given in the dde command in the context of the interp named by\n       the dde topic. Tcl reserves the variable $TCLEVAL$EXECUTE$RESULT for\n       internal use, and dde request commands for that variable will give\n       unpredictable results.\n\n       An external application which wishes to run a script in Tcl should have\n       that script store its result in a variable, run the dde execute\n       command, and the run dde request to get the value of the variable.\n\n       When using DDE, be careful to ensure that the event queue is flushed\n       using either update or vwait.  This happens by default when using wish\n       unless a blocking command is called (such as exec without adding the &\n       to place the process in the background).  If for any reason the event\n       queue is not flushed, DDE commands may hang until the event queue is\n       flushed.  This can create a deadlock situation.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       This asks Internet Explorer (which must already be running) to go to a\n       particularly important website:\n\t      package require dde\n\t      dde execute iexplore WWW_OpenURL http://www.tcl.tk/\n\nSEE ALSO\n       tk(n), winfo(n), send(n)\n\nKEYWORDS\n       application, dde, name, remote execution\n\ndde\t\t\t\t      1.3\t\t\t\tdde(n)"
