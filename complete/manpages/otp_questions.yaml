This system uses message-digest\n       algorithms to sequentially hash a passphrase to create single-use\n       passwords. The resulting data is then provided to the user as either\n       hexadecimal digits or encoded using a dictionary of 2048 words. This\n       system is used by OpenBSD for secure login and can be used as a SASL\n       mechanism for authenticating users.\n\n       In this implementation we provide support for four algorithms that are\n       included in the tcllib distribution: MD5 (2), MD4 (3), RIPE-MD160 (4)\n       and SHA-1 (5).\n\nCOMMANDS\n       ::otp::otp-md4 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data\n\n       ::otp::otp-md5 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data\n\n       ::otp::otp-sha1 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data\n\n       ::otp::otp-rmd160 ?-hex? ?-words? -seed seed -count count data\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n       % otp::otp-md5 -count 99 -seed host67821 \"My Secret Pass Phrase\"\n       (binary gibberish)\n       % otp::otp-md5 -words -count 99 -seed host67821 \"My Secret Pass Phrase\"\n       SOON ARAB BURG LIMB FILE WAD\n       % otp::otp-md5 -hex -count 99 -seed host67821 \"My Secret Pass Phrase\"\n       e249b58257c80087"
