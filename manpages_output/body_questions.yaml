Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `body`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nbody(n) \t\t\t  [incr Tcl]\t\t\t       body(n)\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nNAME\n       body - change the body for a class method/proc\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       itcl::body className::function args body\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The body command is used outside of an [incr Tcl] class definition to\n       define or redefine the body of a class method or proc.  This facility\n       allows a class definition to have separate \"interface\" and\n       \"implementation\" parts.\tThe \"interface\" part is a class command with\n       declarations for methods, procs, instance variables and common\n       variables.  The \"implementation\" part is a series of body and\n       configbody commands.  If the \"implementation\" part is kept in a\n       separate file, it can be sourced again and again as bugs are fixed, to\n       support interactive development.  When using the \"tcl\" mode in the\n       emacs editor, the \"interface\" and \"implementation\" parts can be kept in\n       the same file; as bugs are fixed, individual bodies can be highlighted\n       and sent to the test application.\n\n       The name \"className::function\" identifies the method/proc being\n       changed.\n\n       If an args list was specified when the function was defined in the\n       class definition, the args list for the body command must match in\n       meaning.  Variable names can change, but the argument lists must have\n       the same required arguments and the same default values for optional\n       arguments.  The special args argument acts as a wildcard when included\n       in the args list in the class definition; it will match zero or more\n       arguments of any type when the body is redefined.\n\n       If the body string starts with \"@\", it is treated as the symbolic name\n       for a C procedure.  The args list has little meaning for the C\n       procedure, except to document the expected usage.  (The C procedure is\n       not guaranteed to use arguments in this manner.)  If body does not\n       start with \"@\", it is treated as a Tcl command script.  When the\n       function is invoked, command line arguments are matched against the\n       args list, and local variables are created to represent each argument.\n       This is the usual behavior for a Tcl-style proc.\n\n       Symbolic names for C procedures are established by registering\n       procedures via Itcl_RegisterC().  This is usually done in the\n       Tcl_AppInit() procedure, which is automatically called when the\n       interpreter starts up.  In the following example, the procedure\n       My_FooCmd() is registered with the symbolic name \"foo\".\tThis procedure\n       can be referenced in the body command as \"@foo\".\n\t      int\n\t      Tcl_AppInit(interp)\n\t\t  Tcl_Interp *interp;\t  /* Interpreter for application. */\n\t      {\n\t\t  if (Itcl_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {\n\t\t      return TCL_ERROR;\n\t\t  }\n\n\t\t  if (Itcl_RegisterC(interp, \"foo\", My_FooCmd) != TCL_OK) {\n\t\t      return TCL_ERROR;\n\t\t  }\n\t      }"
