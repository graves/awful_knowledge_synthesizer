If the user is not the\n     super-user, passwd first prompts for the current password and will not\n     continue unless the correct password is entered.\n\n     When entering the new password, the characters entered do not echo, in\n     order to avoid the password being seen by a passer-by.  The passwd\n     utility prompts for the new password twice in order to detect typing\n     errors.\n\n     The new password should be at least six characters long and not purely\n     alphabetic.  Its total length should be less than _PASSWORD_LEN\n     (currently 128 characters), although some directory systems allow longer\n     passwords.  Numbers, upper case letters, and meta characters are\n     encouraged.\n\n     Once the password has been verified, passwd communicates the new password\n     to the directory system."
