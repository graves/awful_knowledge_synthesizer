The aspect ratio is specified as\n       100*width/height.  100 means the text should be as wide as it is tall,\n       200 means the text should be twice as wide as it is tall, 50 means the\n       text should be twice as tall as it is wide, and so on.  Used to choose\n       line length for text if width option is not specified.  Defaults to\n       150.  [-justify justify] Specifies how to justify lines of text.  Must\n       be one of left, center, or right.  Defaults to left.  This option works\n       together with the anchor, aspect, padX, padY, and width options to\n       provide a variety of arrangements of the text within the window.  The\n       aspect and width options determine the amount of screen space needed to\n       display the text.  The anchor, padX, and padY options determine where\n       this rectangular area is displayed within the widget's window, and the\n       justify option determines how each line is displayed within that\n       rectangular region.  For example, suppose anchor is e and justify is\n       left, and that the message window is much larger than needed for the\n       text.  The text will be displayed so that the left edges of all the\n       lines line up and the right edge of the longest line is padX from the\n       right side of the window;  the entire text block will be centered in\n       the vertical span of the window.  [-width width] Specifies the length\n       of lines in the window.\tThe value may have any of the forms acceptable\n       to Tk_GetPixels.  If this option has a value greater than zero then the\n       aspect option is ignored and the width option determines the line\n       length.\tIf this option has a value less than or equal to zero, then\n       the aspect option determines the line length.\n______________________________________________________________________________"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `message`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The message command creates a new window (given by the pathName\n       argument) and makes it into a message widget.  Additional options,\n       described above, may be specified on the command line or in the option\n       database to configure aspects of the message such as its colors, font,\n       text, and initial relief.  The message command returns its pathName\n       argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a\n       window named pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.\n\n       A message is a widget that displays a textual string.  A message widget\n       has three special features.  First, it breaks up its string into lines\n       in order to produce a given aspect ratio for the window.  The line\n       breaks are chosen at word boundaries wherever possible (if not even a\n       single word would fit on a line, then the word will be split across\n       lines).\tNewline characters in the string will force line breaks;  they\n       can be used, for example, to leave blank lines in the display."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `message`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nThe second feature of a message widget is justification.  The text may\n       be displayed left-justified (each line starts at the left side of the\n       window), centered on a line-by-line basis, or right-justified (each\n       line ends at the right side of the window).\n\n       The third feature of a message widget is that it handles control\n       characters and non-printing characters specially.  Tab characters are\n       replaced with enough blank space to line up on the next 8-character\n       boundary.  Newlines cause line breaks.  Other control characters (ASCII\n       code less than 0x20) and characters not defined in the font are\n       displayed as a four-character sequence \\xhh where hh is the two-digit\n       hexadecimal number corresponding to the character.  In the unusual case\n       where the font does not contain all of the characters in\n       “0123456789abcdef\\x” then control characters and undefined characters\n       are not displayed at all.\n\nWIDGET COMMAND\n       The message command creates a new Tcl command whose name is pathName.\n       This command may be used to invoke various operations on the widget.\n       It has the following general form:\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The\n       following commands are possible for message widgets:"
