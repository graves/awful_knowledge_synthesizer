The\n       only requirement is that the other shell (identified by its path), is\n       actually executable on the current machine.\n\n       While for most platform this means that the architecture of the\n       interrogated shell is identical to the architecture of the running\n       shell this is not generally true. A counter example are all platforms\n       which have 32 and 64 bit variants and where a 64bit system is able to\n       run 32bit code. For these running and interrogated shell may have\n       different 32/64 bit settings and thus different identifiers."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the platform::shell package?
  manpageQuestion2: How would you use the platform::shell package to identify the architecture of a different Tcl shell?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of using the platform::shell::platform command to determine the architecture of the current Tcl shell?
