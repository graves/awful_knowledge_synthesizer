The values are expected to\n\t      be already bee-encoded, but the keys must not be. Their encoding\n\t      will be done by the command itself.\n\n       ::bee::encodeDict dict\n\t      Takes a dictionary list of string keys and bee-encoded values\n\t      and returns the bee-encoding of the list. Note that the keys in\n\t      the input must not be bee-encoded already. This will be done by\n\t      the command itself.\n\n   DECODER\n       The package provides two main decoder commands, one for decoding a\n       string expected to contain a complete data structure, the other for the\n       incremental decoding of bee-values arriving on a channel. The latter\n       command is asynchronous and provides the completed decoded values to\n       the user through a command callback.\n\n       ::bee::decode string ?endvar? ?start?\n\t      Takes the bee-encoding in the string and returns one decoded\n\t      value. In the case of this being a container all contained\n\t      values are decoded recursively as well and the result is a\n\t      properly nested tcl list and/or dictionary.\n\n\t      If the optional endvar is set then it is the name of a variable\n\t      to store the index of the first character after the decoded\n\t      value into. In other words, if the string contains more than one\n\t      value then endvar can be used to obtain the position of the bee-\n\t      value after the bee-value currently decoded. together with\n\t      start, see below, it is possible to iterate over the string to\n\t      extract all contained values.\n\n\t      The optional start index defaults to 0, i.e. the beginning of\n\t      the string. It is the index of the first character of the bee-\n\t      encoded value to extract.\n\n       ::bee::decodeIndices string ?endvar? ?start?\n\t      Takes the same arguments as ::bee::decode and returns the same\n\t      information in endvar. The result however is different. Instead\n\t      of the tcl value contained in the string it returns a list\n\t      describing the value with respect to type and location (indices\n\t      for the first and last character of the bee-value). In case of a\n\t      container the structure also contains the same information for\n\t      all the embedded values.\n\n\t      Formally the results for the various types of bee-values are:\n\n\t      string A list containing three elements:\n\n\t\t     •\t    The constant string string, denoting the type of\n\t\t\t    the value.\n\n\t\t     •\t    An integer number greater than or equal to zero.\n\t\t\t    This is the index of the first character of the\n\t\t\t    bee-value in the input string.\n\n\t\t     •\t    An integer number greater than or equal to zero.\n\t\t\t    This is the index of the last character of the\n\t\t\t    bee-value in the input string.\n\n\t      Note that this information is present in the results for all\n\t      four types of bee-values, with only the first element changing\n\t      according to the type of the value.\n\n\t      integer\n\t\t     The result is like for strings, except that the type\n\t\t     element contains the constant string integer.\n\n\t      list   The result is like before, with two exceptions: One, the\n\t\t     type element contains the constant string list. And two,\n\t\t     the result actually contains four elements. The last\n\t\t     element is new, and contains the index data as described\n\t\t     here for all elements of the bee-list.\n\n\t      dictionary\n\t\t     The result is like for strings, except that the type\n\t\t     element contains the constant string dict. A fourth\n\t\t     element is present as well, with a slightly different\n\t\t     structure than for lists. The element is a dictionary\n\t\t     mapping from the strings keys of the bee-dictionary to a\n\t\t     list containing two elements. The first of them is the\n\t\t     index information for the key, and the second element is\n\t\t     the index information for the value the key maps to. This\n\t\t     structure is the only which contains not only index data,\n\t\t     but actual values from the bee-string. While the index\n\t\t     information of the keys is unique enough, i.e.\n\t\t     serviceable as keys, they are not easy to navigate when\n\t\t     trying to find particular element. Using the actual keys\n\t\t     makes this much easier."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `bee`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-exact By default the decoder assumes that the remainder of the\n\t\t     data in the channel consists only of bee-values, and\n\t\t     reads as much as possible per event, without regard for\n\t\t     boundaries between bee-values. This means that if the the\n\t\t     input contains non-bee data after a series of bee-value\n\t\t     the beginning of that data may be lost because it was\n\t\t     already read by the decoder, but not processed.\n\n\t\t     The -exact was made for this situation. When specified\n\t\t     the decoder will take care to not read any characters\n\t\t     behind the currently processed bee-value, so that any\n\t\t     non-bee data is kept in the channel for further\n\t\t     processing after removal of the decoder.\n\n\n\t      -prefix\n\t\t     If this option is specified its value is assumed to be\n\t\t     the beginning of the bee-value and used to initialize the\n\t\t     internal decoder buffer. This feature is required if the\n\t\t     creator of the decoder used data from the channel to\n\t\t     determine if it should create the decoder or not. Without\n\t\t     the option this data would be lost to the decoding."

The basic forms are strings and integer\n       numbers, and the containers are lists and dictionaries.\n\n       String S\n\t      A string S of length L is encoded by the string \"L:S\", where the\n\t      length is written out in textual form.\n\n       Integer N\n\t      An integer number N is encoded by the string \"iNe\".\n\n       List v1 ... vn\n\t      A list of the values v1 to vn is encoded by the string\n\t      \"lBV1...BVne\" where \"BVi\" is the bee-encoding of the value \"vi\".\n\n       Dict k1 -> v1 ...\n\t      A dictionary mapping the string key ki to the value vi, for i in\n\t      1 ... n is encoded by the string \"dBKiBVi...e\" for i in 1 ... n,\n\t      where \"BKi\" is the bee-encoding of the key string \"ki\".  and\n\t      \"BVi\" is the bee-encoding of the value \"vi\".\n\n\t      Note: The bee-encoding does not retain the order of the keys in\n\t      the input, but stores in a sorted order. The sorting is done for\n\t      the \"raw strings\".\n\n       Note that the type of each encoded item can be determined immediately\n       from the first character of its representation:\n\n       i      Integer.\n\n       l      List.\n\n       d      Dictionary.\n\n       [0-9]  String.\n\n       By wrapping an integer number into i...e the format makes sure that\n       they are different from strings, which all begin with a digit.\n\nEXAMPLES\nBUGS, IDEAS, FEEDBACK\n       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain\n       bugs and other problems.
