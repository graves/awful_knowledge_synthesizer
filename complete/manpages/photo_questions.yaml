Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `photo`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       A photo is an image whose pixels can display any color or be\n       transparent.  A photo image is stored internally in full color (32 bits\n       per pixel), and is displayed using dithering if necessary.  Image data\n       for a photo image can be obtained from a file or a string, or it can be\n       supplied from C code through a procedural interface.  At present, only\n       GIF and PPM/PGM formats are supported, but an interface exists to allow\n       additional image file formats to be added easily.  A photo image is\n       transparent in regions where no image data has been supplied or where\n       it has been set transparent by the transparency set subcommand.\n\nCREATING PHOTOS\n       Like all images, photos are created using the image create command.\n       Photos support the following options:\n\n       -data string\n\t      Specifies the contents of the image as a string.\tThe string\n\t      should contain binary data or, for some formats, base64-encoded\n\t      data (this is currently guaranteed to be supported for GIF\n\t      images).\tThe format of the string must be one of those for\n\t      which there is an image file format handler that will accept\n\t      string data.  If both the -data and -file options are specified,\n\t      the -file option takes precedence."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `photo`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\n-format format-name\n\t      Specifies the name of the file format for the data specified\n\t      with the -data or -file option.\n\n       -file name\n\t      name gives the name of a file that is to be read to supply data\n\t      for the photo image.  The file format must be one of those for\n\t      which there is an image file format handler that can read data.\n\n       -gamma value\n\t      Specifies that the colors allocated for displaying this image in\n\t      a window should be corrected for a non-linear display with the\n\t      specified gamma exponent value.  (The intensity produced by most\n\t      CRT displays is a power function of the input value, to a good\n\t      approximation; gamma is the exponent and is typically around 2).\n\t      The value specified must be greater than zero.  The default\n\t      value is one (no correction).  In general, values greater than\n\t      one will make the image lighter, and values less than one will\n\t      make it darker.\n\n       -height number\n\t      Specifies the height of the image, in pixels.  This option is\n\t      useful primarily in situations where the user wishes to build up\n\t      the contents of the image piece by piece.  A value of zero (the\n\t      default) allows the image to expand or shrink vertically to fit\n\t      the data stored in it.\n\n       -palette palette-spec\n\t      Specifies the resolution of the color cube to be allocated for\n\t      displaying this image, and thus the number of colors used from\n\t      the colormaps of the windows where it is displayed.  The\n\t      palette-spec string may be either a single decimal number,\n\t      specifying the number of shades of gray to use, or three decimal\n\t      numbers separated by slashes (/), specifying the number of\n\t      shades of red, green and blue to use, respectively.  If the\n\t      first form (a single number) is used, the image will be\n\t      displayed in monochrome (i.e., grayscale).\n\n       -width number\n\t      Specifies the width of the image, in pixels.    This option is\n\t      useful primarily in situations where the user wishes to build up\n\t      the contents of the image piece by piece.  A value of zero (the\n\t      default) allows the image to expand or shrink horizontally to\n\t      fit the data stored in it.\n\nIMAGE COMMAND\n       When a photo image is created, Tk also creates a new command whose name\n       is the same as the image.  This command may be used to invoke various\n       operations on the image.  It has the following general form:\n\t      imageName option ?arg arg ...?\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.\n\n       Those options that write data to the image generally expand the size of\n       the image, if necessary, to accommodate the data written to the image,\n       unless the user has specified non-zero values for the -width and/or\n       -height configuration options, in which case the width and/or height,\n       respectively, of the image will not be changed.\n\n       The following commands are possible for photo images:\n\n       imageName blank\n\t      Blank the image; that is, set the entire image to have no data,\n\t      so it will be displayed as transparent, and the background of\n\t      whatever window it is displayed in will show through.\n\n       imageName cget option\n\t      Returns the current value of the configuration option given by\n\t      option.  Option may have any of the values accepted by the image\n\t      create photo command.\n\n       imageName configure ?option? ?value option value ...?\n\t      Query or modify the configuration options for the image.\tIf no\n\t      option is specified, returns a list describing all of the\n\t      available options for imageName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for\n\t      information on the format of this list).\tIf option is specified\n\t      with no value, then the command returns a list describing the\n\t      one named option (this list will be identical to the\n\t      corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option is\n\t      specified).  If one or more option-value pairs are specified,\n\t      then the command modifies the given option(s) to have the given\n\t      value(s);  in this case the command returns an empty string.\n\t      Option may have any of the values accepted by the image create\n\t      photo command.\n\n       imageName copy sourceImage ?option value(s) ...?\n\t      Copies a region from the image called sourceImage (which must be\n\t      a photo image) to the image called imageName, possibly with\n\t      pixel zooming and/or subsampling.  If no options are specified,\n\t      this command copies the whole of sourceImage into imageName,\n\t      starting at coordinates (0,0) in imageName.  The following\n\t      options may be specified:\n\n\t      -from x1 y1 x2 y2\n\t\t     Specifies a rectangular sub-region of the source image to\n\t\t     be copied.  (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) specify diagonally\n\t\t     opposite corners of the rectangle.  If x2 and y2 are not\n\t\t     specified, the default value is the bottom-right corner\n\t\t     of the source image.  The pixels copied will include the\n\t\t     left and top edges of the specified rectangle but not the\n\t\t     bottom or right edges.  If the -from option is not given,\n\t\t     the default is the whole source image.\n\n\t      -to x1 y1 x2 y2\n\t\t     Specifies a rectangular sub-region of the destination\n\t\t     image to be affected.  (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) specify\n\t\t     diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle.  If x2 and\n\t\t     y2 are not specified, the default value is (x1,y1) plus\n\t\t     the size of the source region (after subsampling and\n\t\t     zooming, if specified).  If x2 and y2 are specified, the\n\t\t     source region will be replicated if necessary to fill the\n\t\t     destination region in a tiled fashion.\n\n\t      -shrink\n\t\t     Specifies that the size of the destination image should\n\t\t     be reduced, if necessary, so that the region being copied\n\t\t     into is at the bottom-right corner of the image.  This\n\t\t     option will not affect the width or height of the image\n\t\t     if the user has specified a non-zero value for the -width\n\t\t     or -height configuration option, respectively.\n\n\t      -zoom x y\n\t\t     Specifies that the source region should be magnified by a\n\t\t     factor of x in the X direction and y in the Y direction.\n\t\t     If y is not given, the default value is the same as x.\n\t\t     With this option, each pixel in the source image will be\n\t\t     expanded into a block of x x y pixels in the destination\n\t\t     image, all the same color.  x and y must be greater than\n\t\t     0.\n\n\t      -subsample x y\n\t\t     Specifies that the source image should be reduced in size\n\t\t     by using only every xth pixel in the X direction and yth\n\t\t     pixel in the Y direction.\tNegative values will cause the\n\t\t     image to be flipped about the Y or X axes, respectively.\n\t\t     If y is not given, the default value is the same as x.\n\n\t      -compositingrule rule\n\t\t     Specifies how transparent pixels in the source image are\n\t\t     combined with the destination image.  When a compositing\n\t\t     rule of overlay is set, the old contents of the\n\t\t     destination image are visible, as if the source image\n\t\t     were printed on a piece of transparent film and placed\n\t\t     over the top of the destination.  When a compositing rule\n\t\t     of set is set, the old contents of the destination image\n\t\t     are discarded and the source image is used as-is.\tThe\n\t\t     default compositing rule is overlay.\n\n       imageName data ?option value(s) ...?\n\t      Returns image data in the form of a string. The following\n\t      options may be specified:\n\n\t      -background color\n\t\t     If the color is specified, the data will not contain any\n\t\t     transparency information. In all transparent pixels the\n\t\t     color will be replaced by the specified color.\n\n\t      -format format-name\n\t\t     Specifies the name of the image file format handler to be\n\t\t     used.  Specifically, this subcommand searches for the\n\t\t     first handler whose name matches an initial substring of\n\t\t     format-name and which has the capability to read this\n\t\t     image data.  If this option is not given, this subcommand\n\t\t     uses the first handler that has the capability to read\n\t\t     the image data.\n\n\t      -from x1 y1 x2 y2\n\t\t     Specifies a rectangular region of imageName to be\n\t\t     returned.\tIf only x1 and y1 are specified, the region\n\t\t     extends from (x1,y1) to the bottom-right corner of\n\t\t     imageName.  If all four coordinates are given, they\n\t\t     specify diagonally opposite corners of the rectangular\n\t\t     region, including x1,y1 and excluding x2,y2.  The\n\t\t     default, if this option is not given, is the whole image.\n\n\t      -grayscale\n\t\t     If this options is specified, the data will not contain\n\t\t     color information. All pixel data will be transformed\n\t\t     into grayscale.\n\n       imageName get x y\n\t      Returns the color of the pixel at coordinates (x,y) in the image\n\t      as a list of three integers between 0 and 255, representing the\n\t      red, green and blue components respectively.\n\n       imageName put data ?option value(s) ...?\n\t      Sets pixels in  imageName to the data specified in data.\tThis\n\t      command first searches the list of image file format handlers\n\t      for a handler that can interpret the data in data, and then\n\t      reads the image encoded within into imageName (the destination\n\t      image).  If data does not match any known format, an attempt to\n\t      interpret it as a (top-to-bottom) list of scan-lines is made,\n\t      with each scan-line being a (left-to-right) list of pixel colors\n\t      (see Tk_GetColor for a description of valid colors.)  Every\n\t      scan-line must be of the same length.  Note that when data is a\n\t      single color name, you are instructing Tk to fill a rectangular\n\t      region with that color.  The following options may be specified:\n\n\t      -format format-name\n\t\t     Specifies the format of the image data in data.\n\t\t     Specifically, only image file format handlers whose names\n\t\t     begin with format-name will be used while searching for\n\t\t     an image data format handler to read the data.\n\n\t      -to x1 y1 ?x2 y2?\n\t\t     Specifies the coordinates of the top-left corner (x1,y1)\n\t\t     of the region of imageName into which the image data will\n\t\t     be copied.  The default position is (0,0).  If x2,y2 is\n\t\t     given and data is not large enough to cover the rectangle\n\t\t     specified by this option, the image data extracted will\n\t\t     be tiled so it covers the entire destination rectangle.\n\t\t     Note that if data specifies a single color value, then a\n\t\t     region extending to the bottom-right corner represented\n\t\t     by (x2,y2) will be filled with that color.\n\n       imageName read filename ?option value(s) ...?\n\t      Reads image data from the file named filename into the image.\n\t      This command first searches the list of image file format\n\t      handlers for a handler that can interpret the data in filename,\n\t      and then reads the image in filename into imageName (the\n\t      destination image).  The following options may be specified:\n\n\t      -format format-name\n\t\t     Specifies the format of the image data in filename.\n\t\t     Specifically, only image file format handlers whose names\n\t\t     begin with format-name will be used while searching for\n\t\t     an image data format handler to read the data.\n\n\t      -from x1 y1 x2 y2\n\t\t     Specifies a rectangular sub-region of the image file data\n\t\t     to be copied to the destination image.  If only x1 and y1\n\t\t     are specified, the region extends from (x1,y1) to the\n\t\t     bottom-right corner of the image in the image file.  If\n\t\t     all four coordinates are specified, they specify\n\t\t     diagonally opposite corners or the region.  The default,\n\t\t     if this option is not specified, is the whole of the\n\t\t     image in the image file.\n\n\t      -shrink\n\t\t     If this option, the size of imageName will be reduced, if\n\t\t     necessary, so that the region into which the image file\n\t\t     data are read is at the bottom-right corner of the\n\t\t     imageName.  This option will not affect the width or\n\t\t     height of the image if the user has specified a non-zero\n\t\t     value for the -width or -height configuration option,\n\t\t     respectively.\n\n\t      -to x y\n\t\t     Specifies the coordinates of the top-left corner of the\n\t\t     region of imageName into which data from filename are to\n\t\t     be read.  The default is (0,0).\n\n       imageName redither\n\t      The dithering algorithm used in displaying photo images\n\t      propagates quantization errors from one pixel to its neighbors.\n\t      If the image data for imageName is supplied in pieces, the\n\t      dithered image may not be exactly correct.  Normally the\n\t      difference is not noticeable, but if it is a problem, this\n\t      command can be used to recalculate the dithered image in each\n\t      window where the image is displayed.\n\n       imageName transparency subcommand ?arg arg ...?\n\t      Allows examination and manipulation of the transparency\n\t      information in the photo image.  Several subcommands are\n\t      available:\n\n\t      imageName transparency get x y\n\t\t     Returns a boolean indicating if the pixel at (x,y) is\n\t\t     transparent.\n\n\t      imageName transparency set x y boolean\n\t\t     Makes the pixel at (x,y) transparent if boolean is true,\n\t\t     and makes that pixel opaque otherwise.\n\n       imageName write filename ?option value(s) ...?\n\t      Writes image data from imageName to a file named filename.  The\n\t      following options may be specified:\n\n\t      -background color\n\t\t     If the color is specified, the data will not contain any\n\t\t     transparency information. In all transparent pixels the\n\t\t     color will be replaced by the specified color.\n\n\t      -format format-name\n\t\t     Specifies the name of the image file format handler to be\n\t\t     used to write the data to the file.  Specifically, this\n\t\t     subcommand searches for the first handler whose name\n\t\t     matches an initial substring of format-name and which has\n\t\t     the capability to write an image file.  If this option is\n\t\t     not given, this subcommand uses the first handler that\n\t\t     has the capability to write an image file.\n\n\t      -from x1 y1 x2 y2\n\t\t     Specifies a rectangular region of imageName to be written\n\t\t     to the image file.  If only x1 and y1 are specified, the\n\t\t     region extends from (x1,y1) to the bottom-right corner of\n\t\t     imageName.  If all four coordinates are given, they\n\t\t     specify diagonally opposite corners of the rectangular\n\t\t     region.  The default, if this option is not given, is the\n\t\t     whole image.\n\n\t      -grayscale\n\t\t     If this options is specified, the data will not contain\n\t\t     color information. All pixel data will be transformed\n\t\t     into grayscale.\n\nIMAGE FORMATS\n       The photo image code is structured to allow handlers for additional\n       image file formats to be added easily.  The photo image code maintains\n       a list of these handlers.  Handlers are added to the list by\n       registering them with a call to Tk_CreatePhotoImageFormat.  The\n       standard Tk distribution comes with handlers for PPM/PGM and GIF\n       formats, which are automatically registered on initialization.\n\n       When reading an image file or processing string data specified with the\n       -data configuration option, the photo image code invokes each handler\n       in turn until one is found that claims to be able to read the data in\n       the file or string.  Usually this will find the correct handler, but if\n       it does not, the user may give a format name with the -format option to\n       specify which handler to use.  In fact the photo image code will try\n       those handlers whose names begin with the string specified for the\n       -format option (the comparison is case-insensitive).  For example, if\n       the user specifies -format gif, then a handler named GIF87 or GIF89 may\n       be invoked, but a handler named JPEG may not (assuming that such\n       handlers had been registered).\n\n       When writing image data to a file, the processing of the -format option\n       is slightly different: the string value given for the -format option\n       must begin with the complete name of the requested handler, and may\n       contain additional information following that, which the handler can\n       use, for example, to specify which variant to use of the formats\n       supported by the handler.  Note that not all image handlers may support\n       writing transparency data to a file, even where the target image format\n       does.\n\nCOLOR ALLOCATION\n       When a photo image is displayed in a window, the photo image code\n       allocates colors to use to display the image and dithers the image, if\n       necessary, to display a reasonable approximation to the image using the\n       colors that are available.  The colors are allocated as a color cube,\n       that is, the number of colors allocated is the product of the number of\n       shades of red, green and blue.\n\n       Normally, the number of colors allocated is chosen based on the depth\n       of the window.  For example, in an 8-bit PseudoColor window, the photo\n       image code will attempt to allocate seven shades of red, seven shades\n       of green and four shades of blue, for a total of 198 colors.  In a\n       1-bit StaticGray (monochrome) window, it will allocate two colors,\n       black and white.  In a 24-bit DirectColor or TrueColor window, it will\n       allocate 256 shades each of red, green and blue.  Fortunately, because\n       of the way that pixel values can be combined in DirectColor and\n       TrueColor windows, this only requires 256 colors to be allocated.  If\n       not all of the colors can be allocated, the photo image code reduces\n       the number of shades of each primary color and tries again.\n\n       The user can exercise some control over the number of colors that a\n       photo image uses with the -palette configuration option.  If this\n       option is used, it specifies the maximum number of shades of each\n       primary color to try to allocate.  It can also be used to force the\n       image to be displayed in shades of gray, even on a color display, by\n       giving a single number rather than three numbers separated by slashes.\n\nCREDITS\n       The photo image type was designed and implemented by Paul Mackerras,\n       based on his earlier photo widget and some suggestions from John\n       Ousterhout.\n\nEXAMPLE\n       Load an image from a file and tile it to the size of a window, which is\n       useful for producing a tiled background:\n\t      # These lines should be called once\n\t      image create photo untiled -file \"theFile.ppm\"\n\t      image create photo tiled\n\n\t      # These lines should be called whenever .someWidget changes\n\t      # size; a <Configure> binding is useful here\n\t      set width  [winfo width .someWidget]\n\t      set height [winfo height .someWidget]\n\t      tiled copy untiled -to 0 0 $width $height -shrink"
