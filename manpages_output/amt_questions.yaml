    Manpage text:

    The options are as follows:

         -m      Skip the memory test.

         -p      Skip the privileged instructions test.

         -q      Suppress the screen output.

         -s      Skip the memory separation and protection test.

    EXIT CODES
         <0      An error occured in executing the tests.

         =0      All the tests passed.

         >0      The number of tests that failed or were skipped.

    NOTES
         The overall result (pass or fail) is logged in the audit trail and system
         log.  The auditd(8) daemon must already be running for the results to be
         stored in the audit trail file.

         One of the above test may be skipped without getting a negative result.
         A test is skipped either with one of the above command-line options or
         automatically if there is not a test compatiable with the Target Of
         Evaluation (TOE). The audit administrator may want to perform the memory
         test only on startup since it can have large negative impact on the
         system performance.
