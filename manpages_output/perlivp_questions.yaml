Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `perlivp`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nPERLIVP(1)\t       Perl Programmers Reference Guide \t    PERLIVP(1)\n\n\nNAME\n       perlivp - Perl Installation Verification Procedure\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       perlivp [-p] [-v] [-h]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The perlivp program is set up at Perl source code build time to test\n       the Perl version it was built under.  It can be used after running:\n\n\t   make install\n\n       (or your platform's equivalent procedure) to verify that perl and its\n       libraries have been installed correctly.  A correct installation is\n       verified by output that looks like:\n\n\t   ok 1\n\t   ok 2\n\n       etc.\n\nOPTIONS\n       -h help\n\t    Prints out a brief help message.\n\n       -p print preface\n\t    Gives a description of each test prior to performing it.\n\n       -v verbose\n\t    Gives more detailed information about each test, after it has been\n\t    performed.\tNote that any failed tests ought to print out some\n\t    extra information whether or not -v is thrown.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n       •   print \"# Perl binary '$perlpath' does not appear executable.\\n\";\n\n\t   Likely to occur for a perl binary that was not properly installed.\n\t   Correct by conducting a proper installation.\n\n       •   print \"# Perl version '$]' installed, expected $ivp_VERSION.\\n\";\n\n\t   Likely to occur for a perl that was not properly installed.\n\t   Correct by conducting a proper installation.\n\n       •   print \"# Perl \\@INC directory '$_' does not appear to exist.\\n\";\n\n\t   Likely to occur for a perl library tree that was not properly\n\t   installed.  Correct by conducting a proper installation.\n\n       •   print \"# Needed module '$_' does not appear to be properly\n\t   installed.\\n\";\n\n\t   One of the two modules that is used by perlivp was not present in\n\t   the installation.  This is a serious error since it adversely\n\t   affects perlivp's ability to function.  You may be able to correct\n\t   this by performing a proper perl installation.\n\n       •   print \"# Required module '$_' does not appear to be properly\n\t   installed.\\n\";\n\n\t   An attempt to \"eval \"require $module\"\" failed, even though the list\n\t   of extensions indicated that it should succeed.  Correct by\n\t   conducting a proper installation.\n\n       •   print \"# Unnecessary module 'bLuRfle' appears to be installed.\\n\";\n\n\t   This test not coming out ok could indicate that you have in fact\n\t   installed a bLuRfle.pm module or that the \"eval \" require\n\t   \\\"$module_name.pm\\\"; \"\" test may give misleading results with your\n\t   installation of perl.  If yours is the latter case then please let\n\t   the author know.\n\n       •   print \"# file\",+($#missing == 0) ? '' : 's',\" missing from\n\t   installation:\\n\";\n\n\t   One or more files turned up missing according to a run of\n\t   \"ExtUtils::Installed -> validate()\" over your installation.\n\t   Correct by conducting a proper installation.\n\n       For further information on how to conduct a proper installation consult\n       the INSTALL file that comes with the perl source and the README file\n       for your platform.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Peter Prymmer\n\nperl v5.34.1\t\t\t  2024-12-14\t\t\t    PERLIVP(1)"
