For example,\n     it handles entries generated via the os_log(3) family of facilities.\n\n\t   { process }\n\t\t`--- os_log ---> [ page ]\n\t\t\t\t [ page ]\n\t\t\t\t [ page ]\n\t\t\t\t     `---> { logd }\n\t\t\t\t\t      | `---> [ buffer ]\n\t\t\t\t\t      |\n\t\t\t\t\t      `---> [ data store ]\n\n     All processes that use os_log(3) share pages of memory with logd and\n     append entries to them.  logd reads pages and combines and compresses\n     this data.  Depending on configured policies, it keeps them in a local\n     ring buffer or writes them out to persistent storage.\n\n\t   { logd }\n\t      | `---> [ buffer ] ----.\n\t      | \t\t     ,`---> { log show }\n\t      `---> [ data store ] -'\n\n     The log(1) utility can view these data by requesting logd for access to\n     both the ring buffer and the persistent storage."
