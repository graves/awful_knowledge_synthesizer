PNG\n       provides a patent-free replacement for GIF, and can also replace many\n       common uses of TIFF. Indexed-color, grayscale, and truecolor images are\n       supported, plus an optional alpha channel.  Sample depths range from 1\n       to 16 bits.\n       PNG is designed to work well in online viewing applications, such as\n       the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive\n       display option.\tPNG is robust, providing both full file integrity\n       checking and fast, simple detection of common transmission errors.\n       Also, PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color\n       matching on heterogeneous platforms.\n\n\nSEE ALSO\n       libpng(3), zlib(3), deflate(5), and zlib(5)\n\n       PNG Specification (Third Edition) Candidate Recommendation Draft,\n       January 2025:\n\n\t      https://www.w3.org/TR/2025/CRD-png-3-20250121/\n\n       PNG Specification (Second Edition), November 2003:\n\n\t      https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-PNG-20031110/\n\n       PNG 1.2 Specification, July 1999:\n\n\t      https://png-mng.sourceforge.io/pub/png/spec/1.2/\n\n       PNG 1.0 Specification, October 1996:\n\n\t      RFC 2083\n\t      https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2083.txt\n\n\t      or W3C Recommendation\n\t      https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-png-961001"
