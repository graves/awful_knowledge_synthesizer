It can\n     query the plug-in database and make limited interventions for debugging\n     and development.\n\n     A list of flags and their descriptions:\n\n     -A, --all-versions\n\t      Matches find all versions of a given plug-in known to the\n\t      system. By default, only the latest (highest) version is\n\t      returned.\n\n     -a       Explicitly adds plugins at the file location(s) given, even if\n\t      they are not normally eligible for automatic discovery. Note\n\t      that database clean-ups may eventually remove them in that case.\n\n     -e election\n\t      Perform a matching operation (see -m) and apply the given user\n\t      election setting to all matching plug-ins. Elections can be\n\t      \"use\", \"ignore\", and \"default\". Elections are applied to all\n\t      plug-ins with given identifier."

Only plug-ins that match all\n     given criteria are eligible. Criteria are expressed as \"key\" (must be\n     present) or \"key=value\" (key must be present and have the given value).\n     The -i and -p arguments are shorthands for the conventional identifier\n     and protocol matching keys."

- prompt: "You are playing the role of a college professor. Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `pluginkit`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nAll matching plug-ins are reduced according to the -A and -D options\n     given. With -D, all eligible plug-ins are returned. With -A, the last-\n     registered (by timestamp) instance of each version is returned. By\n     default, only the last instance of the highest version is returned. Note\n     that this reduction is applied after matching.\n\nEXPLICIT CHANGES\n     The -a and -r options make changes to the system's plug-in registry. The\n     registry is designed to operate automatically, and will update on its own\n     as applications are installed, removed, and discovered. The options\n     available through pluginkit are intended only for limited manipulation\n     during plug-in development and for certain maintenance tasks. They cannot\n     make permanent alterations of the automatic registry state.\n\nSEE ALSO\n     launchd(8), pkd(8)\n\nHISTORY\n     The pluginkit command first appeared in OS X 10.9.\n\nDarwin\t\t\t       January 22, 2014 \t\t\tDarwin"
