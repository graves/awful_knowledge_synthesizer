If a packet header is to be\n       logged, the entire header is logged (including any IP options - TCP/UDP\n       options are not included when it calculates header size) or not at all.\n       The packet contents is also logged after the header.\n\n       Prepending every packet header logged is a structure containing\n       information relevant to the packet following and why it was logged.\n       The structure's format is as follows:\n\n       struct ipl_ci   {\n\t       u_long  sec;\t /* time when the packet was logged */\n\t       u_long  usec;\n\t       u_long  plen;\t /* length of packet data logged */\n\t       u_short hlen;\t /* length of headers logged */\n\t       u_short rule;\t /* rule number (for log ...) or 0 if result = log */\n\t       u_long  flags:24; /* XXX FIXME do we care about the extra bytes? */\n       #if (defined(OpenBSD) && (OpenBSD <= 1991011) && (OpenBSD >= 199606))\n\t       u_long  filler:8; /* XXX FIXME do we care? */\n\t       u_char  ifname[IFNAMSIZ];\n       #else\n\t       u_long  unit:8;\n\t       u_char  ifname[4];\n       #endif\n       };"

Should the packet contents finish on a non-32bit\n       boundary, then the last few bytes are not logged to ensure the log entry\n       is aligned to a 32bit boundary.\n\n       ipl is a read-only (sequential) character pseudo-device.\n\n       The ioctls which are loaded with this device can be found under ipf(4).\n       The only ioctl which is used for logging and doesn't affect the filter is:\n\n\t       ioctl(fd, SIOCIPFFB, int *)\n\n       This ioctl flushes the log buffer and returns the number of bytes\n       flushed.\n\n       There is currently no support for non-blocking IO with this device,\n       meaning all read operations should be considered blocking in nature (if\n       there is no data to read, it will sleep until some is made available)."
