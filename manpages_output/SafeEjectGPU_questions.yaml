This involves interacting with apps to migrate\n     off of ejecting eGPU(s), and triggering the eject itself.\tThis tool can\n     also be used to view what GPUs are attached to the system, their eject\n     status, and what apps hold references to each.\n\n     A list of commands and their descriptions - note that commands affecting\n     state are capitalized, and that multiple (including repeated) commands\n     can occupy the same command line:\n\n     gpus\t\tLists attributes of GPUs currently attached to system\n\t\t\t(gpuid, vendor/model, flags)\n\n     gpuid <gpuid>\tSpecifies which GPU(s) subsequent commands apply to.\n\t\t\tThe default (0x0000) means all eGPUs.  See output of\n\t\t\tgpus command for valid <gpuid> values (of the form\n\t\t\t0x7005) to use.\n\n     gpuids <gpuid1>,...\n\t\t\tComma seperated list of GPU(s) for the app to select\n\t\t\tfrom. See output of gpus command for valid <gpuid>\n\t\t\tvalues (of the form 0x7005) to use.\n\n     apps\t\tLists apps holding references to specified GPU - and\n\t\t\tapp attributes/properties like PID, RPID, USER,\n\t\t\tPROCESS, APIS (Metal, GL/CL, GVA), BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER,\n\t\t\tPATH, GPUEjectPolicy and GPUSelectionPolicy where\n\t\t\tspecified.\n\n     status\t\tShows eject state of specified eGPU(s) (Present,\n\t\t\tInitiated, Finalized).\n\n     Eject\t\tPerforms the full Eject sequence ( Initiate + Relaunch\n\t\t\t+ Finalize ) of specified GPU(s).\n\n     Initiate\t\tInitiates eject of specified eGPU(s).  These eGPUs are\n\t\t\ttemporarily hidden from API instantiations.\n\n     Relaunch\t\tInteracts with apps that hold references to specified\n\t\t\teGPU(s) - to facilitate migration to remaining GPUs.\n\n     Finalize\t\tFinalizes eject of specified eGPU(s) - must be\n\t\t\tphysically unplugged before they can be used again.\n\n     Cancel\t\tCancels initiated eject of specified GPU(s) - instead\n\t\t\tof Finalized.\n\n     RelaunchPID <PID>\tApply relaunch stimulus to one particular PID - for\n\t\t\tapp relaunch stimulus testing.\n\n     RelaunchPIDOnGPU <PID>\n\t\t\tApply relaunch stimulus to one particular PID with set\n\t\t\tof limited GPUs to select from, use gpuids to limit\n\t\t\tthe GPUs seen by an app.\n\n     LaunchOnGPU <path>\n\t\t\tLaunch application from given bundle path with set of\n\t\t\tlimited GPUs, use gpuids to limit the GPUs seen by an\n\t\t\tapp. If the instance of an app is already running,\n\t\t\tthis command has no effect.\n\nEXAMPLES\n     $ SafeEjectGPU gpus\n     List eGPUs.
