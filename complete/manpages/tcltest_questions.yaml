    DESCRIPTION
           The tcltest package provides several utility commands useful in the
           construction of test suites for code instrumented to be run by
           evaluation of Tcl commands.  Notably the built-in commands of the Tcl
           library itself are tested by a test suite using the tcltest package.
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the tcltest package?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the tcltest::loadFile command to load a test script named 'tests.tcl' into the current namespace?
  manpageQuestion3: What is the function of the tcltest::outputFile command, and how would you set it to write test output to a file named 'test_output.txt'?

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `tcltest`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nAll the commands provided by the tcltest package are defined in and\n       exported from the ::tcltest namespace, as indicated in the SYNOPSIS\n       above.  In the following sections, all commands will be described by\n       their simple names, in the interest of brevity.\n\n       The central command of tcltest is test that defines and runs a test.\n       Testing with test involves evaluation of a Tcl script and comparing the\n       result to an expected result, as configured and controlled by a number\n       of options.  Several other commands provided by tcltest govern the\n       configuration of test and the collection of many test commands into\n       test suites.\n\n       See CREATING TEST SUITES WITH TCLTEST below for an extended example of\n       how to use the commands of tcltest to produce test suites for your Tcl-\n       enabled code.\n\nCOMMANDS\n       test name description ?option value ...?\n\t      Defines and possibly runs a test with the name name and\n\t      description description.\tThe name and description of a test are\n\t      used in messages reported by test during the test, as configured\n\t      by the options of tcltest.  The remaining option value arguments\n\t      to test define the test, including the scripts to run, the\n\t      conditions under which to run them, the expected result, and the\n\t      means by which the expected and actual results should be\n\t      compared.  See TESTS below for a complete description of the\n\t      valid options and how they define a test.  The test command\n\t      returns an empty string."
  manpageQuestion1: What is the primary purpose of the tcltest package?
  manpageQuestion2: How can you use the test command in tcltest to define and run a test that evaluates a Tcl script and compares its output to an expected result?
  manpageQuestion3: Can you provide an example of configuring the test command in tcltest to run a script, compare its output with an expected value, and handle any unexpected results?

It is the same as “test name description\n\t      -constraints constraints -body body -result result”.  All other\n\t      options to test take their default values.  When constraints is\n\t      omitted, this form of test can be distinguished from the first\n\t      because all options begin with “-”.\n\n       loadTestedCommands\n\t      Evaluates in the caller's context the script specified by\n\t      configure -load or configure -loadfile.  Returns the result of\n\t      that script evaluation, including any error raised by the\n\t      script.  Use this command and the related configuration options\n\t      to provide the commands to be tested to the interpreter running\n\t      the test suite.\n\n       makeFile contents name ?directory?\n\t      Creates a file named name relative to directory directory and\n\t      write contents to that file using the encoding encoding system.\n\t      If contents does not end with a newline, a newline will be\n\t      appended so that the file named name does end with a newline.\n\t      Because the system encoding is used, this command is only\n\t      suitable for making text files.  The file will be removed by the\n\t      next evaluation of cleanupTests, unless it is removed by\n\t      removeFile first.  The default value of directory is the\n\t      directory configure -tmpdir.  Returns the full path of the file\n\t      created.\tUse this command to create any text file required by a\n\t      test with contents as needed."

Related tests should share a major number.  As a test suite\n       evolves, it is best to have the same test name continue to correspond\n       to the same test, so that it remains meaningful to say things like\n       “Test foo-1.3 passed in all releases up to 3.4, but began failing in\n       release 3.5.”"

Note that the expression form of\n\t      -constraints may interfere with the operation of configure\n\t      -constraints and configure -limitconstraints, and is not\n\t      recommended.  Appropriate constraints should be added to any\n\t      tests that should not always be run.

    TEST CONSTRAINTS
           Constraints are used to determine whether or not a test should be
           skipped.  Each constraint has a name, which may be any string, and a
           boolean value.  Each test has a -constraints value which is a list of
           constraint names.  There are two modes of constraint control.  Most
           frequently, the default mode is used, indicated by a setting of
           configure -limitconstraints to false.  The test will run only if all
           constraints in the list are true-valued.  Thus, the -constraints option
           of test is a convenient, symbolic way to define any conditions required
           for the test to be possible or meaningful.  For example, a test with
           -constraints unix will only be run if the constraint unix is true,
           which indicates the test suite is being run on a Unix platform.

           Each test should include whatever -constraints are required to
           constrain it to run only where appropriate.  Several constraints are
           pre-defined in the tcltest package, listed below.  The registration of
           user-defined constraints is performed by the testConstraint command.
           User-defined constraints may appear within a test file, or within the
           script specified by the configure -load or configure -loadfile options.

    After evaluating all selected test files, a summary of the results is

           tests evaluated, broken down into those skipped, those passed, and
           those failed.  The summary also notes the number of files evaluated,
           and the names of any files with failing tests or errors.  A list of the
           constraints that caused tests to be skipped, and the number of tests
           skipped for each is also printed.  Also, messages are printed if it
           appears that evaluation of a test file has caused any temporary files
           to be left behind in configure -tmpdir.

           Having completed and summarized all selected test files, runAllTests

One script is used to control the entire suite.  The basic\n       function of this script is to call runAllTests after doing any\n       necessary setup.

The\n       first issue relates to the stack level in which test scripts are\n       executed.  Tests nested within other tests may be executed at the same\n       stack level as the outermost test.  For example, in the following code:\n\n\t      test level-1.1 {level 1} {\n\t\t  -body {\n\t\t      test level-2.1 {level 2} {\n\t\t      }\n\t\t  }\n\t      }\n\n       any script executed in level-2.1 may be executed at the same stack\n       level as the script defined for level-1.1.\n\n       In addition, while two tests have been run, results will only be\n       reported by cleanupTests for tests at the same level as test level-1.1.\n       However, test results for all tests run prior to level-1.1 will be\n       available when test level-2.1 runs.  What this means is that if you try\n       to access the test results for test level-2.1, it will may say that “m”\n       tests have run, “n” tests have been skipped, “o” tests have passed and\n       “p” tests have failed, where “m”, “n”, “o”, and “p” refer to tests that\n       were run at the same test level as test level-1.1."
