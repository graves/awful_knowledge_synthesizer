Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `bundle-exec`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nIt also modifies Rubygems:\n\n       •   disallow loading additional gems not in the bundle\n\n       •   modify the gem method to be a no-op if a gem matching the\n\t   requirements is in the bundle, and to raise a Gem::LoadError if\n\t   it´s not\n\n       •   Define Gem.refresh to be a no-op, since the source index is always\n\t   frozen when using bundler, and to prevent gems from the system\n\t   leaking into the environment\n\n       •   Override Gem.bin_path to use the gems in the bundle, making system\n\t   executables work\n\n       •   Add all gems in the bundle into Gem.loaded_specs\n\n\n\n\n       Finally, bundle exec also implicitly modifies Gemfile.lock if the\n       lockfile and the Gemfile do not match. Bundler needs the Gemfile to\n       determine things such as a gem´s groups, autorequire, and platforms,\n       etc., and that information isn´t stored in the lockfile. The Gemfile\n       and lockfile must be synced in order to bundle exec successfully, so\n       bundle exec updates the lockfile beforehand.\n\n   Loading\n       By default, when attempting to bundle exec to a file with a ruby\n       shebang, Bundler will Kernel.load that file instead of using\n       Kernel.exec. For the vast majority of cases, this is a performance\n       improvement. In a rare few cases, this could cause some subtle\n       side-effects (such as dependence on the exact contents of $0 or\n       __FILE__) and the optimization can be disabled by enabling the\n       disable_exec_load setting.\n\n   Shelling out\n       Any Ruby code that opens a subshell (like system, backticks, or %x{})\n       will automatically use the current Bundler environment. If you need to\n       shell out to a Ruby command that is not part of your current bundle,\n       use the with_clean_env method with a block. Any subshells created\n       inside the block will be given the environment present before Bundler\n       was activated. For example, Homebrew commands run Ruby, but don´t work\n       inside a bundle:\n\n\n\n\t   Bundler.with_clean_env do\n\t     `brew install wget`\n\t   end"

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `bundle-exec`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nUsing with_clean_env is also necessary if you are shelling out to a\n       different bundle. Any Bundler commands run in a subshell will inherit\n       the current Gemfile, so commands that need to run in the context of a\n       different bundle also need to use with_clean_env.\n\n\n\n\t   Bundler.with_clean_env do\n\t     Dir.chdir \"/other/bundler/project\" do\n\t       `bundle exec ./script`\n\t     end\n\t   end\n\n\n\n\n       Bundler provides convenience helpers that wrap system and exec, and\n       they can be used like this:\n\n\n\n\t   Bundler.clean_system(´brew install wget´)\n\t   Bundler.clean_exec(´brew install wget´)\n\n\n\n\nRUBYGEMS PLUGINS\n       At present, the Rubygems plugin system requires all files named\n       rubygems_plugin.rb on the load path of any installed gem when any Ruby\n       code requires rubygems.rb. This includes executables installed into the\n       system, like rails, rackup, and rspec.\n\n       Since Rubygems plugins can contain arbitrary Ruby code, they commonly\n       end up activating themselves or their dependencies.\n\n       For instance, the gemcutter 0.5 gem depended on json_pure. If you had\n       that version of gemcutter installed (even if you also had a newer\n       version without this problem), Rubygems would activate gemcutter 0.5\n       and json_pure <latest>.\n\n       If your Gemfile(5) also contained json_pure (or a gem with a dependency\n       on json_pure), the latest version on your system might conflict with\n       the version in your Gemfile(5), or the snapshot version in your\n       Gemfile.lock.\n\n       If this happens, bundler will say:\n\n\n\n\t   You have already activated json_pure 1.4.6 but your Gemfile\n\t   requires json_pure 1.4.3. Consider using bundle exec."
