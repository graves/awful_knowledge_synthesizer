By\n     default, osascript treats plain text as AppleScript, but you can change\n     this using the -l option.\tTo get a list of the OSA languages installed\n     on your system, use osalang(1).\n\n     osascript will look for the script in one of the following three places:\n\n     1.   Specified line by line using -e switches on the command line.\n\n     2.   Contained in the file specified by the first filename on the command\n\t  line.  This file may be plain text or a compiled script.\n\n     3.   Passed in using standard input.  This works only if there are no\n\t  filename arguments; to pass arguments to a STDIN-read script, you\n\t  must explicitly specify “-” for the script name."

Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `osascript`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nAny arguments following the script will be passed as a list of strings to\n     the direct parameter of the “run” handler.  For example, in AppleScript:\n\n\t   a.scpt:\n\t   on run argv\n\t       return \"hello, \" & item 1 of argv & \".\"\n\t   end run\n\n\t   % osascript a.scpt world\n\t   hello, world.\n\n     The options are as follows:\n\n     -e statement\n\t   Enter one line of a script.\tIf -e is given, osascript will not\n\t   look for a filename in the argument list.  Multiple -e options may\n\t   be given to build up a multi-line script.  Because most scripts use\n\t   characters that are special to many shell programs (for example,\n\t   AppleScript uses single and double quote marks, “(”, “)”, and “*”),\n\t   the statement will have to be correctly quoted and escaped to get\n\t   it past the shell intact.\n\n     -i    Interactive mode: osascript will prompt for one line at a time, and\n\t   print the result, if applicable, after each line.  Any script\n\t   supplied as a command argument using -e or programfile will be\n\t   loaded, but not executed, before starting the interactive prompt."

For\n\t      example, the lists ‘{\"foo\", \"bar\"}’ and ‘{{\"foo\", {\"bar\"}}}’\n\t      would both be displayed as ‘foo, bar’.
