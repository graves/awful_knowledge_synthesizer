Here is some text copied from the manpages of the macOS resource `iwidgets_scrolledframe`.\n\n\n\nManpage text:\n\nDESCRIPTION\n       The scrolledframe combines the functionallity of scrolling with that of\n       a typical frame widget to implement a clipable viewing area whose\n       visible region may be modified with the scroll bars. This enables the\n       contruction of visually larger areas than which could normally be\n       displayed, containing a heterogenous mix of other widgets. Options\n       exist which allow full control over which scrollbars are displayed and\n       the method, i.e. statically or dynamically. The frame itself may be\n       accessed by the childsite method and then filled with other widget\n       combinations.\n\n\nMETHODS\n       The iwidgets::scrolledframe command creates a new Tcl command whose\n       name is pathName.  This command may be used to invoke various\n       operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:\n\n\t      pathName option ?arg arg ...?\n\n       Option and the args determine the exact behavior of the command.  The\n       following commands are possible for scrolledframe widgets:\n\nASSOCIATED METHODS\n       xview\t       yview\n\n       See the \"canvas\" manual entry for details on the associated methods."
