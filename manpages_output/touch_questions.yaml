If\n     any file does not exist, it is created with default permissions.\n\n     By default, touch changes both modification and access times.  The -a and\n     -m flags may be used to select the access time or the modification time\n     individually.  Selecting both is equivalent to the default.  By default,\n     the timestamps are set to the current time.  The -d and -t flags\n     explicitly specify a different time, and the -r flag specifies to set the\n     times those of the specified file.  The -A flag adjusts the values by a\n     specified amount.\n\n     The following options are available:\n\n     -A      Adjust the access and modification time stamps for the file by\n\t     the specified value.  This flag is intended for use in modifying\n\t     files with incorrectly set time stamps."

The modification time of the\n\t     file is not changed unless the -m flag is also specified.\n\n     -c      Do not create the file if it does not exist.

No error messages are displayed\n\t     and the exit value is not affected.\n\n     -d      Change the access and modification times to the specified date\n\t     time instead of the current time of day.  The argument is of the\n\t     form “YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:SS[.frac][tz]” where the letters represent\n\t     the following:\n\t\t   YYYY    At least four decimal digits representing the year.\n\t\t   MM, DD, hh, mm, SS\n\t\t\t   As with -t time.\n\t\t   T\t   The letter T or a space is the time designator.\n\t\t   .frac   An optional fraction, consisting of a period or a\n\t\t\t   comma followed by one or more digits.  The number\n\t\t\t   of significant digits depends on the kernel\n\t\t\t   configuration and the filesystem, and may be zero.\n\t\t   tz\t   An optional letter Z indicating the time is in UTC.\n\t\t\t   Otherwise, the time is assumed to be in local time.\n\t\t\t   Local time is affected by the value of the TZ\n\t\t\t   environment variable."
